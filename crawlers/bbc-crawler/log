{"hash":"24232092ba8e6ddcc9381811fe752225","title":"Russian military plane crash in Syria kills dozens","author":"bbc","feed":"world","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-43305835","content":"A Russian military transport plane has crashed in Syria killing more than 30 people, the defence ministry says. The An-26 plane crashed during landing at Hmeimim airbase, near the coastal city of Latakia, the ministry is quoted as saying by Russian media. It says all 39 military personnel on board died, not 32 as earlier reported. The plane was not fired upon, the ministry says, and preliminary data suggests a technical malfunction could have caused the crash. An investigation is now under way. Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed condolences to the victims\u0027 relatives. Meanwhile, medics in the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area of Syria say they have been treating people with breathing problems after a suspected chlorine attack. The reports follow government air strikes and shelling just hours after the last UN aid envoy left the enclave following a supposed five-hour truce. In a separate development, UN war crimes investigators say air strikes in Syria by both Russia and the US-led coalition killed large numbers of civilians last year. What is known about Tuesday\u0027s plane crash?\nThe Russian defence ministry says the An-26 crashed at about 15:00 Moscow Time (12:00 GMT). It says the plane went down about 500m (1640ft) from the runway. A special commission is to be set up to investigate the crash. On 7 January, Russian forces said they had foiled a drone attack on Hmeimim. This was just a week after Russian warplanes were damaged at the airbase in a rebel mortar attack. Hmeimim is Russia\u0027s main base for air strikes on rebel groups in Syria - strikes that have enabled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u0027s forces to recover much lost ground. What are Russia\u0027s air force losses in Syria?\nRussia launched its military operation in September 2015, saying it was acting upon a request by President Assad. Here are the confirmed air force losses: What about the suspected chlorine attack in Eastern Ghouta?\nThe attack targeted the town of Hammoria and led to the evacuation of dozens of civilians, according to the Syrian Civil Defence, whose volunteer rescue workers are widely known as the White Helmets. Local medics said they were treating a number of people who had breathing problems. Syria denied allegations it had carried out the attack, dismissing them as an act of desperation by Western powers. Meanwhile, Russia - a key ally of the Syrian government - offered rebels safe passage out of the area. What did UN war crimes investigators say?\nThey said they found that an attack by the US-coalition on a school near the city of Raqqa last March killed 150 local residents - many times more than Washington had admitted to. The investigators also said Russian air strikes on a market in Atareb, west of Aleppo, killed at least 84 people last November. Their report talked too of chemical weapons attacks by Syrian government forces, and war crimes allegedly committed by their rebel opponents.

{"hash":"369700ac371be4876b8723228b932967","title":"North Korea is willing to discuss disarmament, says South","author":"bbc","feed":"world","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-43296671","content":"North Korea is willing to talk about getting rid of its nuclear weapons but only if its own safety can be guaranteed, South Korea says. The South says the subject was raised when its officials met with the North\u0027s leader, Kim Jong-un, in Pyongyang on Monday, during a rare visit. They said Mr Kim is also open to US talks, and would pause weapons testing. In previous programmes to halt its nuclear ambitions, the North has failed to keep its promises. The leaders of North and South Korea have also agreed to meet at a summit next month, Seoul\u0027s envoy says. It will be the first such meeting for more than a decade and the first since Kim Jong-un took power in North Korea. Mr Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in will meet on the heavily fortified border next month, at the truce village of Panmunjom. The countries also agreed to open a hotline between the leaders. Throughout February\u0027s Winter Olympics in South Korea, the two countries struck a friendly tone, sending athletes to compete in a joint team and holding talks. But the US maintained that North Korean gestures of rapprochement would carry little weight without a commitment on nuclear weapons - particularly following last year\u0027s nuclear and missile tests carried out by the North. The South Korean delegation is expected to visit Washington later this week to brief US officials on their talks in the North. What is North Korea reported to have said?\nA statement from the South Korea president\u0027s office said: \"The North showed willingness on denuclearisation in the Korean Peninsula. If military threats to the North Korea decrease and regime safety is guaranteed, the North showed that it has no reason to retain nukes.\" The North\u0027s KCNA news agency said Mr Kim had \"warmly welcomed\" the delegates and held an \"openhearted talk\" with them. It said the dinner took place \"in a warm atmosphere overflowing with compatriotic feelings\". However, some critics have suspicions over North Korea\u0027s intentions. In the past, they have failed to follow through on deals, notably an aid-for-disarmament agreement in 2005. Where does the US stand?\nThe United States has said it will only go in to formal talks with North Korea if Pyongyang is ready to give up its nuclear weapons. After the news from the South Korean officials was made public, President Donald Trump tweeted: \"The World is watching and waiting!\" \"May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!\" Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction! End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump Vice-President Mike Pence added: \"All options are on the table and our posture toward the regime will not change until we see credible, verifiable, and concrete steps toward denuclearization.\" Meanwhile, China\u0027s foreign ministry said it hopes the Koreas can continue with efforts to advance reconciliation, Reuters news agency reported. What next?\nAnalysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence correspondent This is, of course, South Korea\u0027s take on what North Korea is offering. Some of the suggestions are, at face value, encouraging - not least North Korea\u0027s apparent willingness to discuss the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. However, its conditions - that the military threat to North Korea is reduced and regime safety is guaranteed - raise all sorts of questions. The North also says that it is willing to talk to the US with the goal of normalising relations with Washington. The most positive element is the most immediate; that the period of calm initiated by the Winter Olympics looks set to continue. \"While the dialogues continue,\" the South says, \"the North will not conduct any nuclear tests, missile launches or other provocations.\" (Surely not Pyongyang\u0027s words!) The two Koreas appear willing to create diplomatic space to try to improve relations across the board. Much will now depend upon how Washington reacts. What happened at the Pyongyang dinner?\nSouth Korean officials had a four-hour dinner with Kim Jong-un on Monday. Among the delegation were intelligence chief Suh Hoon and National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong. Pictures showed Mr Kim and visitors from the South smiling broadly around a dinner table. Also present was Mr Kim\u0027s wife, Ri Sol-ju, who rarely appears at official events, and his sister Kim Yo-jong, who was part of a North Korean delegation to the Pyeongchang Olympics. The two sides appear to be aiming to capitalise on the reduced tensions after the Games, which saw the Koreas march together under one flag. During their visit, the South\u0027s officials also held a boardroom meeting and passed on a letter from South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in which he invited Mr Kim to attend further talks. KCNA said Mr Kim had \"exchanged views and made a satisfactory agreement\" on the letter and gave orders for it to be acted on. The South\u0027s delegates returned to Seoul on Tuesday morning, the South Korean news agency Yonhap said. Has this ever happened before?\nThese were the first officials from Seoul to meet Mr Kim since he came to power. Kim Jong-un has met very few foreign officials since he became leader in 2011 and the last time envoys from the South visited Pyongyang was in 2007. Two previous summits were held in 2000 and 2007, under South Korean presidents Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun who met Kim\u0027s father, Kim Jong-il. The South\u0027s officials have stressed the talks were only preliminary, but the parties had \"somewhat shared\" views on some issues.

Tonya Illman picked up the bottle while going for a walk around sand dunes on a remote beach in West Australia. Her husband Kym Illman told the BBC they found some paper in the bottle but had \"no idea\" what it was until they took it home and dried it in the oven. Experts have confirmed it is an authentic message from a German ship. The note in the bottle, which was dated 12 June 1886, was jettisoned from the German ship Paula, as part of an experiment into ocean and shipping routes by the German Naval Observatory. Previously, the Guinness world record for the oldest message in a bottle was 108 years, between it being sent and found. \u0027Rolled up cigarette\u0027\nThe Illman family were driving through a beach north of Wedge Island on 21 January when the car became bogged down in the sand, and Mrs Illman and her friend decided to go for a walk. \"Tonya saw a whole lot of rubbish on the ground, and thought she\u0027d help pick up some rubbish,\" Mr Illman told the BBC. She found and picked up the bottle, thinking it would be nice for her bookshelf, he added. Mr Illman said his wife passed the bottle \"to our son\u0027s girlfriend, who saw what she thought was a rolled-up cigarette, and tipped it out with the sand\". \"Tonya tried to untie the string around the paper, but it was rather fragile, so we took it home and put it in the oven for five minutes to dry up the moisture. \"Then we unrolled it and saw printed writing. We could not see the hand written ink at that point, but saw a printed message that asked the reader to contact the German consulate when they found the note.\" Later, they also noticed faint handwriting on the note, with a date of 12 June 1886 and the name of the ship, Paula. When they saw the date they thought it was \"too far-fetched\" to be real, Mr Illman said - but they researched the bottle online and took it to experts at the Western Australian Museum. Dr Ross Anderson, Assistant Curator Maritime Archaeology at the WA Museum, confirmed the find was authentic after consulting with colleagues from Germany and the Netherlands. \"Incredibly, an archival search in Germany found Paula\u0027s original Meteorological Journal and there was an entry for 12 June 1886 made by the captain, recording a drift bottle having been thrown overboard. The date and the coordinates correspond exactly with those on the bottle message,\" Dr Anderson said. The handwriting on the journal, and the message in the bottle, also matched, he added. The bottle was jettisoned in the south-eastern Indian Ocean while the ship was travelling from Cardiff in Wales to Indonesia, and probably washed up on the Australian coast within 12 months, where it was buried under the sand, he wrote in his report. Thousands of bottles were thrown overboard during the 69-year German experiment but to date only 662 messages - and no bottles - had been returned. The last bottle with a note to be found was in Denmark in 1934. The bottle found on Wedge Island was found \"mostly exposed without any form of cork or closure, and was about a quarter full of damp sand\", and the bottle appeared to have lain \"buried or mostly buried\", partially filled with damp sand, Dr Anderson added. Sand dunes in the area are quite mobile during storm events and heavy rain, so the bottle could have been subject to \"cyclical periods of exposure\" which could have led to the cork in the bottle drying out and becoming dislodged, \"while the tightly rolled paper along with a quantity of sand remained inside preserved\". \"The narrow 7mm bore of the bottle opening and thick glass would have assisted to buffer and preserve the paper from the effects of full exposure to the elements, providing a protective microenvironment favourable to the paper\u0027s long-term preservation,\" the report added. You might also like\nThe Illman family have loaned the find to the Western Australian Museum for the next two years, and it will be on display to the public from Wednesday. WA Minister for Culture and the Arts David Templeman said he was \"delighted\" with the loan, adding: \"It is truly an impressive find and thanks to the wonderful international and interdisciplinary cooperation of science and research, it can now also be shared with the world.\" Writing online, Mrs Illman described the find as \"the most remarkable event in my life\". \"To think that this bottle has not been touched for nearly 132 years and is in perfect condition, despite the elements, beggars belief. I\u0027m still shaking.\" Reporting by the BBC\u0027s Helier Cheung. ","date":1520334070000,"topics":["Germany","Australia"]}

Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are critically ill in hospital after being found unconscious in Salisbury, Wiltshire. The foreign secretary said he was not pointing fingers at this stage, but described Russia as \"a malign and disruptive force\". Russia has denied any involvement. Counter Terrorism Police have taken over the investigation from Wiltshire Police. But in a statement, the unit said the inquiry had not been declared a terrorist incident and there was no risk to the wider public. Family deaths\nMr Skripal\u0027s relatives have told the BBC Russian Service that the former spy believed the Russian special services might come after him at any time. His wife, elder brother and his son have died in the past two years, some in mysterious circumstances, the family believe. Ms Skripal is based in Moscow and has visited her father in the UK regularly, especially over the past two years. Mr Skripal - a former Russian agent convicted of spying for Britain - and his daughter were found slumped on a bench outside a shopping centre on Sunday afternoon. Before that, they had been seen walking through an alley leading from a Zizzi restaurant, which has now been \"secured\" by police. The Bishop\u0027s Mill pub has also been cordoned off as a precaution. Scientists at Porton Down - the UK\u0027s secret weapons research facility in Wiltshire - are studying the \"unknown substance\" that is thought to have made the pair ill. Mr Johnson told MPs: \"Honourable members will note the echoes of the death of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006. \"I say to governments around the world that no attempt to take innocent life on UK soil will go unsanctioned or unpunished.\" Mr Johnson said that if it emerged Russia was linked to the incident in Salisbury \"it would be very difficult to imagine\" that UK representation at this summer\u0027s football World Cup could go ahead in the \"normal way\". Aides to Mr Johnson say he was referring to \"officials\" - and not the England team. You may also be interested in:\nMr Johnson said the UK was \"in the lead across the world\" in trying to counteract a \"host of malign activity\" by Russia. In a statement, the Russian embassy in London said: \"Media reports create an impression of a planned operation by the Russian special services, which is completely untrue.\" Responding to Mr Johnson\u0027s comments, the Russian embassy added: \"We regret that instead of a proper official clarification on the issue the Foreign Secretary chose to threaten Russia with retribution. \"Looks like the script of yet another anti-Russian campaign has been already written.\" Analysis\nBy Norman Smith, BBC assistant political editor Although Boris Johnson was careful to stress this was still an ongoing investigation - it\u0027s absolutely clear he, and others in government, believe it\u0027s highly likely this was a Russian state-sponsored attack. The big question now - how does the government respond? A question made more pressing by accusations that ministers were guilty of appeasement in the wake of Alexander Litvinenko\u0027s killing. Mr Johnson suggested there could be targeted sanctions against those close to President Putin. And, perhaps most significantly, in an indication the government could seek to rally international support to make a stand against Russia, Mr Johnson said there could be a co-ordinated response with Nato allies. Whatever measures are eventually decided upon - if Russian involvement is proven - it\u0027s clear relations between London and Moscow have plunged to new depths. Andrei Lugovoi, the former Russian agent accused of poisoning ex-spy Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006, told the BBC that Russia would have considered the matter closed when Mr Skripal was flown to the UK as part of a spy swap in 2010. Mr Skripal was pardoned by the Russian President and so the incident was over, Mr Lugovoi said. Igor Sutyagin, who was one of four agents released by Moscow in the exchange, is now a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). He told the BBC\u0027s World Tonight programme that he was not yet concerned for his safety and added: \"I don\u0027t think that he (Mr Skripal) would be targeted, because he was pardoned.\" Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, but says it is open to co-operating with British police if requested. Police are currently examining CCTV footage, filmed by a Salisbury gym, showing an unidentified man and woman - thought to be Mr Skripal and his daughter - walking near the location where they were found. Wiltshire Police has said two officers caught up in the suspected contamination have been treated in hospital for minor symptoms, before they were given the all clear. It is understood their symptoms included itchy eyes and wheezing. A third member of the emergency services remains in hospital. In Salisbury, some residents have told the BBC of their surprise at the incident happening in the small city, while others are seemingly unruffled. \"I\u0027m not nervous for my own safety,\" says Sue Doe, smoking a cigarette a stone\u0027s throw from Zizzi\u0027s. \"I\u0027m just interested to know what\u0027s happened.\" Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK\u0027s Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI as part of a swap. He was later flown to the UK. According to BBC Newsnight\u0027s diplomatic editor Mark Urban, in recent years Col Skripal gave lectures at military academies offering insight into Russia\u0027s foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU. Read more about Sergei Skripal\u0027s background here. Putin, power and poison: Russia’s elite FSB spy club The possibility of an unexplained substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko. The Russian dissident and former intelligence officer died in London after drinking tea laced with a radioactive substance. A public inquiry concluded that his killing had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Mr Litvinenko\u0027s widow, Marina Litvinenko, told BBC Radio 4\u0027s The World Tonight that the latest incident felt like \"deja vu\" - and called for those receiving political asylum to be protected by the UK.

Ryszard Masierak, 31, was at twice the drink-drive limit and had stopped in the inside lane when he was involved in the crash with a minibus and another lorry near Newport Pagnell. He was found guilty of eight counts of causing death by dangerous driving. The jury at Reading Crown Court is still deliberating charges against the other lorry driver, David Wagstaff. Masierak was also convicted of four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving after the crash last August. Wagstaff, 54, of Derwent Street, Stoke-on-Trent, denies the same charges. The trial heard Masierak\u0027s vehicle was stopped in the carriageway for about 12 minutes - an act described by prosecutor Oliver Saxby QC as \"as flagrant as it was dangerous\". The eight people killed were all travelling in the minibus, which was carrying 11 Indian tourists from Nottingham to London ahead of a trip to Disneyland Paris. The six men and two women were driver Cyriac Joseph, Panneerselvam Annamalai, Rishi Ranjeev Kumar, Vivek Baskaran, Lavanyalakshmi Seetharaman, Karthikeyan Pugalur Ramasubramanian, Subramaniyan Arachelvan and Tamilmani Arachelvan. Four other passengers - including a four-year-old girl orphaned by the crash - spent weeks in hospital afterwards. The court was told AIM Logistics driver Masierak, a Polish national, stopped in the carriageway at about 02:57 BST, despite there being miles of hard shoulder available. He admitted he had consumed alcohol. He told the court he stopped because he was sweating, felt weak and had a headache and had attempted to get onto the hard shoulder. Masierak, of Barnards Close, Evesham, Worcestershire, then said he lost consciousness, only to be woken from what he described as a \"small coma\" when the crash happened. Wagstaff has been released on continuing bail. ","date":1520358449000,"topics":["Stoke-on-Trent","Newport Pagnell","Evesham","Nottingham"]}

The reports follow government air strikes and shelling just hours after the last UN aid envoy left the enclave following a supposed five-hour truce. Syria denied allegations it had carried out the attack, dismissing them as an act of desperation by Western powers. Russia meanwhile has offered rebels safe passage out of the area. The latest suspected chemical attack targeted the town of Hammoria and led to the evacuation of dozens of civilians, according to the Syrian Civil Defence, whose volunteer rescue workers are widely known as the White Helmets. The group tweeted that \"more 30 suffocation cases\", including women and children, were reported following what it described as a \"regime gas attack\". The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) monitoring group, which uses a network of sources on the ground, said it could not specify the cause of the illnesses. Syrian state media suggested the attack had been staged amid \"desperate attempts by some Western countries in the [UN] Security Council and the Human Rights Council to rescue terrorists who will face their inevitable end at the hands of the Syrian Arab Army\". The UN Human Rights Council has ordered an investigation into the recent violence, and has already condemned the alleged use of chemical weapons. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has dismissed dire assessments of the humanitarian situation in the enclave as \"ridiculous lies\". On Tuesday, the Russian military said in a statement that its forces would provide transport and security for the rebels and their families looking to leave the besieged enclave. The offer, which would allow rebels with personal weapons through a secure corridor, could pave the way for a deal by which the opposition would surrender its last major stronghold near Damascus to Mr Assad. A spokesman for one of the dominant rebel groups in Eastern Ghouta, Faylaq al-Rahman, accused Russia - Syria\u0027s key ally - of military escalation and of trying to displace the population by force. On Monday, 94 civilians were killed amid Syrian government air strikes in Eastern Ghouta, despite a supposed five-hour truce, according to the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM), which operates medical facilities there. A UN convoy delivering the first aid since February to the town of Douma was forced to cut short its mission and left after nearly nine hours amid shelling. The UN\u0027s refugee agency said 10 out of more than 40 trucks had not been emptied. The Syrian Red Crescent earlier said 46 truckloads of food parcels were delivered to 27,500 people, along with health items for more than 70,000 people in Douma. More than 700 people have been killed in violence in Eastern Ghouta since the government intensified its offensive in recent weeks, many of them children. Several reports suggest government forces are attempting to cut the region - home to about 393,000 people - in two.

The UN envoy\u0027s assessment of a continued \"campaign of terror and forced starvation\" comes six months after a military crackdown caused a mass exodus of Rohingya Muslims. Some 700,000 people have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh since August. They have since told of murder, rape and arson by soldiers and vigilantes. Myanmar\u0027s military says it is fighting Rohingya militants and denies targeting civilians in Rakhine state. \"The ethnic cleansing of Rohingya from Myanmar continues,\" said the UN\u0027s assistant secretary-general for human rights, Andrew Gilmour. \"I don\u0027t think we can draw any other conclusion from what I have seen and heard in Cox\u0027s Bazar,\" he added, referring to a district in southern Bangladesh which is home to most of the refugees. \"The nature of the violence has changed from the frenzied blood-letting and mass rape of last year to a lower intensity campaign of terror and forced starvation,\" Mr Gilmour said after speaking with recently arrived Rohingya in packed refugee camps, according to AFP. Bangladesh and Myanmar authorities had been in talks over repatriating refugees in the coming months but a build up of Myanmar military on the border last week sparked concern. The UN envoy said it was \"inconceivable\" for any Rohingya to return to Rakhine state in the near future in a \"safe, dignified and sustainable\" way. \"The government of Myanmar is busy telling the world that it is ready to receive Rohingya returnees, while at the same time its forces are continuing to drive them into Bangladesh,\" Mr Gilmour said. Safety in the sewage\nBy Anbarasan Ethirajan, Balukhali refugee camp, near Cox\u0027s Bazar In the months since they arrived, most of the 700,000 Rohingya refugees now appear to be in camps with a roof over their heads and food provided by aid agencies. They are no longer living on roadsides or in the jungle. But a walk through Balukhali, one of the largest refugee camps in the world, is a staggering and intense experience. More than 300,000 men, women and children are cramped in shacks made of bamboo and plastic sheeting. There are rivulets of sewage running through the camps. Most of the shacks are sitting precariously on hill terraces. I could see dozens of men, women and even children carrying their weekly food rations. The refugees may feel safer, but the real challenge will start once the monsoon begins in a couple of months.

The USS Lexington was found 3km (2 miles) underwater in the Coral Sea, about 800km off Australia\u0027s east coast. The ship was lost in the Battle of the Coral Sea, fought with Japan from 4-8 May 1942. More than 200 crew members died in the fighting. The US Navy confirmed the ship had been discovered by a search team led by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. Pictures showed the wreck to be well preserved. The discovery of the Lexington, along with 11 of its 35 aircraft, was made by Mr Allen\u0027s company Vulcan on Sunday. An exciting announcement regarding USS Lexington (CV-2)! Though Lexington was lost in the Battle of the Coral Sea, the valiant efforts of her men crippled IJN carriers Shōkaku and Zuikaku so that they were unable to take part at Midway, setting the stage for an Allied victory. https://t.co/KaAPsOtRqO End of Twitter post by @PacificCommand Adm Harry Harris, head of the US Pacific Command, praised the discovery. \"As the son of a survivor of the USS Lexington, I offer my congratulations to Paul Allen and the expedition crew of Research Vessel (R/V) Petrel for locating the \u0027Lady Lex\u0027,\" he said on Tuesday. The Battle of the Coral Sea is considered a key moment in halting Japan\u0027s advance in the Pacific during the war. The Lexington was scuttled by US forces after being struck by several Japanese torpedoes and bombs during the battle. The US Navy said 216 crew members died after the ship was attacked. More than 2,000 others were rescued. \"Lexington was on our priority list because she was one of the capital ships that was lost during WWII,\" Vulcan spokesman Robert Kraft said. Pictures from the seabed taken by the Petrel show the Lexington\u0027s nameplate and guns. Some of the ship\u0027s aircraft are also shown in remarkably good condition. The ship will not be retrieved because the US Navy considers it to be a war grave. Mr Kraft said it had taken about six months of planning to locate the ship. Last year, Vulcan discovered the wreck of the USS Indianapolis, which sank in July 1945. It has found other vessels including a Japanese warship, the Musashi, and an Italian naval vessel, Artigliere - both from the same era.

Profs John Hardy, Bart De Strooper, Michael Goedert, based in the UK, and Prof Christian Haass, from Germany, unpicked key protein changes that lead to this most common type of dementia. On getting the award, Prof Hardy said he hoped new treatments could be found. He is donating some of his prize money to care for Alzheimer\u0027s patients. Much of the drug discovery research that\u0027s done today builds on their pioneering work, looking for ways to stop the build-up of damaging proteins, such as amyloid and tau. Alzheimer\u0027s and other dementias affect 50 million people around the world, and none of the treatments currently available can stop the disease. Path to beating Alzheimer\u0027s\nProf Hardy\u0027s work includes finding rare, faulty genes linked to Alzheimer\u0027s disease. These genetic errors implicated a build-up of amyloid as the event that kick-starts damage to nerve cells in Alzheimer\u0027s. This idea, known as the amyloid cascade hypothesis, has been central to Alzheimer\u0027s research for nearly 30 years. Together with Prof Haass, who is from the University of Munich, Prof Hardy, who\u0027s now at University College London, then discovered how amyloid production changes in people with rare inherited forms of Alzheimer\u0027s dementia. How one woman and her family transformed Alzheimer\u0027s research Prof Goedert\u0027s research at Cambridge University, meanwhile, revealed the importance of another damaging protein, called tau, while Prof De Stooper, who is the new director of the UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL, discovered how genetic errors that alter the activity of proteins called secretases can lead to Alzheimer\u0027s processes. Dr David Reynolds, Chief Scientific Officer at Alzheimer\u0027s Research UK, said: \"Our congratulations go to all four of these outstanding scientists whose vital contributions have transformed our understanding of the complex causes of Alzheimer\u0027s disease. \"The fact that three of these researchers work in the UK reflects the country\u0027s position as a global leader in dementia research.\" Prof Hardy said he would be donating around 5,000 euros of his share of the 1m euros from the Lundbeck Foundation to help campaigns to keep Britain in the EU, and called Brexit a \"unmitigated disaster\" for scientific research. He also pledged his thanks to all the people with Alzheimer\u0027s who, over the years, have volunteered to help with dementia research.

{"hash":"b66acc4a610f46ba04e1a938a868e420","title":"Florida shooting: State lawmakers pass gun control measures","author":"bbc","feed":"world","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-43298384","content":"Florida lawmakers have voted to enact new gun control measures, weeks after one of the worst school shootings in US history took place in the state. The Senate narrowly passed a bill that would raise the age to buy a firearm from 18 to 21 and require a three-day waiting period for most weapons. Senators voted 20-18 in favour, after an amendment removed a provision to arm classroom teachers. The law now requires approval from the House of Representatives and governor. Seventeen people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the Florida city of Parkland on 14 February by former student Nikolas Cruz. Many of the surviving students had called on politicians do more than give \"thoughts and prayers\" and protested for greater gun control. Emotional testimony\nThe national minimum age to buy a handgun is already 21. Florida law mandates a three-day waiting period before the purchase of a handgun is completed. However, a person as young as 18 can buy a rifle in Florida, with no waiting period. Mr Cruz was 18 years old when he purchased the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle he turned on students and school staff, authorities said according to Reuters. Senators listened to three hours of often emotional testimony before voting. \"Do I think this bill goes far enough? No! No, I don\u0027t!\" Democratic Senator Lauren Book told the AP news agency. She said she hoped for a ban on assault weapons, but the Senate had already rejected the provision at the weekend. Armed \u0027marshals\u0027 in schools\nUnder the bill, classroom teachers have been exempted from a new voluntary armed \"marshals\" programme for schools in Florida. The programme - named after Aaron Feis, a coach who died in the Parkland shooting - will allow school staff who do not teach in classrooms to be armed, subject to school district approval and specialist training. The exemption of classroom teachers was deemed necessary to get the bill passed. Republican Governor Rick Scott - who has the final say on the bill - has opposed arming teachers. Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School parents and students had also decried the proposal. A ban on the sale or possession of bump fire stocks - a piece of metal or plastic that allows a semi-automatic weapon to fire rounds of bullets in seconds, much like a machine gun - was also approved. The new bill represents a break with the National Rifle Association (NRA), which has resisted proposals to raise age limits or impose new waiting limits. In the past few weeks, a number of companies have cut ties with the gun rights lobby by ending discounts for NRA members. Meanwhile, Oregon Governor Kate Brown signed into law on Monday a bill to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and people under restraining orders - a measure which the state touted as the first bill to pass since the Parkland massacre.

{"hash":"30f6f0af22850e5af5b0625f49852dbe","title":"France to set legal age of sexual consent as 15","author":"bbc","feed":"world","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-43300313","content":"France plans to fix the legal age of sexual consent as 15, meaning sex with someone younger than that would be considered rape. Equality Minister Marlène Schiappa welcomed the move, which follows advice from doctors and legal experts. Currently, prosecutors must prove sex with someone under 15 was forced in order to bring rape charges. The change comes amid uproar over two recent cases of men accused of having sex with 11-year-old girls. Under the existing legislation, if there is no violence or coercion proved, offenders may only be charged with sexual abuse of a minor and not rape. This has a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of €75,000 (£66,000; $87,000). Sentences are the same for sexual assaults of minors and non-minors, but rape convictions carry much harsher punishments. The government is to approve the new age limit as part of a package of other laws against sexual violence and harassment in the coming weeks. It had been discussing whether to set the age as 13 or 15, which is what groups fighting violence against children had campaigned for. Ms Schiappa told AFP news agency that she was \"very glad\" that the higher age was chosen. The limit is also supported by President Emmanuel Macron. Minister of Solidarity and Health Agnès Buzyn said setting a legal age of sexual consent would allow a \"collective awareness\" and that everyone would see what was \"legal and illegal\", Le Figaro newspaper reports (in French). Last November, a 30-year-old man was acquitted of rape after a court determined his 11-year-old victim had not been subjected to \"constraint, threat, violence or surprise\". In another case, a court initially said a 28-year-old man should face charges of sexual assault, and not rape, after saying the victim was not physically forced to have sex. But the same court reversed its decision last month, saying the accused should indeed face rape charges. Legislation varies across Europe, with countries setting different legal ages of consent: In the UK the age of sexual consent is 16, but children under the age of 13 have additional legal protections that declare they can never consent to sexual activity.

Scott Moore crashed into a house in Leigh and fought officers, threatening one with a Taser he stole from them. The ex-England rugby league star, 30, used \"his size and experience on the rugby field\" to evade arrest, Greater Manchester Police said. He was jailed for 23 months at Bolton Crown Court after admitting dangerous driving and assault. Moore, of Ranworth Drive, Lowton, Wigan, was disqualified from driving for two years. Police spotted Moore in the early hours of 14 October 2016 driving a black Mercedes at speed along Chaddock Lane towards the East Lancashire Road. He refused to pull over, sparking a pursuit during which he overtook a lorry at 100mph on a stretch of roadworks which had a speed limit of 30mph. He then accelerated at more than 150mph into a housing estate in Leigh and crashed into the wall of a house before stopping at a dead end, police said. \u0027Tug of war\u0027\nMoore elbowed an officer and \"violently resisted arrest in a struggle lasting 50 minutes\" during which he was Tasered six times but \"kept rising to his feet to fight and charge at officers\". At one point, the former St Helens, Widnes and Wakefield hooker grabbed the Taser\u0027s wires after being stunned and removed them from his body. He then grabbed the Taser in a \"tug of war\" with the officer, shouting: \"You\u0027re getting it now!\" while pointing it at the officer\u0027s face, police said. The terrified officer fought with Moore to release it from his hand and the other officer struck him numerous times. Moore eventually dropped the Taser and, following a further struggle, was detained. The officers had never in their careers \"been so scared nor witnessed such a violent individual\", Det Con Lynsey Watson-Perry said. One officer had to undergo surgery. \"Whatever level of force he is used to displaying on the pitch, this was not a game - people\u0027s lives were in danger\", she added.

A curfew is in place in the central district of Kandy, where crowds from the Buddhist Sinhala majority attacked a mosque, Muslim-owned shops and homes. The authorities fear retaliation after a young Muslim man\u0027s body was found in a burnt-out building on Tuesday. Tensions flared after the death of a Buddhist man who was said to have been beaten by some Muslims a week ago. Last week, the eastern town of Ampara also saw anti-Muslim violence over a dispute in a shop. A police curfew was declared in Kandy on Monday to prevent more sectarian clashes after the attacks carried out by a large Sinhala mob. It was briefly lifted on Tuesday, but soon re-imposed after the body of a 24-year-old Muslim man was found in the town of Digana. \"Four mosques, 37 houses, 46 shops and 35 vehicles damaged in Digana and Teldeniya area due to the mob attack,\" a local official told the BBC. \"Everything is destroyed. Muslims live in fear,\" he said. Tension has been on the rise in Sri Lanka since 2012, said to have been fuelled by hardline Buddhists. Under the state of emergency, the authorities are able to arrest and detain suspects for long periods, and deploy forces where needed. They will also take action against \"hate speech posts\" on social media, a cabinet spokesman told the BBC. It is the first time in seven years Sri Lanka has imposed the measure. The country was under a state of emergency for nearly three decades when the government fought Tamil rebels in the civil war that ended in 2009. ","date":1520335610000,"topics":["Sri Lanka"]}

A judge ruled last month that doctors at Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital in Liverpool can stop treating 21-month-old Alfie Evans against the wishes of his parents Kate James and Tom Evans. They want to take him abroad for treatment for his mystery illness but doctors said it would be \"futile\". Judges at London\u0027s Court of Appeal said they could appeal at the Supreme Court. Alfie\u0027s parents, from Bootle, Merseyside, were not at the hearing in London but Mr Evans said afterwards he would challenge the decision at the Supreme Court. He said: \"Some people might think why didn\u0027t they just end it there? \"But how can you end it when you\u0027ve got a two-year-old boy who\u0027s fighting as hard as you could ever picture him. \"At this moment, Alfie\u0027s not ready so we\u0027re not ready to let go.\" Alfie is in a \"semi-vegetative state\" and has an undiagnosed degenerative neurological condition. Announcing the decision at the Court of Appeal, Mrs Justice King said Alfie\u0027s parents were \"unable to accept what movements in Alfie they see are not positive responses\". Medical evidence showed that Alfie was \"deeply comatose\" and \"to all intents and purposes unaware of his surroundings\", she said. \u0027No clear plan\u0027\nMrs Justice King said Alfie\u0027s father wanted to move him to a hospital in Rome then, if necessary, to a hospital in Munich. She added he was passionate and wanted to \"fight on with Alfie\u0027s Army\" but she said he had \"no clear plan\". Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital said in a statement: \"Today the Court of Appeal upheld the judgement from the High Court that continued active treatment is not in Alfie\u0027s best interest. \"We understand that this is a very difficult time for Alfie\u0027s family and we will continue to work with them to agree the most appropriate palliative care plan for Alfie.\" Mr Justice Anthony Hayden said following a hearing at Liverpool Civil and Family Court he accepted medical evidence that showed further treatment was \"futile\" and gave doctors permission to provide palliative care only for Alfie. The hospital was set to withdraw ventilation on 23 February before his parents challenged the decision. Mrs Justice King said Mr Justice Hayden had considered all evidence presented to him and he \"could not have done more to ensure father and mother had every opportunity to express their views and have them taken into consideration\". She said his approach had been gentle and he could not have given the couple greater respect. But she said the best interests of the child had to prevail. She added he had been \"meticulous and thorough\" and had weighed all arguments raised. \u0027Death penalty\u0027\nBarrister Stephen Knafler QC, who is leading Alfie\u0027s parents\u0027 legal team, had said \"the state\" had wrongly interfered with \"parental choice\". He said Alfie\u0027s parents wanted to move him to the Vatican-linked Bambino Gesu Paediatric Hospital in Rome but Mr Justice Hayden\u0027s ruling had prevented them from doing that. Alfie\u0027s parents have until 16:00 GMT on Thursday to put a formal request to appeal the Court of Appeal\u0027s decision. An appeal by the parents of Isaiah Haastrup - a severely disabled boy at the centre of a life-support treatment dispute in London - has been dismissed at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France.

Sudan, who lives at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, enjoyed a mud bath in the rain on Monday, a spokesman told the BBC. However, they were still not holding out \"big hopes\" for a miracle recovery. The 45-year-old is one of just three remaining northern white rhinos and is the only male. Attempts to mate him with the two surviving female rhinos failed, however, and an account was created for him on the dating app Tinder last year, not to find love, but to help fund the development of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) for rhinos. The move won him fans across the world - many of whom were devastated on hearing news of his \"ailing condition\" last Thursday. Today is #WorldWildlifeDay, and we have been overwhelmed by the messages of concern, touching tributes and well wishes for Sudan. It has been a tough couple of days for us here at Ol Pejeta but your encouragement has kept us (and Sudan) going. pic.twitter.com/nVltnEK19e End of Twitter post by @OlPejeta Ol Pejeta\u0027s Elodie Sampere, told the BBC the rhino - who is the equivalent of 90 in human years, according to the reserve - had been suffering from bedsores as his mobility decreased, one of which had become infected. \"We are treating his wounds twice a day to avoid the risk of infection and they\u0027re getting better,\" she said on Tuesday. \"The sores are being made worse because he lies down too much.\" The reserve, which has been caring for Sudan and his two female companions since 2009, keeping them under 24-hour armed guard to protect them from poachers, has accepted the rhino will not be with them much longer. He had only recovered in the last few months from an infection which took hold late last year. However, they have been encouraged by Sudan\u0027s \"lifted spirits\" in the last few days. It’s been raining heavily on Ol Pejeta for the past couple of days and the weather certainly seems to have lifted Sudan’s spirits. He has been able to wallow in the mud - with the careful assistance of his caregivers – something that he seems to savour. pic.twitter.com/B0bhaIL7GN End of Twitter post 2 by @OlPejeta Sudan was retired from his role as a potential mate four years ago. But conservationists hope this does not mean the end for the northern white rhino. The two female rhinos - Najin and Fatu - are far younger, and progress with IVF may mean they are one day able to have their own calves. ","date":1520336886000,"topics":["Animals","Kenya"]}

The suspects allegedly held \"illegal meetings with bad intentions\" following the closure of more than 700 churches and a mosque in the capital Kigali. The government says the structures all fail to comply with building regulations and noise pollution laws. Among those arrested was famous pastor Bishop Rugagi Innocent. He was allegedly heard calling the decision to stop the churches from operating \"abrupt\", according to the BBC\u0027s Prudent Nsengiyumya. Rwandan police spokesman Theos Badege told news agency AFP on Tuesday the six Pentecostal preachers \"conducted illegal meetings with bad intentions aimed at calling for the directives to be defied\". \"After the suspension of churches that did not meet required standards, some church leaders began illegal meetings intended to defy and obstruct the directive,\" he added. \"Police began investigations to find the masterminds behind this illegal act.\" Most of the are churches closed were small Pentecostal ones. Pentecostal churches, often run by charismatic preachers claiming to be able to perform miracles, have grown rapidly in many parts of Africa in recent years. Some are massive, attracting thousands of worshippers each Sunday, but others consist of tiny structures built without planning permission. A government official told the BBC that some of the more than 700 buildings shut down have already reopened after they were approved by inspectors. According to a proposed new law, all preachers must have theological training before opening a church. Government official Justus Kangwagye told the BBC\u0027s Focus on Africa programme that they simply required the churches to meet \"modest standards\".

But as it finds itself at the centre of a modern-day mystery, what do the residents of Salisbury make of its new-found fame? Quiet. Normal. Quintessentially English. Words like these make medieval Salisbury seem an unlikely home for a former Russian spy. And yet on Sunday, this small city in Wiltshire found itself the topic of global conversation when current resident Sergei Skripal became ill near the main shopping centre. It would probably not have been newsworthy in itself, except it transpired he was once a military intelligence colonel who was convicted, and later pardoned, for passing the identities of Russian secret agents in Europe to the UK\u0027s intelligence service, MI6. When the 66-year-old and his 33-year-old daughter Yulia Skripa were found unconscious on a bench near The Maltings, police soon revealed they believed the pair had been exposed to an \"unknown substance\". Now, around the seat where they were found, a tent has been erected. The nearby branch of Zizzi is closed - a tight-lipped police officer guarding the door. The Mill pub, about 200m from the restaurant, is also shut. But far from perturbed by the activity unfolding around them, residents and workers simply zigzag around the cordons. People are more worried about the local pie shop being closed, says Leuene Jackman, peering over the police tape at the forensics team. \"Quite a few shops have been closed, it won\u0027t be good for business,\" she remarks. \"You just think this sort of thing happens in other parts of the country. \"This is such a quiet city.\" Typically known for its cathedral and proximity to Stonehenge, the city is one of the UK\u0027s smallest with a population of about 40,000 people. It has been home to many celebrities with Sting, Madonna and Guy Ritchie among those living in nearby villages. The late author Terry Pratchett and former prime minster Edward Heath also called Salisbury home. Now a far less famous resident has given the city the dubious honour of making it an unwitting backdrop to an unfolding mystery that has the hallmarks of a spy novel. \"It\u0027s just weird,\" says Janice Parks on of the main shopping thoroughfares. \"Salisbury is just so quintessentially English.\" She hurries on, rejoining the other shoppers navigating the narrow alleys and busy marketplace. \"It\u0027s business as usual really,\" says stall holder, Amanda Barlow. \"People have been looking up into the sky a bit more than normal, watching the circling helicopter. \"It\u0027s such a sleepy, tight-knit place. We were quite surprised but it hasn\u0027t put people off visiting.\" The hot topic of conversation in the cafes and shops has certainly been about \"that Russian spy\" - who despite the close-knit community cliché, seems relatively unknown to those milling around the streets. \"It goes to show we don\u0027t know who we live next door to,\" muses Penny Muxworthy, who lives just outside the city. \"People have jobs that might necessitate them [keeping from] people what it is that they do. \"It could happen anywhere.\" Outside the Mill pub, Frank Carter, agrees. \"Salisbury is out of the way isn\u0027t it,\" says the 87-year-old, who has lived there his whole life. \"You wouldn\u0027t expect it here.\" But many remain seemingly unruffled by the news. \"I\u0027m not nervous for my own safety,\" says Sue Doe, smoking a cigarette a stone\u0027s throw from the closed Zizzi restaurant. \"I\u0027m just interested to know what\u0027s happened.\" Others are less keen about the attention it has attracted. \"You\u0027re not from the telly are you? I don\u0027t want to be on the telly,\" said a man who did not want to be named. \"There\u0027s cameramen and [media] on every street corner, you can\u0027t move for them.\" For others, the publicity is a welcome moment in the spotlight. \"Well, it\u0027s definitely put Salisbury on the map,\" quips Doris Bright, before going about her day.

A 30-second trailer teases how her character\u0027s love affair ends, ahead of the second half of the latest season which airs in the US from 28 March. Meghan has played Rachel Zane since the show began in 2011, but will bow out at the end of this seventh series. The 36-year-old has quit acting to focus on her royal commitments, ahead of marrying Prince Harry on 19 May. From coworkers to lovers and everything in between.

But on the small screen she\u0027s been a key part of helping to make Suits a big success and the show gave her her big break. The new season will be the second half of the seventh series, while an eighth has already been confirmed. But Mike and Rachel won\u0027t be a part of the latter, meaning it\u0027s nearly time for fans to say an emotional goodbye. UK viewers can watch the show on Netflix from 29 March.

This is the question that has caused controversy after RuPaul admitted in a Guardian interview he would \"probably not\" accept a person who has transitioned gender competing on the show. A backlash ensued on social media as fans of the show and former contestants chimed in on the debate, and RuPaul has since apologised in a tweet which has been liked over 26,000 times. Each morning I pray to set aside everything I THINK I know, so I may have an open mind and a new experience. I understand and regret the hurt I have caused.

My drag was born in a community full of trans women, trans men, and gender non-conforming folks doing drag. That’s the real world of drag, like it or not.

End of Twitter post by @sasha_velour Velour\u0027s post was well received on Reddit\u0027s subsection dedicated to the show, where one user praised the 2017 winner for having the \"rebellion and guts to speak up when it\u0027s aimed at RuPaul while you\u0027re current reigning\". People in the RuPaul\u0027s Drag Race subreddit were initially critical of the host, with many praising the former contestants such as Velour for their comments. Following the apology, some fans praised RuPaul for his contrition, with one user saying they were \"very proud\" of the drag icon, and another saying \"this is a step in the right direction\". Outside of Reddit, other former contestants joined the conversation, with Season 2 contender Tatianna tweeting \"drag is for everyone,\" while All Stars contestant BenDeLaCreme spoke about having a partner who is trans. My partner of almost three years is trans, and #bendelachrist help anyone who tries to tell him what he can and can’t do. Just sayin’.

However police found no trace of the animal, which was described as yellow and 90cm (3ft) long. It is now thought the couple may have seen a leopard cat. Experts say tigers have not been seen in Hong Kong for more than 50 years. Leopard cats, which can grow up to about 70cm in length, are found in parts of Asia including China. The couple called the police on Tuesday morning after they saw the animal on Ma On Shan Country Park. They were escorted downhill by an officer. \"They claimed the animal was yellow in colour and measured about 3 feet by 2 feet. They were worried, so they called police,\" a police spokesman told the South China Morning Post. The couple were sent to hospital suffering from shock, Radio Television Hong Kong reported. The couple were later shown photos of various feline animals - and said a photo of a leopard cat was similar to the animal they saw. Dr Michael Lau, a director at the WWF\u0027s Wetlands Conservation department, told the BBC it was \"highly unlikely\" that the animal they saw was a wild tiger. \"The South China tiger is probably extirpated from the region, plus the size of the animal is small and if it were a tiger it would be a cub, [meaning that] its mother would be nearby and likely signs of kills would be seen by people,\" Dr Lau said. \"Hong Kong also no longer has enough space to support tigers. The last substantiated tiger sighting was in Shatin in 1947.\" Timothy Bonebrake of the School of Biological Sciences, University of Hong Kong, told the BBC \"the likelihood of it being a tiger is close to zero per cent\", and added that \"leopard cats that are relatively abundant in parts of Hong Kong\". While the South China tiger is considered to be \"functionally extinct\", the Leopard Cat population is considered stable. Leopard cats typically have yellow or reddish brown coats with dark spots and streaks, and are nocturnal. ","date":1520335439000,"topics":["China","Hong Kong"]}

The \"Super Monster Wolf\" is a 65cm-long, 50cm-tall robot animal covered with realistic-looking fur, featuring huge white fangs and flashing red eyes, Asahi Television reports. It\u0027s been designed to keep wild boar away from rice and chestnut crops, and was deployed on a trial basis near Kisarazu City in Japan\u0027s eastern Chiba prefecture last July. When it detects an approaching animal, its eyes light up and it starts to howl, Asahi TV says. Its manufacturers say the robot wolf uses solar-rechargeable batteries and has a range of howl noises so that animal threats don\u0027t get used to it. The Japan Agricultural Cooperatives say that crop losses have noticeably decreased in areas where the Super Monster Wolf has been present. Beforehand, farmers around Kisarazu were resigned to giving up at least part of their crops to wild boar every year. Speaking to the Chiba Nippo news website, Chihiko Umezawa of the agricultural cooperative says that the device has an effective radius of about one kilometre, suggesting it is more effective than an electric fence. Now, the robot wolf is going into mass production, with units costing about 514,000 yen ($4,840; £3,480) each, but there are options for farmers to pay a far cheaper monthly lease on a wolf instead.

The self-styled Laird McGillicuddy, otherwise known as Graeme Cairns, says he is using the Doctor Who time-travelling space craft to boycott the five-yearly census by \"travelling in time\", the New Zealand Herald reports. Mr Cairns, who was once the leader of the satirical McGillicuddy Serious Party, has a history of unusual stunts to protest the census, which is compulsory for all New Zealanders. He\u0027s once claimed not to be in New Zealand by hovering above the city of Hamilton in a hot-air balloon, and on another occasion declared himself \"temporarily dead\". He risks a fine of up to NZ$500 (US$362; £261) for refusing to fill out the form, the Stuff.co.nz website says. Five years ago, there were around 100 prosecutions for census avoidance. Census concerns\nWhile most of New Zealand\u0027s approximate 4.7m population are taking part in the census, some have concerns that the results may be skewed due to accessibility problems. The census is being conducted primarily online, but Stuff.co.nz says some people who requested paper versions of the form have not received them; while some blind New Zealanders said that they have experienced real difficulties completing the forms. The opposition New Zealand National Party says that a lack of disabled access to the forms means that \"it\u0027s likely the results will be skewed, because so many people from this sector of society won\u0027t be represented\". It\u0027s a concern echoed among the country\u0027s indigenous population, with Maori Television saying that \"Kaumatua (Maori elders), the disabled and youth seem to be particularly at risk of being left out\" because they\u0027re not online, or have not received the access codes required to access the forms. With the census being a tool to help the government make decisions about future funding, there are fears that groups most in need of government assistance may not be counted accurately.

Over time, he became friends with a number of black fathers And, by immersing himself in their daily lives, he gradually gained access to intimate family moments, \"scenarios that are fleeting and often hidden from the public realm but nonetheless meaningful\". \"Few of the men I met were in traditional relationships, but they were loving, present and responsible fathers nonetheless,\" he says. By undertaking this project, Lee was able to work through some of the issues he had around his own upbringing. And it is this emotional connection to the work that he believes makes it so powerful. Father Figure: Exploring Alternate Notions of Black Fatherhood is at the Bronx Documentary Centre, New York, until 31 March 2018. ","date":1520296856000,"topics":["Photography"]}

{"hash":"7cf0a0ac092919ca57e43bc01aa28dfb","title":"What is populism, and what does the term actually mean?","author":"bbc","feed":"world","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-43301423","content":"What do Donald Trump, Jeremy Corbyn, and Rodrigo Duterte have in common? Despite their differences, each man has been labelled a populist. Populism is on the rise - especially among Europe\u0027s right, and in the US, where it helped crown Mr Trump. Italy\u0027s populist Five Star Movement and anti-immigrant League parties have emerged as two major players in the latest elections - the most recent of several such results in Europe. But there\u0027s a difference between being popular and being populist. The pure people\nIn political science, populism is the idea that society is separated into two groups at odds with one another - \"the pure people\" and \"the corrupt elite\", according to Cas Mudde, author of Populism: A Very Short Introduction. The term is often used as a kind of shorthand political insult. Britain\u0027s Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has been accused of populism over his party\u0027s slogan \"for the many, not the few\" - but that\u0027s not quite the same thing. The word \"is generally misused, especially in a European context,\" according to Benjamin Moffitt, author of The Global Rise of Populism. The true populist leader claims to represent the unified \"will of the people\". He stands in opposition to an enemy, often embodied by the current system - aiming to \"drain the swamp\" or tackle the \"liberal elite\". \"It generally attaches itself to the right in a European context… but that\u0027s not an iron rule,\" Dr Moffitt said. Rise of the Right\nPopulist parties can be anywhere on the political spectrum. In Latin America, there was Venezuela\u0027s late President Chávez. In Spain, there is the Podemos party, and in Greece the label has also been applied to Syriza. All these are on the left. But \"most successful populists today are on the right, particularly the radical right,\" Prof Mudde said. Politicians \"like Marine Le Pen in France, Viktor Orbán in Hungary, and Donald Trump in the US, combine populism with [anti-immigrant] nativism and authoritarianism,\" he added. Commentators - from Time magazine to the President of the European Commission - have been warning about the rise of right-wing populism for years. But in reality, it\u0027s nothing new. \"Political scientists have been catching on to this for the last 25-30 years,\" Dr Moffitt says - but admits \"there\u0027s been an acceleration.\" Experts point to both societal changes like multiculturalism and globalism, and more concrete crises as behind the rise of populist parties in Europe. Martin Bull, Director of the European Consortium of Political Research (ECPR), says the emergence of populist parties in Europe could be seen in the early 2000s - but they remained small for several years. The swell in support seemed to happen \"from 2008 - and particularly in 2011, when the banking crisis turned into a sovereign debt crisis\", he said. It was a rare occasion when an elite class - the wealthy bankers - could be identified as more or less directly responsible for a crisis which affected the majority of society. \u0027I am the people\u0027\nIn his book The Global Rise of Populism, Dr Moffitt argues that there are other traits associated with the typical populist leader. One is \"bad manners\", or behaving in a way that\u0027s not typical of politicians - a tactic employed by President Trump and the Philippines\u0027 President Duterte. The other, he says, is \"perpetuating a state of crisis\" - and always seeming to be on the offensive. \"A populist leader who gets into power is \u0027forced\u0027 to be in a permanent campaign to convince his people that he is not establishment - and never will be,\" according to Prof Nadia Urbinati from Columbia University. She argues that populist content is \"made of negatives\" - whether it is anti-politics, anti-intellectualism, or anti-elite. Here lies one of the populism\u0027s strengths - it is versatile. It is \"extraordinarily powerful because it can adapt to all situations,\" she said. Another common thread among populist leaders is they tend to dislike the \"complicated democratic systems\" of modern government - preferring direct democracy like referendums instead, according to Prof Bull. That also ties in to its links to authoritarianism, he argues - a lack of trust in the established system gives rise to \"strongman\" leaders. \"Ultimately, the leader makes the decision in a way that just isn\u0027t possible in traditional democracies,\" he says. That sentiment is perhaps best embodied by the late left-wing Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, who once said: \"I am not an individual - I am the people\". Such thinking \"can lead to people thinking they\u0027re infallible,\" Dr Moffitt said. \"It restructures the political space in a new and scary way\". After all, if you\u0027re not with \"the people\" - then you must be against us. That is why populist leaders are often viewed with suspicion - and why the term is often used as a type of insult for a politician who promises too much. It\u0027s what Prof Bull says is called \"irresponsible bidding\". \"In order to garner support, they\u0027re quicker than the establishment party to make offers, or to promise to change things… that on closer inspection may not turn out to be feasible,\" he said. \"You might question how good that is for democracy,\" he added.

{"hash":"4189b28f8da65f55cfc9c8883d3a4134","title":"The gum you don\u0027t mind stuck to your shoe","author":"bbc","feed":"top","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-43198104","content":"British designer Anna Bullus is on a mission to recycle chewing gum into useful objects, cleaning up our streets in the process. More than £14bn is spent on chewing gum around the world each year, but a lot of that gum will end up stuck to the ground. Gum is the second most common type of street litter after cigarette materials. In the UK, councils spend around £50m each year cleaning up the mess. But Anna had an idea. What if the sticky stuff could actually be recycled and turned into useful objects? Around 10 years ago, she began a project looking at kerbside litter. She examined random samples, looking at things like crisp packets and cigarette butts. She then tried to figure out which elements could be recycled. \"One of the litters I found was a piece of chewing gum and as a designer I was completely amazed there was nothing actually being done to recycle it,\" she said. Researching the chemistry of chewing gum, she discovered that its main ingredient, the gum base, is commonly a synthetic rubber, a type of polymer similar to plastic. Hear more\n\"It\u0027s called polyisobutylene,\" explains Anna, \"the same stuff you find in the inner tube of bicycle wheels.\" It is obtained from petrochemicals, which are refined from fossil fuels like crude oil. She realised that chewing gum, even once it has been finished with, is a versatile and potentially useful material. Collecting gum\nBut how do you persuade people to donate their gum - instead of carelessly tossing it on to the street? As part of her strategy, Anna created bright pink, bubble-shaped bins specially for disposing of gum called Gumdrop, which can be hung at head-height. These bins are themselves made of recycled chewing gum. A message next to the bins explains that any gum collected will be recycled into new objects. But would gum-chewers use them? The University of Winchester was one of the first places to sign up to use the bins. Around 8,000 people live and work on its campus and the authorities wanted to keep it clean of gum litter. It adopted a twin-pronged strategy to tackle the problem. It installed 11 of Anna\u0027s special bins and to reinforce the message that gum can be recycled if disposed of responsibly, it gave out hundreds of coffee cups made of recycled gum to first-year students. \"Students would give the cup a sniff to check it didn\u0027t smell of mint or bubble gum,\" recalls Liz Harris, the university\u0027s environmental officer. \"It\u0027s because so much of the chewing gum sold on the high street is a polymer [so it] can be used to make new products. \u0027When people get it, it\u0027s a really nice moment.\" Eighteen months later, the university noticed a drop in gum litter and is expanding the scheme. Heathrow Airport also ran a three-month trial which it said led to a \"noticeable improvement\" and saved it £6,000 in cleaning costs. Great Western Railway has installed the bins in more than 25 of its railway stations and is rolling out the scheme further. In each case, the bins did not suddenly solve the problem of gum litter, but they did seem to begin to change people\u0027s behaviour. Moulding gum\nAnother challenge for Anna was to find industrial partners willing to recycle old gum - something completely novel. She eventually persuaded a recycling plant in Worcester to get on board. It takes her bins and filters out unwanted material, like paper or sweet wrappers, before grinding it into pieces and then compounds this with other recycled plastic polymers. The proportion in the mixture varies, but Anna says each object she makes contains a minimum of 20% chewing gum. At a plastic moulding specialist in Leicester called Amber Valley, which normally makes alarm casings, Anna creates her designer objects. Here, the mixture containing the old chewing gum is put into an injection moulding machine. It is heated and then ejected as a paste, which can be moulded into new objects as it cools. \"There\u0027s no difference [from] the equivalent polypropylene material that it\u0027s based against, the processing temperatures and parameters are all identical,\" says Brett Nixon, a manager at the plant. \"When you are handling the finished product, you do take a while to adjust to the fact that this has been in somebody\u0027s mouth previously. \u0027But once you get over that fear it\u0027s easy. By recycling it and giving it another lease of life it\u0027s helping the environment, it\u0027s an absolutely fantastic idea.\" Industry response\nThe UK Parliament has considered imposing taxes on chewing gum companies if they do not do more to combat gum litter. Anna\u0027s project has been given financial support from Wrigley, one of the largest manufacturers. It also provides her with surplus material from its Plymouth factory to add to her supply. Alex Hunter-Dunn, a spokesman for Wrigley, explained why the company backs the project. \"Gumdrop is a really creative and innovative way to get people responsibly disposing of their gum and binning it. We fundamentally believe that behaviour change is the only long-term sustainable solution to tackle the issue and we are very much behind that.\" Other approaches are being tried to beat the scourge of gum litter. Researchers have worked on a synthetic chewing gum that is biodegradable and will wash off the streets more easily, which is also the case with an organic chewing gum, made from Chicle gum native to Central America, which has a small market. But in the current market, dominated by synthetic, non-biodegradable gum, Anna thinks her method is the best option on the table. \"I do believe that through right design, \" she says, \"we can actually change the way people behave.\" Follow Dougal Shaw on Twitter @dougalshawbbc You can learn more about recycling chewing gum in the latest People Fixing the World podcastfrom the BBC World Service ","date":1520296781000,"topics":["University of Winchester","Recycling","World Hacks"]}

The Daily Mail says he may have been the target of a \"revenge hit\" by former Russian colleagues. He is said to have recently told police he feared for his life. Sources tell the Times nothing is being ruled out - including the illicit administering of \"something very sinister\". The Daily Telegraph says an unknown substance was removed from the scene, wrapped in protective layers. Wiltshire Police say they are investigating whether a crime has been committed. But Garry Kasparov - the former world chess champion and a prominent critic of President Putin - tells the paper: \"After the UK\u0027s pathetic response to the assassination of Alexander Litvinenko - why wouldn\u0027t Putin do it again?\" \"Another scandal with a Russophobic tinge is brewing\" is how the story is introduced by the Moscow daily Komsomolskaya Pravda. It suggests UK intelligence services may be involved in the incident in order apparently to discredit Russia and prevent the normalisation of relations with Britain. The website of the Russian broadcaster RT says the British media are \"rushing\" to compare the incident with the death of the former Russian security officer Alexander Litvinenko from radiation poisoning in 2006. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning Sir Bradley Wiggins is the focus of a story in the Times which identifies him as an investor in a tax avoidance scheme that has been described as \"notorious\" and \"shocking\" by MPs. The Cup Trust, which was closed down last year, used a charity as a front to avoid tens of millions of pounds in tax. The arrangement is not illegal and a spokesman for Sir Bradley tells the Times he has paid all his due taxes and has no open inquiries with HMRC. The Financial Times leads with a claim that transatlantic routes operated by British airlines are at risk, after negotiations with the US for a post-Brexit flights deal got off to a tough start. The current arrangement stems from the UK\u0027s membership of the European Union. The sticking point is said to be US rules about foreign ownership as British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have large overseas shareholdings.

It is \"on the table\", Cabinet Chief Marcos Peña said. Meanwhile a bill put forward on Tuesday would allow women to terminate pregnancies during the first 14 weeks. President Mauricio Macri said he was personally opposed to relaxing the country\u0027s abortion laws, but he would give his Congress allies a free vote. Abortion is a controversial issue in the predominantly Catholic nation. It is only allowed in cases of rape, when the mother\u0027s life is deemed to be at risk, or when there is a severe malformation of the foetus. Women seeking abortions must apply to a judge for permission, which critics say can unnecessarily delay the procedure. More than 70 Argentine members of Congress put forward a bill during a ceremony attended by dozens of activists. At the bill\u0027s presentation in Buenos Aires, opposition MP Aracelia Ferreyra said reform of the Argentine abortion law was \"a topic of equality and inequality\". In several Latin American countries, abortion is illegal in any circumstance. In August 2017, Chile\u0027s constitutional court approved a bill to ease the country\u0027s total ban on abortions. Abortions are illegal in Brazil, except in health emergencies or cases of rape or, since 2012, in cases of anencephaly, where the foetus\u0027s brain fails to grow. Uruguay, which borders Argentina, permits abortions. Several Roman Catholic countries, including Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Malta, The Vatican and Dominican Republic, have an abortion ban in all circumstances. Ireland, a traditionally Roman Catholic country, will hold a referendum on whether to reform the country\u0027s near-total ban on abortion in May 2018.

The term is used to refer to pressure on water resources which causes problems like shortages. Officials and experts admit the growth of the city has put pressure on its water resources, particularly because in the last few years alone more than 100 villages have been absorbed into this rapidly expanding metropolis, known as India\u0027s Silicon Valley. In 2012, nine million people lived in Bangalore. Now, there are 11 million. Government officials say shortage of water is a very real problem, particularly in the peripheral areas of the city which are already dependant on tankers for drinking water supply. These tankers get their supply from borewells, but as demand increases they are being forced to dig deeper and deeper to find water. The Bangalore water supply and sewerage board ( BWSSB), the agency that provides drinking water and manages the city\u0027s sewage system, acknowledges that in 2014, a survey predicted Bangalore was on the verge of running out of water. But, they say the situation has changed since then - one critical government decision just may have staved off complete disaster, at least for now. In 2013, the government decided to divert an additional 10 thousand million cubic feet of water from the Cauvery river to Bangalore for its drinking water needs. The Cauvery is the principal source of water for not just the city, but also for the irrigation needs of much of Karnataka state where Bangalore is located. And Cauvery water is precious. The state has been involved for more than a century in a dispute over sharing water resources from the river with neighbouring Tamil Nadu state. The Supreme Court has had to intervene on multiple occasions, but has also permitted states to prioritise the use of water for drinking purposes. \"The current supply of water to Bangalore amounts to about 100 litres of water per person per day,\" Tushar Girinath, chairman of the water supply board, told the BBC. Officials estimate that by diverting the river water, the city will gain a little more than 50% of its current supply. The project, called \"Cauvery Water Supply Stage Five\", is funded by the Japanese International Cooperation Agency. The additional supply is expected to help Bangalore provide drinking water to a 225 sq km (87 sq-mile) area that is currently dependent upon water supplied via borewells and tankers. In addition to the additional supply from the Cauvery, the city will in the next 18 months also receive water from another river called the Nethravati. Mr Girinath said this would make the water position of the city more \"comfortable\". \"Yes, we will face some water stress until 2023. But we certainly are not facing a crisis, because we are augmenting the supply,\" he said. Officials say the plan has taken the rapid growth of the city into account. Merely increasing supply will not be enough to ensure Bangalore has adequate water supply though. The city\u0027s residents also need to participate in conservation and harvesting efforts. But this has not been the case so far. The water board has run massive campaigns promoting rainwater harvesting in an effort to help replenish ground water supplies. But this has got a disappointing response. It is mandatory for people to construct rainwater harvesting facilities at their homes, but this is often ignored. The board in fact, collects a sum of more than 20m rupees (about $300,000; £222,000) in fines every month from people who have not complied. \"Bangalore\u0027s annual rainfall alone could give the city 2,740 million litres of water a day,\" Vishwanath Srikantaiah, a water expert, told the BBC. Mr Girinath adds that people will also have to begin recycling water using their own sewage treatment plants. \"They will also have to understand that the board cannot provide treated water. Our sewage treatment plants are so huge that we have set them up outside the city. So, we expect people living in complexes housing 50 or more apartments to construct smaller plants to treat water for their own needs,\" he said. A sewage treatment plant small enough to be used by an apartment costs around 750,000 rupees to install. People living in smaller houses or slums will get free treated water from the water board. \"Of the 100 litres used by every person per day, people need only 20 litres for cooking, drinking water and bathing purposes. The remaining 80 litres is used for non-potable purposes like flushing toilets, cleaning floors and washing cars,\u0027\u0027 BN Tyagaraja, who headed an expert panel to look for additional water sources, told the BBC. \"The citizens have to realise that water is a scarce commodity. Not just in Bangalore but across the world. We need to conserve water,\" he said. Mr Srikantaiah agrees. \"Bangalore is not likely to run out of water but we will have to manage it well,\" he says.

{"hash":"bf2bfcb13e88c7bab097de3fa837c5a7","title":"WeChat hits one billion monthly users - are you one of them?","author":"bbc","feed":"world","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43283690","content":"WeChat has hit one billion monthly users for the first time, the owner of the Chinese messaging app has revealed. The vast majority of its users are based in China, where it\u0027s known as Weixin, and where the recent Lunar New Year boosted it past the milestone. But it is still lagging behind Facebook-owned WhatsApp which has about 1.5 billion monthly users. WeChat is the jewel in the crown of Chinese tech giant Tencent. But why is it so popular? Here are five reasons it has done so well. It\u0027s not just about messaging\nSure, it began as a messaging app. And it does at first glance look and feel a bit like WhatsApp and Viber. But WeChat evolved quickly, and it lets users do much more than just communicate with their friends and family. It serves as China\u0027s biggest social network. But it\u0027s also where people turn to book a taxi, order food, make a doctors appointment, do their banking, or find a date. And when they are playing games like the huge Tencent-owned hit Honour of Kings, WeChat is where players compare scores with their friends. It has become integral to the daily life of many in China, especially in the cities. It is quite possible to get through an entire day using the app for (pretty much) your every need, which means it\u0027s only going to grow. It makes paying for things simple\nThe growth of digital payments in China means many younger people have skipped the credit card concept for paying online. Instead they use payments services run by local tech giants like Alibaba or Tencent. WeChat\u0027s payments feature lets users upload their banking details and then can buy products or services from any official account. Even taking a small percentage from each transaction makes WeChat in one of Tencent\u0027s best-earners. You might also be interested in:\nCorporations love it\nWeChat has let millions of businesses get into the smartphones of customers and would-be customers. Companies and organisations can create official accounts within WeChat - a little like apps. Some do this before they even set up an app of their own. Users can subscribe to the accounts and get promotions messaged directly to them or click in be taken to a shopping page,. And the payment system already mentioned means if firms can persuade a user to part with some cash, the process of making that transaction is pretty straight forward. And WeChat is a big reason QR Codes have been adopted so readily in China - technology that helps firms get information to users as well as facilitate those payments. Also, while WeChat has been fairly conservative in the amount of advertising it allows on its platform, it is a very targeted way for corporations to reach people. It is unashamedly China-focussed\nWhile it is making in-roads in South East Asia and South Africa, WeChat really is still all about China. It understands that market, and taps into what Chinese users are doing both online and offline. For example, the giving of red envelopes containing money at Lunar New Year - the country\u0027s biggest annual holiday - is a huge tradition. A few years back WeChat introduced digital versions of these \"hongbao\" and its popularity has soared. During the festival which just ended, more than 688 million WeChat users sent or received them. The Great Firewall doesn\u0027t apply\nRestrictions on access to many Western social media services such as Facebook and Twitter - as well as Google - meant most Chinese people do not have access to these services legally, even if they wanted them And that created an environment where local players like WeChat could thrive. So too did QQ - another Tencent-owned platform which migrated its users over to WeChat, another boost to its user base. All Chinese social media platforms are required to censor public posts deemed illegal by the government. WeChat is no different. But it insists encryption means others can\u0027t \"snoop\" on your messages - and that content such as text, audio and images are not stored on its servers - and are deleted once all intended recipients have read them. Earlier this year it issued a statement denying \"storing chat histories\" after criticism from Chinese businessman Li Shufu, who recently said the firm \"must be watching all our WeChats every day\". The Tencent-owned firm said suggestions that it was watching users was \"pure misunderstanding\". ","date":1520297356000,"topics":["China","Tencent","Social media"]}

{"hash":"9583f7e13c89e36aaa984bbdca825bc3","title":"How to charge up your electric car in 10 minutes","author":"bbc","feed":"world","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43285885","content":"Imagine being able to charge your electric car in minutes rather than hours, or your smartphone in seconds. That\u0027s the enticing prospect being touted by researchers who reckon they\u0027ve discovered a new material that could boost the performance of a carbon-based supercapacitor - sometimes called an ultracapacitor - a type of energy storage device that can be charged very quickly and offload its power very quickly, too. Dr Donald Highgate, director of research at Superdielectrics Ltd, says a material he originally developed for soft contact lenses is also surprisingly good at holding an electrostatic field. Very simply, supercapacitors don\u0027t produce electricity through chemical reactions as conventional batteries do, they create these electrostatic fields. Dr Highgate is working with Bristol and Surrey universities to develop supercapacitors using the new polymer and hopes that they could eventually rival, or even surpass, lithium-ion (li-ion) batteries - so long as they manage to replicate prototype performance on a large scale. So far, supercapacitors have been good at providing quick bursts of power - to start a car engine, for example, or to give trains a boost when accelerating. They\u0027re also well-suited to harvesting energy from vehicles when they brake, making them an important component in electric vehicles. And national electricity grids use them to provide quick power top-ups when balancing supply and demand. South Korea\u0027s capital Seoul is hoping to have 3,500 supercapacitor-powered buses operating by 2020, and they\u0027re also being used in Shanghai, China. European car maker PSA Peugeot Citroen has been using them in its cars since 2010 - supercapacitor maker Maxwell Technologies says more than a million vehicles now incorporate its products. But to date, supercapacitors haven\u0027t been very good at holding much power or holding on to that power for very long. This poor energy density, as it\u0027s called, the amount of power they can hold per kilogramme, has put them at a significant disadvantage to li-ion batteries. More Technology of Business\n\"The two main advantages of conventional supercapacitors over batteries are their ability to handle much higher charge and discharge rates, and their longer cycle life,\" says Gareth Hinds, Fellow of the UK\u0027s National Physical Laboratory. \"The downside is that they tend to be relatively high cost and can only store a few seconds-, or at most, minutes-worth of power.\" This isn\u0027t a problem when your supercapacitor is being used to power a tool on a factory assembly line, for example. It can be recharged in seconds once it\u0027s placed back in its charging dock. But it is if you\u0027re in an electric car or bus that needs recharging every few miles. Taavi Madiberk, chief executive and co-founder of Skeleton Technologies, a supercapacitor maker based in Estonia, Germany and Finland, says his products incorporate layers of graphene - a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice - and other carbon-based materials in its supercapacitors. These layers have a huge surface area - just 1g of graphene can cover 2,000 sq m, says Mr Madiberk. This allows them to hold on to a lot more power. His firm\u0027s products are already used in hybrid vehicles, particularly buses and lorries. In one experiment, they installed supercapacitors in a Sainsbury\u0027s supermarket diesel-electric delivery van and \"achieved 32% fuel savings\", says Mr Madiberk. But he acknowledges that in the short-term, combining supercapacitors with li-ion batteries is probably the best way to enjoy the best of both worlds, particularly in electric vehicles. Ulrik Grape, chief executive of NaWa technologies, another supercapacitor maker based in the South of France, agrees, saying: \"Supercapacitors don\u0027t store as much energy but their response is instantaneous. So a supercapacitor could handle acceleration and energy recovery under braking - taking care of the stressful part of a battery\u0027s life - possibly doubling or tripling a battery\u0027s life expectancy.\" NaWa\u0027s technology involves electrodes made from \"vertically aligned carbon and graphene nanotubes that can store the energy on the surface of these tubes,\" explains Mr Grape. These tubes, which are coated with another carbon-based material, are so tiny you can fit 10 billion of them in a square centimetre. As carbon is a light material, incorporating supercapacitors into li-ion batteries would also reduce the overall weight, and this would improve the range performance of an electric vehicle. A Formula E racing car\u0027s battery, currently made by Williams Advanced Engineering, weighs 300kg, but this could be reduced by a third to 200kg, NaWa believes, without any loss of range. \"We think the ability to charge and discharge a battery fast will be one of the most important things in the future,\" says Mr Grape. \"We don\u0027t have as much energy as a lithium-ion battery but we can do many more cycles - charges and discharges - up to a million. Carbon is such a robust material.\" By contrast, a normal battery, which relies on chemical reactions to create electricity, eventually wears out once those chemicals lose their potency - after about 3,000 to 5,000 cycles of charging and discharging. Another advantage of supercapacitors, makers say, is that they don\u0027t require rare materials, such as cobalt. Of course, supercapacitors don\u0027t mean the end of traditional batteries by any means. Li-ion technology is still being improved by about 5-10% each year. New forms of energy storage will be critical to the success of renewable energy as a replacement for fossil fuels. When the sun doesn\u0027t shine or the wind doesn\u0027t blow, we\u0027ll need to access stored energy very quickly to plug the gap. As well as traditional energy storage methods, such as pumped hydro, flywheels, compressed gas and large battery arrays, highly efficient supercapacitors could eventually become a crucial component in a fully sustainable energy network. But these are early days. \"Polymer-based supercapacitors are emerging as a promising technology,\" concludes Gareth Hinds, \"but there is a lot of work still to do to achieve the required energy storage capacity without compromising on power, lifetime and cost.\" ","date":1520295329000,"topics":["Renewable energy"]}

{"hash":"5ac6f96a520676934490c9b2ceb175a1","title":"The story of women\u0027s football in 10 objects","author":"bbc","feed":"world","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43139535","content":"A hundred years ago, teams of women were playing in front of large crowds and making big money. Then the Football Association banned them from its grounds. Here\u0027s the story of the fall and rise of women\u0027s football, told through 10 objects collected by the National Football Museum. \"Complaints having been made as to football being played by women, the [FA] council feel impelled to express their strong opinion that the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and ought not to be encouraged. Complaints have also been made as to the conditions under which some of these matches have been arranged and played, and the appropriation of receipts to other than charitable objects.\" With these words in 1921, the FA decided to ban the playing of women\u0027s football in FA-member grounds, which strangled the game as a successful business as the stricture remained in place for 50 years. In other countries there were outright bans on women playing. Jean Williams, the University of Wolverhampton\u0027s professor of sport, takes us through items which show the business history and struggles of the women\u0027s game. 1. 1895 Sketch magazine print of Nettie Honeyball \u0027in her football costume\u0027\n\"In 1863 we get the formation of the Football Association and of the modern game. The first women\u0027s football games that we know about are in 1881, and they are professional games played to large audiences and they make money. It seems they are organised by local businessmen. The 1881-82 games are relatively short lived. \"Nettie Honeyball is the secretary and captain of the first British Ladies Football Club, which was founded in 1894. She was a middle class woman, and they had a non-playing president Lady Florence Dixie, who was upper class. \"In historic terms this was the first time women organised football for women. The first game was in Crouch End in 1895 before 10,000 people, which must have generated healthy receipts. Hundreds of games follow in the next few years and the women\u0027s game is played all over Britain.\" 2. Wheaties cereal box from the 1990s featuring US player Michelle Akers\n\"In the 1991 women\u0027s world championship she was the winner of the golden boot. She was the first real international women\u0027s football star and was massive in the US. She paved the way for Mia Hamm and Hope Solo, but interestingly one of the things that constricted her potential success was that she suffered from chronic fatigue disorder. But for that, her international profile could have been much more. \"The narrative of the Wheaties box is that she has had challenges to overcome but is still achieving and can\u0027t be held back. This is all referred to on the packaging of the cereal, which the manufacturers call \u0027The Breakfast of Champions\u0027. \"It is one of the first commercial endorsements of this type in the 1990s, at a time when Fifa finally decided they were going to actively oversee women\u0027s football, having taken over its stewardship in 1971 but not doing much to promote it in the intervening years.\" 3. Programmes from 1950s women\u0027s football matches\n\"The crux of the FA\u0027s ban is that it does not ban women\u0027s football outright, but stops it being played on member clubs\u0027 grounds. Before the ban women\u0027s football is an entertainment spectacle, and if you play it in enclosed stadiums then you can charge people money to come in and watch. \"Once the ban comes in women\u0027s football goes to other venues: to rugby league and cricket grounds, as well as other venues. These programmes show games being played at Belle Vue speedway stadium, Manchester, and at a general sports stadium on the Isle of Man. \"But the FA puts pressure on other sports not to host women\u0027s games, which destroys the business model of the women\u0027s game. And that gives growth to the myth that women\u0027s football has never been an entertaining commercial spectacle. The game is still finding its way back from the ban.\" 4. Christie and Barbie football dolls\n\"These dolls were released for sale before the 1999 Women\u0027s World Cup by toymaker Mattel. The goalkeeper of that team was Briana Scurry.\" [The first woman goalkeeper and first black woman to be elected to the US National Soccer Hall of Fame.] \"But more generally, it reflects [the fact] that the American consumer market was sensitive and aware of questions of ethnicity and race. The marketing of the dolls was as diverse and inclusive as it could be. \"There was obviously already an established business around the Barbie and Christie brands, but such was the growing marketing power of women\u0027s football that a major manufacturer thought it could cash in further around the 1999 World Cup.\" 5. Shirt from Eniola Aluko\u0027s debut, England v Netherlands, 2004\n\"The business significance is that major manufacturer Umbro produced the shirt. Historically, sporting brands have not created consumer markets in women\u0027s football replica wear in the same way that they have done in other sports, particularly the high-fashion ones of tennis and golf. \"It is only relatively recently that that sporting brands have released football shirts cut for women, or boots specifically made for female feet. However, while these other aspects of women\u0027s football shirts have progressed, what is interesting is that often the shirt sponsors within the game are not of such \u0027high brand value\u0027 as the men\u0027s game. \"There is a real opportunity out there for brands such as cosmetics firms to sponsor women\u0027s football teams, but you get brands like Nivea preferring to partner with the Liverpool men\u0027s football team.\" 6. A ticket from the 1991 Women\u0027s World Championship with sponsor\n\"This ticket, being sponsored by M\u0026Ms, shows that a major US confectionery brand was using women\u0027s football to try and crack the potential new business market of China. The tournament was played for the M\u0026Ms Cup. Meanwhile, China wanted to establish a commercial relationship with the West. \"There were seven sponsors of this first official women\u0027s global tournament in 1991, which Fifa interestingly, and tentatively, called a \u0027world championship\u0027 and not a World Cup. Fifa wanted to get into China and China wanted to join the world football family, so to test the waters this low-financial-risk event was drawn up. \"The event was a sporting success and also a successful media product, it was sold to TV companies around the world, and it showed full stadia for the women\u0027s game.\" 7. Ball and boots of the type worn by 1920s/30s star Lily Parr\n\"Lily Parr was the star of the Dick, Kerr Ladies football team of Preston. She began playing for the team at 14, and played for them for 20 years. There are various reports of Lily receiving \u0027broken time payments\u0027, that is, financial compensation for amateur players for time they had had to take off from their day jobs. These women players were nurses, munitions workers, and so on. \"These payments, with her earnings from nursing, enabled her to become the first person in her family to own their own home. Obviously this all relates to the ban of 1921 as the FA decides too much of the charitable funds from women\u0027s matches are being used for player expenses. They were meant to be amateurs but the financial arrangements could be described as at best opaque. \"The boots and ball are from her era. She was a left winger, then moved back into defence and ended her career in goal.\" 8. Poster for an unofficial Women\u0027s World Cup in 1970\n\"There were two unofficial Women\u0027s World Cups held in the early 1970s: one in Italy in 1970 and one in Mexico a year later, both backed by local business interests and played in major football stadiums. \"In Mexico the event definitely looked to piggyback the men\u0027s World Cup held in the country the previous year. That would explain the commercialisation of the women\u0027s event there, which was considerable, with key rings, badges, programmes and other consumables produced, and a lot of coverage in the local press. The final was played in the Azteca Stadium in front of 110,000. \"The Italian event was sponsored by Italian multinational drinks brand Martini \u0026 Rossi, and its final was held in the Turin\u0027s Stadio Communale in front of 40,000.\" [Denmark defeated the host nations in both finals]. 9. Postcard of Dick, Kerr Ladies FC (1920s)\n\"Dick, Kerr wanted to be known as the best in the world, but also wanted to plug into the success of the local men\u0027s team and the civic notion of Proud Preston. They had a regular paying public who supported them financially at weekends but also at pioneering floodlit matches. \"Most of the crowds at their games are local working-class men. When we think we are being progressive by following women\u0027s football, it was these men who were coming out to support the team week in, week out. \"This commercially-produced postcard is evidence of \u0027ambient marketing\u0027, typical of how the team\u0027s fame spread beyond their home town to a much wider audience. Newsreel films and magazine articles will also have spread their name further afield.\" 10. Art deco statuette of a female footballer\n\"Because women\u0027s football has always been topical, representing modernity, assertive female physicality, and - in its early days - played solely to raise large sums of money, its broader representation has always been culturally significant. \"So artefacts, collectables, disposable items, ephemera, have been created around the game over the decades. This statuette is an example of a stylised female football player that someone would have had in their home. It is 1920s in appearance. \"There were a lot of similar models made around women\u0027s boxing and athletics; beautified art deco creations.\" Professor Williams has organised Upfront and Onside: The Women\u0027s Football Conference, about the history and heritage of women\u0027s football to be held at the National Football Museum in Manchester on International Women\u0027s Day, 8 March, and the following day.

{"hash":"074d5742be3d80bbd3ffd4f4fb7f4822","title":"Oscars 2018: Four things to take away from this year\u0027s awards","author":"bbc","feed":"world","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-43286005","content":"This year\u0027s Oscar ceremony won\u0027t go down in history as one of the most surprising ever - perhaps a good thing after last year\u0027s best picture mix-up. Most of the people who were expected to win awards won them, while the awards were evenly distributed between the main films in contention. And despite references to #MeToo and Harvey Weinstein, it didn\u0027t feel as political as the Golden Globes with its red carpet black-out. Yet there were themes that ran through the ceremony, repeated by different winners in different categories. Here are the four main threads: 1. Persistence pays off\nSome people get Oscars for their first film. But for some, it takes longer - quite a bit longer, in fact. On Sunday we saw James Ivory win his very first Oscar, for adapted screenplay, for the gorgeous yet heartbreaking coming-of-age romance Call Me By Your Name. At 89, he\u0027s the oldest person to ever take home one of the coveted gold statues - and it sounds like it was worth the wait. He told the press room: \"I mean, being 90 years for anything that you would do is extraordinary. \"But to be here having won the Oscar at that age, this seems like a hiccup in nature. But it feels great.\" Then we had British cinematographer Roger Deakins, finally winning an Oscar after being nominated a stonking 14 times. In the end, it was his work on Blade Runner 2049 that earned him the award. It was actually Allison Janney\u0027s first Oscars, and her first win - something she once thought was simply not going to happen for her. \"I didn\u0027t dare to dream of things like this, because I didn\u0027t want to be disappointed,\" she said. \"At a certain point, I\u0027d given up on something like this happening to me.\" And while Jordan Peele won the Oscar for best original screenplay for Get Out, he had quit writing it 20 times. Yes, 20 times. But he persevered. The message there? Don\u0027t give up and dare to dream. 2. The future looks bright\nThis year\u0027s Oscars may have been devoid of the drama that categorised last year - possibly thanks to a larger font being used on the envelopes. Neither was it a politically-charged year for the Academy Awards, with no #OscarsSoWhite this time around. But it did feel like there was a change in the air: a sense of new kinds of films being recognised, made by people who might have previously been passed over by the Oscars. That\u0027s quite likely due to the change in the make-up of the voting Academy in recent years. Jordan Peele put it well by saying there was a \"renaissance\" in film. It was like a baton was being passed too, when Gary Oldman paid tribute to the skills of fellow best actor nominee Timothee Chalamet - telling the young actor he\u0027d be back and that his time for an Oscar would come. Meanwhile, The Shape of Water director Guillermo del Toro offered a challenge to aspiring film-makers. \"I want to tell you - everyone who is dreaming of… using genre or fantasy to tell stories about the things that are real in the world today, you can do it,\" he said as he picked up the award for best picture. \"This is a door - kick it open and come in.\" 3. \u0027Representation matters\u0027\nThat line came from the inspiring speech given by Lee Unkrich, producer of Disney/Pixar\u0027s charming Day of the Dead animation Coco. He said his biggest thanks went to Mexico, and that the film could not have existed without its \"endlessly beautiful culture and traditions\". \"With Coco, we tried to take a step forward toward a world where all children can grow up seeing characters in movies that look and talk and live like they do,\" he told the audience. \"Marginalised people deserve to feel like they belong. Representation matters.\" It was an Oscars where representation seemed to matter, more than perhaps ever before. It was on stage in the form of Daniela Vega, the first transgender actress to present. (The film she stars in, A Fantastic Woman, also won best foreign film.) And it was present when del Toro won best director and best picture. Frances McDormand made a point of forcing the Oscars to stare representation in the face by asking female nominees to stand up. And Rachel Shenton and Chris Overton spoke of the importance of their short film, The Silent Child, in representing deafness. There\u0027s still a long way to go, with only one woman having won a best director Oscar - an award that\u0027s yet to go to a black director. But it feels like a start. 4. Snacks are key...\nIt might seem like the stuff of dreams - or of nightmares, depending on how you feel about hot dogs. But giant plastic hot dog cannons that you fire actual hot dogs out of are real, they exist, and they formed a key part of a skit during the Oscars show. Jimmy Kimmel got celebrities including Gal Gadot, Margot Robbie and Emily Blunt to take a quick trip across the road to a nearby cinema, where an unsuspecting audience were watching a preview of A Wrinkle in Time. There they provided snacks to the surprised members of the public. But the highlight was surely Armie Hammer and Ansel Elgort armed with hot dog cannons. \"This is better than the Oscars!\" Gadot exclaimed.

The prime minister stood surrounded by fake bricks as she told young people they\u0027re \"right to be angry\" at not being able to buy a home. People on social media couldn\u0027t get over the set though, suggesting Mrs May looked like she was climbing out of a chimney or in a Mario video game. The PM used her speech to criticise property developers. Mrs May, who said home ownership was largely unaffordable to those not backed by \"the bank of mum and dad\", was speaking at the National Planning Conference. But for some people the backdrop reminded them of somewhere else entirely. *mario sfx* boop-booop-booop-boop pic.twitter.com/p3ELF4Pa4Z End of Twitter post by @MarkDiStef And they quickly got busy on Photoshop.

And it didn\u0027t pass him by when the Conservatives tweeted during the speech. It\u0027s not the first time a speech by the prime minister has been overshadowed by what\u0027s going on behind her. At the Conservative Party conference in 2017, her backdrop began to fall apart as she was speaking. This speech saw Mrs May point her finger at developers, who she said have a \"perverse\" financial incentive to hoard land once it had been approved for development rather than actually build on it. \"I want to see planning permissions going to people who are actually going to build houses, not just sit on land and watch its value rise,\" she said. \"I expect developers to do their duty to Britain and build the homes our country needs.\" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

{"hash":"a6ec8d27e039ddd22b7dddb6cac1f20b","title":"Virgin islanders still in shelter, six months after Irma","author":"bbc","feed":"top","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43303537","content":"Six months after the worst hurricane in living memory brought devastation to the Caribbean, there are still UK citizens sleeping in a government shelter with nowhere to call home. In the middle of a basketball gymnasium, Stanton \"Mikey\" Robinson, 30, sat with all of his worldly possessions. Fighting back tears he explained his dream of having a small apartment with a small table and a single bed. \"I don\u0027t like it in here. I don\u0027t feel comfortable in this place,\" he told us. \"(tell the government to) Please help me.\" Twenty metres away on what\u0027s meant to be spectator seating, Makeba Hesky, 34, sat nursing her 10-month-old child. A large hole - unpatched since the hurricane - in the roof of the BVI Sports Complex allowed rain and light to pour into the otherwise unlit gymnasium. \"It seems to me like everybody just give up on us,\" Hesky said. Hesky and Robinson are among the approximately 20 people still living in the shelter who have faced repeated deadlines to move out despite nowhere to go. Many more are living with friends and family. Outside the sports complex and across the islands, signs of Irma\u0027s (destructive) visit can still be seen everywhere - not least at the island\u0027s government building. Most of the structure\u0027s windows are boarded, awaiting replacement. Inside, the island\u0027s premier, Orlando Smith, works from a sparse office while repairmen are still labouring to repair the extensive damage. Asked if he could guarantee that those in the shelter would not be thrown out with nowhere to go, Smith told the BBC, \"that\u0027s why they\u0027re still there… we\u0027re looking to provide the necessary accommodation for them\". The \"biggest priority is housing - getting those roofs back on, getting people in homes,\" he said, speaking outside his office. \"Then of course, there is the matter of the economy. We\u0027ve got to get that economy back up and running.\" Economically speaking, the islands\u0027 tourism sector took the biggest hit. Few know that better than Roselyn Hill. She like many others here worked in the tourism industry for decades, only to be laid off when Irma damaged the resorts and attractions at which they worked. \"Peak season a couple of years ago - sometimes it looks like more boats than water. You can\u0027t see the water for the yachts,\" she said, standing on a cruise ship dock that (now lies) laid empty. Two of the biggest cruise companies have stopped bringing ships to the BVI, and the reduced numbers of tourists has meant a slow recovery for the tourism industry. \"It\u0027s not a good feeling you know back then to compare it to now,\" she said. \"When we see a cruise ship, it\u0027s like light\". The hardships have caused many to question whether the United Kingdom did enough to support those on the islands. Across town, Rita Plunkett was doing her washing on a day off. Stepping inside, she explained how windows and doors to her home were broken during the storm and pointed to massive water damage to a bedroom ceiling. On the roof of her apartment building, bits of UK Aid-branded tarpaulin stood between her and regular rainstorms. She said the UK\u0027s response came up short. She received, \"no aid, apart from the six bottles of water I got - that was it,\" she said. It was a common perception we have heard here over the past few days - that other than the work done by British troops in the month after the storm, more could have been done. Upon returning from a preaching trip to the island of Virgin Gorda, Bishop John Cline went a step further than most we spoke with. \"When we did need them to show that we are truly a child of the United Kingdom, I think they disappointed us,\" he said. \"It changed our view in terms of a relationship, to saying \u0027are we really a part of you or is that just in name only?\u0027\" But the island\u0027s British governor, Gus Jaspert, says he\u0027s proud of the UK\u0027s contribution to the BVI\u0027s recovery - noting that much of Britain\u0027s work has been behind-the-scenes. \"(Together) we\u0027ve got the electricity back on. We\u0027ve got businesses back open. We\u0027ve got all children getting educated, and key services are back up and running,\" he said, noting that much work still remained. The governor is right about progress being made. Given the scale of the destruction even removing debris has been a huge feat, albeit one that is still ongoing. The island\u0027s main high school lies in ruin. Many other schools appear damaged. Harbours are littered with overturned and abandoned boats - some boats lay where they washed up on land. Roads are littered with potholes. And some debris remains strewn about. And now, with hurricane season less than 100 days away, many island residents are worried about what the next storm may bring.

{"hash":"08bdbb31f50a6320672fd38edb60c28b","title":"\u0027I was raped as a student - and I’m not the only one\u0027","author":"bbc","feed":"top","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-43258170","content":"When Hannah Price was sexually assaulted as a student, she felt unable to report it. She has since discovered she is far from alone - and that sexual assault may be far more common on campus than official figures suggest. I don\u0027t remember being taught about consent at school, other than \"No means no.\" What I do remember is being told not to walk home on my own, or I\u0027d risk being raped by a stranger in a dark alley. But when I was raped it was not in the street, but in my own student house, and I had taken the precaution of being walked home by someone I knew. It was the first social event of that academic year at the University of Bristol and it had been a fun night. It was everyone\u0027s favourite time of term - lectures had not properly begun and deadlines were still far from our minds. I drank, laughed and danced until I was ready for sleep. As I was leaving the club, a guy also at the social said he lived near me and offered to walk me home. Walking home alone, late at night, in the dark was something I actively tried to avoid, so I gladly accepted his offer. We\u0027d only met a few weeks before, so conversation was light - we chatted about the night and what to expect in the new term. When we got to the steps that led up to my house, he politely asked if he could pop inside for a glass of water because he was feeling unwell. Maybe this is when I should have heard alarm bells, but even as I was pouring the drink in my kitchen nothing struck me as amiss. Not until after he\u0027d finished the water, and the pretence was over. With his first demand to go to my room, came my first rebuff - my first spoken \"No.\" To this day, it still strikes me how a charming disguise can so quickly disperse, and turn into aggression. Despite my refusal to go to my bedroom, and my repeated attempts to get him to leave, he was relentless: \"Why would you let me in if you didn\u0027t want something to happen?\" The more I said I wasn\u0027t interested, the more forceful he became. I lost count of how many times I said \"No\". And then suddenly there was someone physically stronger than me, refusing to leave until he got what he wanted. His hand grabbed my arm so fiercely that it became instantly clear that his intentions had never been to get me home safely. It is a strange feeling, being so paralysed by fear in your own living room. In that moment, I realised saying \"No\" wasn\u0027t going to be enough. He took off my tights. When he was done he finally left. The next day I locked myself in my room, only leaving to shower away the reminders of the night before. I lay there overwhelmed with disgust, self-blame and guilt. You may also be interested in:\nI never reported what happened to anyone in authority. Who would believe me if I did? I had been drinking. I let him into my house. I didn\u0027t physically try to fight him off - fear took over. Surely that meant it was my fault? What happened didn\u0027t fit any label that I recognised: he wasn\u0027t a stranger, there was no dark alley. I knew I would have to see him again. I was in a student bubble, studying and socialising with my peers - even at an institution as big as my university was, bumping into someone is inevitable. And because of his charismatic public persona and popularity it seemed easier, and less traumatic, to suppress what had happened, than face up to it. This was my first time living independently. There was no-one I felt I could turn to at the university. I worried that what happened wasn\u0027t \"serious enough\" to be believed or taken seriously. The university\u0027s policy stated that if you were reporting what was a criminal offence they couldn\u0027t and wouldn\u0027t do anything until it had been dealt with by the police. But I was wary of going to the police. The year before, I had reported another student to the police for attacking me in a nightclub. There were witnesses and CCTV evidence - nevertheless, the fallout was hugely stressful. I was alienated from some of my friends. I had to deal with the anxiety about running into that student on a daily basis - my mental and physical health quickly declined. Multiply that by 100 and that is what I imagined reporting my sexual assault to the police would be like. Help and advice\nThe process for sexual assault can take ages. How would my studies be affected by a serious criminal investigation and trial? The likelihood of bumping into my perpetrator wouldn\u0027t reduce over that time, so would I even be safe? There would also be the embarrassment and fear of being shamed and the added doubt that our mutual friends might not even believe me, and accuse me of ruining someone\u0027s life. So I told no-one, I saw him all the time and forced myself to pretend that it was nothing. But every now and then there would be glimpses to remind me of what happened - moments where he would stand a little too close or persistently message me late at night. That night was over three years ago. Yet, it wasn\u0027t until this summer, when I was done with my degree and had left university that I was able to acknowledge to myself, and others, that I was raped. And I\u0027m not alone. What\u0027s shocking is how many other stories there are like mine. As a student journalist, I searched for a long time for a way to bring this issue of sexual assault and harassment on campus into the spotlight but, like me, no-one was comfortable enough to speak out publicly. After reading an article about two incredibly brave rape survivors in India who maintained their anonymity by using social media, Snapchat suddenly seemed like the perfect fit - it\u0027s an innovative and modern platform that millennials are familiar with. The app\u0027s facial and voice-disguising software allows each participant to disguise their identity to the level they\u0027re comfortable with, while capturing their raw emotion and strength. And so I founded a campaign, Revolt Sexual Assault, to expose the real nature and extent of sexual assault and harassment experienced by former and current students at university in the UK, and call for policy reforms to address this problem. I\u0027ve now heard countless stories of sexual violence from brave students - each of which has been incredibly powerful and impossible to forge. Beneath the filters, you can see the deep and long-lasting effects that these assaults have had on survivors. Part of the problem is that people don\u0027t recognise sexual assault and harassment when it happens - because it happens so much. Since I was of secondary school-age I\u0027ve been cat-called at bus stops - men twice my age would shout out what they would like to do to me and my friends. Passers-by didn\u0027t bat an eyelid, so soon I didn\u0027t either - it was \"normal\". I\u0027ve been looked up and down like a piece of meat, I\u0027ve left train carriages and bars because of how uncomfortable I was made to feel, and been told I deserved it for how I was dressed. In broad daylight, on my way to the library, I was groped in the street. In my second year, when someone grabbed my bum in a club and I told them that that was sexual assault, I was met with laughter - and in another case, a punch in the face. I\u0027ve listened to women almost casually open up to experiences of waking up in the night to someone having sex with them, while they had been unconscious - and then go on to rationalise their rapists\u0027 actions, truly believing it was their fault for going home with that boy, or for drinking too much. The sad reality is that the more students I listen to through Revolt Sexual Assault, the same themes emerge: students like me are suffering in silence, blaming themselves and having their student years spoilt because of sexual violence and the lack of support available from universities. But there is very little data available. Universities themselves record very low numbers of sexual assault and harassment. That\u0027s why, in partnership with The Student Room, an online student community, we launched the first national survey on this issue in a decade. The number of responses to the online survey suggests that this problem is widespread. It\u0027s easy to dismiss these statistics because the sample was self-selected and depended on individuals choosing to answer, but behind the numbers there are young people with real stories to tell. We gave students the option to expand on their answers, and thousands felt strongly enough to do so. Reading each of these accounts was heartbreaking. But the most telling results for me were how few respondents felt they had received the help they needed. Many young people experiencing sexual violence in the UK don\u0027t feel supported enough by their universities to go to the police, or to ask for help. Why? Now that movements such as Me Too and Time\u0027s Up have had such an impact, it\u0027s time to have a conversation about sexual violence on campus. Since I first wrote about my own experience, trolls have criticised my story, victim-blamed me, called me an attention seeker, a liar and a slut, devalued my feelings, belittled my campaign and accused me of ruining my attacker\u0027s life (though I have never named him). But I have already done these things to myself. Thousands of young people like me have done them to themselves. And this is why a change in culture is so important. I\u0027ve had the pleasure of meeting some of the strongest, most amazing people through my work at Revolt Sexual Assault. I am in awe of their decision to trust me with their stories. It is thanks to them that I have come to terms with what happened to me. Mark Ames, Director of Student Services at the University of Bristol, said: We\u0027re sorry to hear that Hannah felt unable to report the sexual assault or reach out for any support. The welfare of all our students is vitally important to us and we have a zero-tolerance approach to sexual harassment and clear policies are in place to deal with complaints. Specialist staff, including staff within our student counselling and health services, are trained to respond to incidents of sexual assault and refer students to specialist external agencies such as The Bridge, Bristol\u0027s Sexual Assault Referral Centre. We realise that it can be difficult for students to report these issues. To make this process easier, we are launching an online \u0027Report and Support\u0027 portal this year for survivors of sexual violence and other forms of harassment. We are also introducing major new investments in wellbeing in our academic schools, in central services such as our student counselling and health services, and a review of pastoral support in our halls to provide 24/7 support from staff who are on duty rather than on call.

{"hash":"d3f927a9895df746ce181237a67d9761","title":"Why is Lego not clicking with customers?","author":"bbc","feed":"top","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43300087","content":"Lego\u0027s latest set of annual numbers showed its first drop-off in profits and revenues for 13 years this week. After the Danish toy-maker turned itself around more than a decade ago, last year it failed to click with customers. It said it had produced too many bricks, and had to sell off excess stock at a discount. How can Lego have too many bricks? Isn\u0027t it just that it didn\u0027t manage to sell the sets it had produced?\nIn a way, yes. Every year it forecasts how much Lego it thinks it will need to manage its production, and last year its forecast wasn\u0027t on the money. Though to be fair, for the previous 13 years it has consistently underestimated how much it would need to produce, and hasn\u0027t made enough stock, says Frederique Tutt, global toy industry analyst at the NPD Group. Euromonitor toy analyst Matthew Hudak says \"a big issue is that Lego has now is that it\u0027s grown so quickly with only one product that it inevitably had slow down and hit a wall.\" Lego says its consumer sales in 2017 were flat, but it \"started 2017 with a higher than optimal levels of inventories\". \"The amount of Lego parents bought in 2017 was consistent with the prior year. However, because we sold fewer sets to retailers as we cleaned up inventories, revenues declined,\" it says. Has Lego lost its imagination? Are the pieces getting too specific?\nIt\u0027s a bit harsh to say Lego has lost its imagination, says Ms Tutt. The toy industry like every other is cyclical, and after 13 years it\u0027s \"fair enough to say it can have a rest\", she says. As for the pieces being too specific, she says today\u0027s children \"like to be taken by the hand\" rather than being given a set of generic blocks, and that themed sets have been \"a driver of success\" for Lego. However, in 2017 there \"was a bit too much of Star Wars, not just in Lego, but everywhere\", she says. After three years of successive marketing the market was slightly saturated, she says. In addition, there\u0027s \"not a lot of evidence that a toy company can lean too much on licensing as licensed toys are growing quite a bit globally,\" says Mr Hudak. \"The high proliferation of smartphones allows children to watch their favourite shows all the time, which is growing demand for more licensed products,\" he says. Lego says it hasn\u0027t run out of imagination. \"Only one out of five top selling themes in 2017 was licenced. That was Star Wars. The other themes were those created by our own talented designers.\" Is Lego too expensive?\nLego is more expensive than its direct competitors, but Ms Tutt says its quality is higher. It doesn\u0027t tend to use promotions that much because it doesn\u0027t have to, she says. As for permanently reducing price to stimulate sales - \"I don\u0027t think Lego wants to go that way\", she says. Lego pays licensing for sets that are linked to blockbuster brands such as Star Wars. That cost is directly passed on to consumers, making those sets more expensive. Lego says: \"We believe Lego products are unique and deliver great value for money. In addition, our products meet the highest safety and quality standards and last for generations.\" Has Lego failed to keep up with 2017 trends?\n\"Households can have too many Lego products and not want more each year, and equally important is that children have fickle tastes, and simply lose interest in Lego,\" says Mr Hudak. One of the big trends in 2017 in toys was \"collectibles\" - that is, toys that can be built up into a set. Whereas the year before Lego was more fashionable, in 2017 the focus was on toys such as Lol Surprise! Dolls, says Ms Tutt. However, in terms of what it does, Lego remains the market leader, with about two thirds of the global market in \"construction toys\", says Euromonitor. There was also a general slowdown in the toy market in the UK as people\u0027s disposable income was squeezed by higher inflation and low wage growth, Ms Tutt adds. Lego says: \"We launched some great products in 2017. In addition to our top-selling themes such as Lego City, Lego Friends and Lego Duplo, we introduced new play experiences inspired by the latest digital trends.\" Who are Lego\u0027s main customers?\nBoys aged between 5 and 9. The company has been diversifying towards trying to attract more girls, but boys (or more specifically, their parents, relations, and people with disposable income buying for them) remain the core customers, Ms Tutt says. There are Lego sets aimed at adult collectors, such as a Beatles Yellow Submarine, but these are more niche, says Ms Tutt. Lego\u0027s largest markets are the US, Western Europe - specifically UK, Germany, and France - and China, says Mr Hudak. Could Lego start using reclaimed plastic to help recycling efforts?\nIn a word, no, at least not soon. The type of plastic Lego uses is acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) which is tough to recycle. Reclaimed plastic would not be of a high enough quality. Lego is trying to move towards using more sustainable materials - it recently announced that it is moving towards using \"plant-based polyethylene\" from sugar cane. This is still a hard-wearing plastic. As children become more environmentally aware, Lego is likely to continue to get greener, says Ms Tutt. Lego says: \"We have set ourselves an ambitious target to make our bricks from sustainable sources by 2030... We are also working on developing new materials. Use of recycled materials presents many challenges, and to ensure that the product safety and quality is not compromised we are currently working on finding the right solution for using recycled materials in our products.\" ","date":1520356794000,"topics":["Lego","Companies"]}

How close is the comparison? What did the prime minister say?\nLabour MP Emma Reynolds asked Theresa May to give an example of a border between two countries which are not in a customs union, but do not have checks on lorries crossing the frontier. Mrs May said: \"There are many examples of different arrangements for customs around the rest of the world. \"Indeed we are looking at those, including for example the border between the United States and Canada.\" Is the US-Canada border a \u0027soft border\u0027?\nNo. There is a significant amount of infrastructure at major crossings including checkpoints, areas for marshalling lorries and overhead gantries. Lorries are stopped at the border and there are immigration controls. So it would not meet the UK commitment to avoid a \u0027hard border\u0027?\nNo. The Irish government seems to have anticipated the Canada example. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar visited the border last year. He said it was \"high tech and highly efficient, but make no mistake - it\u0027s a hard border\". He reiterated that position on Monday night saying: \"That is definitely not a solution that we can possibly entertain.\" Does it have any relevance to the Irish border?\nIt may be that the UK government believes that some of the technological and administrative arrangements used at the US-Canada border can help solve the problem in Ireland. Brexit Secretary David Davis has also visited the border, specifically the crossing between Detroit and Windsor, which carries a lot of freight traffic between Ford car factories. He spoke enthusiastically to the Exiting the EU Committee about the trusted trader scheme which operates on that border. \"I looked at the crossing times: 54 seconds. I looked at the mechanisms: easy, cheap, 15 years old,\" he said. \"I watched as drivers went through and had to hand over their ID cards, so they knew that they had never been involved in smuggling. \"Even in the most difficult environment, it worked very well.\" Have there been any other feasibility trips to the US-Canada border?\nThe Commons International Trade Committee visited last month. The pro-Brexit Conservative MP Marcus Fysh made an explicit link with the Irish border saying that the need for \"hard\" border gateways on the border itself is driven by immigration \"which shouldn\u0027t be needed\" if Ireland remains in a Common Travel Area. He described it as a \"very efficient border\", where inspections can be done well back from border itself. However, a fellow committee member, Labour MP Chris Leslie, drew very different conclusions from the trip. \"It\u0027s a hard border and would be devastating between Northern Ireland and the Republic,\" he said. \"More bureaucratic than Dover because each truck has to declare 26 different data elements for 40 different US agencies.\" He described it as \"staggering\" that the prime minister should suggest the US-Canadian border arrangements could be a way forward for the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

Now Public Health England is warning users they are \"dicing with death\". \"I was at a party when a friend shared it with me,\" says Kristello, a 19-year-old rapper from Birmingham, remembering the first time he took Xanax. The drug, also known by the name Alprazolam, is widely prescribed in the US to treat anxiety and can be obtained on private prescription in the UK. But among some teenagers and young adults in the UK it has become a popular recreational drug used illegally. Kristello - who wished to go by his rap name - says his addiction soon grew into a daily habit as he began taking one tablet a night. \"The high felt like it was very floaty, and any worries you had melted away,\" he tells the BBC\u0027s Victoria Derbyshire programme. \"But what you have to take into consideration is what happens after you take Xanax, which is where the problem really starts.\" Nine months ago, after deciding to come off the drug, Kristello struggled sleeping at night and experienced wrenching stomach pains, cold sweats and extreme paranoia. \"It can be really bad on your mental health,\" he says. \"You can experience blackout with memory loss. Your long-term memory can be affected as well.\" Lethal combination\nXanax has previously been glorified by hip hop artists, and is often featured in lyrics. In November 2017, the rapper Lil Peep was found dead after an overdose of Xanax mixed with fentanyl - a powerful synthetic painkiller. It is a lethal combination which, officials say, users risk being repeated when buying counterfeit Xanax online and through street dealers - because they cannot be sure how the drug has been mixed. According to National Crime Agency (NCA) figures, 113 people have died using fentanyl in the last 12 months in the UK. \"The danger we\u0027ve got here is young people who are used to taking the drug [Xanax] who think they know what they are doing,\" says Tony Saggers, former head of drugs threat at the NCA. \"The great disaster is when these tablets are supplied between friends, and one friend kills another friend because they\u0027ve sold them something without knowing what it was.\" \u0027Xanax party\u0027\n\"These are two Xanax bars. I spent £5 for both,\" says 18-year-old \"Kieran\" - not his real name. About twice a month, on a Friday or Saturday night, Kieran and his friends gather for a Xanax \"drug party\" at his one-bedroom flat in Dudley. There are 12 people milling around in his living room. Some are playing PlayStation, drinking alcohol - others are mixing Xanax with other illegal drugs. \"The best way to describe it is you feel like a marshmallow. It\u0027s a very chilled drug,\" says Kieran\u0027s friend \"Jordan\", also aged 18. Jordan and Kieran - who say they have unintentionally taken counterfeit Xanax spiked with fentanyl in the past - swallow the tiny white pills with alcohol, which makes it even more dangerous. \"I feel really, like, drowsy. I feel a lot like a cloud. I just feel comfortable,\" says Jordan 20 minutes later. When challenged about the potential dangers they are exposing themselves to, both say they are aware of the risks but choose to take it anyway. \"I guess sometimes we see past [the warnings], we don\u0027t really think about it. We see on the media people passing away but it doesn\u0027t seem to faze anyone really.\" \u0027Dicing with death\u0027\nExperts say that, despite the warnings, the use of counterfeit Xanax appears to be growing, though there are no figures available to know exactly how widespread its use is. \"It is a real and immediate concern among the young people who it seems to be a drug of choice for,\" says Rosanna O\u0027Connor, Public Health England\u0027s head of alcohol, drugs and tobacco. \"People buy things from the internet and they have no guarantee of what they are getting so whatever is in the drugs they buy could change from one drug to another, so they are dicing with death really because these things are dangerous.\" Pfizer, the company that developed Xanax as a prescription drug, said it was \"alarmed\" by the rise of counterfeit versions of Xanax that, it said, have been found to contain acid, heavy metals and even floor polish. A government spokesman said it was \"taking coordinated action to tackle illegal drug use alongside other criminal activity. \"Law enforcement agencies continue to work with internet providers to shut down UK-based websites found to be selling prescription-only medicines illegally. \"Prescription-only medicines are potent and should only be prescribed by a doctor or appropriate healthcare professional.\" Anne McDermott, from Edinburgh, knows all too well the extreme risks associated with the drug. Her son Scott died aged 34 when she says he took Xanax. She believes the substance - which has been linked to a number of deaths across Scotland\u0027s capital - is responsible for killing her son in January. \"The first time he took Xanax he was completely out of it. He went back the next day, the next day and the following day, and that\u0027s what happened. \"It was an extremely powerful, potent drug.\" Watch the BBC\u0027s Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel.

{"hash":"64e88affa1635969e0a1f82a460cc261","title":"Reality Check: Are property developers hoarding land?","author":"bbc","feed":"top","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43287565","content":"The claim: The body representing developers says that they do not hoard land - they are building houses as quickly as they can. Reality Check verdict: There is currently a large gap between how many planning permissions are granted and how many houses are built. On average over the last decade, government figures show only half of granted planning permissions have resulted in building work being started. But we can\u0027t say exactly why developers are doing this - whether it\u0027s for profit, because of delays in the planning system or for another reason. The prime minister has said she will tackle the failure to build enough houses in England. As part of this, Theresa May said she would make it harder for developers to hang on to land for which they have been granted planning permission without building on it. Labour\u0027s shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne told BBC 5 live at the weekend: \"There are thousands of planning applications that have been granted and yet developers are just sitting on that land - land banking whilst those developments that are chronically needed, just aren\u0027t being built.\" But the Home Builders Federation, which represents developers, disputes that this so-called \"land banking\" is happening. Their planning director, Andrew Whitaker, said: \"Having gone to the expense and time of getting a permission, builders cannot afford to sit on it.\" Unused land\nHousing charity Shelter has looked at how quickly developers build. For each year they looked at the gap between planning permission being granted, building work starting, and completing. They allowed an 18-month gap between permission being granted and starting building, and another 18 months between building work starting and completing. On average between 2006 and 2014 in England, fewer than 45% of all planning permissions granted were started and fewer than 50% completed. That suggests that half of all planning permission applications don\u0027t result in building activity at all. The problem is, this doesn\u0027t tell us why developers are sitting on the land. It also doesn\u0027t mean these projects will never be built. One key reason that developers might wait is so they have a \"pipeline\" of land to develop on in the future. Dan Lewis, a senior infrastructure advisor at the Institute of Directors, says: \"The last thing you want to do if you are a housing company is develop all your land at once, because then you\u0027ll go bankrupt.\" Government review\nAs numbers of permissions granted have gone up, house building has not kept pace meaning the gap between permissions and housing supply has grown considerably. This is something the government is already looking into as part of a review headed up by Conservative MP Sir Oliver Letwin. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government says that as of July 2016, just over half the 684,000 homes with planning permission had been completed. Analysis from the Local Government Association, which represents local councils, found last year there were 423,544 unimplemented planning permissions. But a Home Builders Federation spokesman said these permissions are measured \"at the point when the first condition is discharged but some permissions have 100-plus conditions attached that take months or years to discharge before builders are actually allowed to start building\". He added: \"So a lot of the \u0027permissions\u0027 are stuck making their way through the planning system via understaffed local authority planning departments.\" \u0027Pipeline\u0027\nCritics say developers hold on to land as an asset. Instead of building on it, once developers have been granted planning permission they may be able to sell that land on at a profit to be developed by someone else. Shelter accepts that these figures are not necessarily all because developers are speculating for profit. But nevertheless their figures point clearly to the fact that there is land which is available for house building, on which houses have not yet been built. The cause of this delay, however, is harder to pin down. ","date":1520273101000,"topics":["Reality Check","Reality Check","Andrew Gwynne","Theresa May"]}

{"hash":"536a0abb993d29fa74066c472b13c6eb","title":"Fancy charging up your electric car in 10 minutes?","author":"bbc","feed":"top","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43285885","content":"Imagine being able to charge your electric car in minutes rather than hours, or your smartphone in seconds. That\u0027s the enticing prospect being touted by researchers who reckon they\u0027ve discovered a new material that could boost the performance of a carbon-based supercapacitor - sometimes called an ultracapacitor - a type of energy storage device that can be charged very quickly and offload its power very quickly, too. Dr Donald Highgate, director of research at Superdielectrics Ltd, says a material he originally developed for soft contact lenses is also surprisingly good at holding an electrostatic field. Very simply, supercapacitors don\u0027t produce electricity through chemical reactions as conventional batteries do, they create these electrostatic fields. Dr Highgate is working with Bristol and Surrey universities to develop supercapacitors using the new polymer and hopes that they could eventually rival, or even surpass, lithium-ion (li-ion) batteries - so long as they manage to replicate prototype performance on a large scale. So far, supercapacitors have been good at providing quick bursts of power - to start a car engine, for example, or to give trains a boost when accelerating. They\u0027re also well-suited to harvesting energy from vehicles when they brake, making them an important component in electric vehicles. And national electricity grids use them to provide quick power top-ups when balancing supply and demand. South Korea\u0027s capital Seoul is hoping to have 3,500 supercapacitor-powered buses operating by 2020, and they\u0027re also being used in Shanghai, China. European car maker PSA Peugeot Citroen has been using them in its cars since 2010 - supercapacitor maker Maxwell Technologies says more than a million vehicles now incorporate its products. But to date, supercapacitors haven\u0027t been very good at holding much power or holding on to that power for very long. This poor energy density, as it\u0027s called, the amount of power they can hold per kilogramme, has put them at a significant disadvantage to li-ion batteries. More Technology of Business\n\"The two main advantages of conventional supercapacitors over batteries are their ability to handle much higher charge and discharge rates, and their longer cycle life,\" says Gareth Hinds, Fellow of the UK\u0027s National Physical Laboratory. \"The downside is that they tend to be relatively high cost and can only store a few seconds-, or at most, minutes-worth of power.\" This isn\u0027t a problem when your supercapacitor is being used to power a tool on a factory assembly line, for example. It can be recharged in seconds once it\u0027s placed back in its charging dock. But it is if you\u0027re in an electric car or bus that needs recharging every few miles. Taavi Madiberk, chief executive and co-founder of Skeleton Technologies, a supercapacitor maker based in Estonia, Germany and Finland, says his products incorporate layers of graphene - a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice - and other carbon-based materials in its supercapacitors. These layers have a huge surface area - just 1g of graphene can cover 2,000 sq m, says Mr Madiberk. This allows them to hold on to a lot more power. His firm\u0027s products are already used in hybrid vehicles, particularly buses and lorries. In one experiment, they installed supercapacitors in a Sainsbury\u0027s supermarket diesel-electric delivery van and \"achieved 32% fuel savings\", says Mr Madiberk. But he acknowledges that in the short-term, combining supercapacitors with li-ion batteries is probably the best way to enjoy the best of both worlds, particularly in electric vehicles. Ulrik Grape, chief executive of NaWa technologies, another supercapacitor maker based in the South of France, agrees, saying: \"Supercapacitors don\u0027t store as much energy but their response is instantaneous. So a supercapacitor could handle acceleration and energy recovery under braking - taking care of the stressful part of a battery\u0027s life - possibly doubling or tripling a battery\u0027s life expectancy.\" NaWa\u0027s technology involves electrodes made from \"vertically aligned carbon and graphene nanotubes that can store the energy on the surface of these tubes,\" explains Mr Grape. These tubes, which are coated with another carbon-based material, are so tiny you can fit 10 billion of them in a square centimetre. As carbon is a light material, incorporating supercapacitors into li-ion batteries would also reduce the overall weight, and this would improve the range performance of an electric vehicle. A Formula E racing car\u0027s battery, currently made by Williams Advanced Engineering, weighs 300kg, but this could be reduced by a third to 200kg, NaWa believes, without any loss of range. \"We think the ability to charge and discharge a battery fast will be one of the most important things in the future,\" says Mr Grape. \"We don\u0027t have as much energy as a lithium-ion battery but we can do many more cycles - charges and discharges - up to a million. Carbon is such a robust material.\" By contrast, a normal battery, which relies on chemical reactions to create electricity, eventually wears out once those chemicals lose their potency - after about 3,000 to 5,000 cycles of charging and discharging. Another advantage of supercapacitors, makers say, is that they don\u0027t require rare materials, such as cobalt. Of course, supercapacitors don\u0027t mean the end of traditional batteries by any means. Li-ion technology is still being improved by about 5-10% each year. New forms of energy storage will be critical to the success of renewable energy as a replacement for fossil fuels. When the sun doesn\u0027t shine or the wind doesn\u0027t blow, we\u0027ll need to access stored energy very quickly to plug the gap. As well as traditional energy storage methods, such as pumped hydro, flywheels, compressed gas and large battery arrays, highly efficient supercapacitors could eventually become a crucial component in a fully sustainable energy network. But these are early days. \"Polymer-based supercapacitors are emerging as a promising technology,\" concludes Gareth Hinds, \"but there is a lot of work still to do to achieve the required energy storage capacity without compromising on power, lifetime and cost.\" ","date":1520295329000,"topics":["Renewable energy"]}

Here are the contrasting looks chosen by seven A-listers on Sunday - plus one who managed to find three dresses for the occasion. Britain\u0027s Emily Blunt was demureness personified at the ceremony in a powder blue gown with a high collar, puffy sleeves and a regal train. By the time she rocked up at the Vanity Fair party, though, she\u0027d traded it for a figure-hugging gold number with floral and avian detailing. The sequins and tassles of her Givenchy gown ensured Wonder Woman star Gal Gadot sparkled on the red carpet. Her post-show frock also twinkled, though this one came with a daring thigh slash and an ever more plunging neckline. Salma Hayek made a bold statement at the ceremony with a tiered purple gown topped with elaborate crystal chain mail. The eccentricity continued afterwards with a pink Gucci gown customised by Harlem designer Dapper Dan. Best supporting actress winner Allison Janney rocked it in red in a Reem Acra gown with carpet-caressing angel sleeves. The I, Tonya star remained a scarlet woman at the Vanity Fair party... from the waist down at least. Margot Robbie looked ready to walk down the aisle in a Chanel Haute Couture gown she reportedly mended herself when one of its arm straps broke. That got traded at the Vanity Fair event for an intricately detailed ivory number with a sheer overlay, topped off by a sparkly globe-shaped purse. Emma Stone, last year\u0027s best actress winner, returned to the Oscars in a silk Louis Vuitton blazer adorned with a bright pink sash. A few hours later, she reappeared in a yellow and grey mini-dress. Zendaya, star of The Greatest Showman, seemed to have a circus tent in mind with this off-the-shoulder chocolate creation. The fishtail gown she wore at the Vanity Fair event was considerably more flattering to the 21-year-old\u0027s figure.

Mentioned by Frances McDormand at the end of her best actress acceptance speech, it refers to a clause actors can insist be added to their contracts. \"[It] means that you can ask for and/or demand at least 50% diversity, not only in casting but also [in] the crew,\" she explained backstage afterwards. Its mention prompted a dramatic surge of interest in the term on Google. Many people also searched for inclusion \"writer\", having misheard the final sentence of McDormand\u0027s rousing address. McDormand said she had only become aware of the term recently. But it\u0027s actually been around since 2016. It was coined by media researcher Stacy Smith in a TED talk she gave that year, in which she posited ways to show more women, ethnic minorities and people with disabilities on screen. Dr Smith came up with the concept with Kalpana Kotagal, a civil rights and employment practice attorney in Washington DC, and the producer and actor Fanshen Cox DiGiovanni. The University of Southern California professor argues that an \"equity clause\" in an A-list actor\u0027s contract could allow the film\u0027s minor on-screen roles \"to match or reflect the demography of where the story is taking place\". Speaking to an audience in San Francisco, Dr Smith said: \"The typical feature film has about 40 to 45 speaking characters in it. I would argue that only 8 to 10 of those characters are actually relevant to the story. \"The remaining 30 or so roles, there\u0027s no reason why those minor roles can\u0027t match or reflect the demography of where the story is taking place. \"An equity rider by an A-lister in their contract can stipulate that those roles reflect the world in which we actually live.\" Speaking after the awards, Dr Smith said the mention had come as a \"complete surprise\" and that she was \"utterly elated\" that McDormand - who won for her role in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri - had so publicly championed her proposal. \"The goal is that talent can take the inclusion rider and adopt it in ways that make sense for their values and their beliefs,\" she told The Guardian. The good news is that some A-listers are already taking the initiative when it comes to using their position to negotiate a more representative work space. \"I\u0027m committed to the Inclusion Rider,\" tweeted Brie Larson, Oscar-winning star of Room and the forthcoming Captain Marvel. \"Who\u0027s with me?\" McDormand also got the backing of former tennis player Billie Jean King, British screenwriter Jack Thorne and Pitch Perfect star Elizabeth Banks.

{"hash":"40630dbc745f6a1b2c978f0da9d56886","title":"The day Putin cried","author":"bbc","feed":"top","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-43260651","content":"As Russia prepares to elect Vladimir Putin for a fourth term as president on 18 March, the BBC\u0027s Gabriel Gatehouse looks back at a revealing event that took place at the start of his Kremlin career - when he was Russia\u0027s acting president, running in his first presidential election. Russians rarely see their president cry, though there has been plenty of tragedy during his 18 years in power. It happened once, right at the start of his rule - on 24 February 2000, at the funeral of Anatoly Sobchak. Sobchak was one of the men who, alongside Gorbachev and Yeltsin, helped bring about the end of the Soviet Union. He was also the reformer who plucked a middle-ranking KGB officer by the name of Vladimir Putin from obscurity and gave him his first job in politics. No-one really knows what drove him to make that fateful decision. But today, factions from the old Soviet security establishment have taken hold of the levers of power in Russia to such an extent as to make it a democracy hardly worth the name. There are eight candidates running in this latest election, but Putin is known as the \"main candidate\", and the outcome is not in any doubt. One rival candidate calls it a \"fake election\". \"Just like in a casino,\" she told me, \"where the house always wins, in Russian democracy, the win is always on Putin\u0027s side.\" Her name - wait for it - is Ksenia Sobchak, and she is the daughter of Anatoly, Putin\u0027s old friend and mentor. Find out more\nKsenia, as she is often known, is 36 years old, a former reality TV presenter-turned-opposition-journalist. Supporters of Alexei Navalny, the quote-unquote \"real\" opposition candidate, who\u0027s been barred from standing, say she is a Kremlin stooge - an old family friend drafted in by Putin to lend the election an air of credibility. Certainly, she would not be running without the tacit permission of the authorities. That\u0027s how Russian democracy works. But the men in grey suits who run the Kremlin may be regretting their decision. Ksenia is touring TV studios naming corrupt cronies around Putin and calling the annexation of Crimea illegal. If, as she maintains, she is running not to win but to be heard, then she is certainly breaking some taboos. So what on Earth is going on? Let\u0027s leave the daughter for a moment and go back to the father. He was mayor of St Petersburg. Putin was his deputy. The two were so close that when Sobchak senior was accused of corruption, Putin helped spirit him out of the country on a specially chartered aeroplane. That was in the 1990s. Remember those days? Russia was in chaos. Its president, Boris Yeltsin, was frequently drunk and barely functioning. The men in grey suits in the Kremlin thought they\u0027d found just the solution - another grey man, a blank slate, from which to build the ideal antidote to Yeltsin. They began grooming Putin as his successor. Then, suddenly, just as Putin was running for president for the first time, his old friend Anatoly Sobchak died, at the age of 62, in a hotel room in Kaliningrad. The autopsy said it was cardiac arrest but can\u0027t find any trace of a heart attack. Sobchak\u0027s widow suspected foul play and had her own autopsy done. Her name is Lyudmila Narusova. I met her recently and asked her if she thought her husband had been murdered. She paused long enough to say \"Yes\" 10 times over, and then replied: \"I don\u0027t know.\" Some have suggested Putin may have had a hand in his death. Did Sobchak have something on him? Narusova dismissed that idea out of hand I went back and looked at the footage of the funeral. Putin really is distraught. His eyes are red, he seems to struggle to swallow as he embraces Lyudmila Narusova. Putin is not an actor. Nor is he prone to public displays of emotion. So it\u0027s reasonable to assume that he is struggling with some genuine grief. Or is it something else. Guilt? \"There were people who were manoeuvring Putin into power,\" Narusova told me. She\u0027s right. Back then, Putin was a vehicle to power for various factions inside the Kremlin. To some extent he still is. If Sobchak was murdered, was it by one of those factions who feared his mentor\u0027s hold over him? Maybe. And if so, did the old KGB officer realise his old friend died in the furtherance of Project Putin. It\u0027s only a suspicion, but I\u0027m beginning to think so. I asked Narusova about that autopsy she had done. It turns out she never made the results public, but keeps the documents locked in a safe in a secret location outside Russia. When I asked her why, she didn\u0027t want to talk about it. I pressed her. I said, \"It sounds like you\u0027ve got yourself some kind of insurance policy.\" \"You could see it that way,\" she responded. \"Are you afraid,\" I asked, \"for your own safety or that of your daughter?\" She paused for a moment. \"You know,\" she said, \"to live in this country is scary. Especially for those who hold opposition views. So yes, I am afraid.

Lightning never strikes twice, so they say. Except when it does.\"I want our story to remain shocking forever - but I\u0027m worried that already we\u0027re not alone,\" Celia Randolph says. On the surface they are a normal family - mum, dad, four kids. They\u0027ve lived in small towns in America that seemed safe. Celia\u0027s children speak carefully and precisely, like their mother. \"I\u0027m not an emotional person,\" Celia explains. \"But I\u0027m now very angry and I\u0027m very sad. America has failed our kids. What happened to my daughter in 2006 shook me and my husband to the core.\" Then on Valentine\u0027s Day this year she got a text. Celia saw the words: \"You\u0027re not near Parkland are you? There\u0027s been a shooting.\" \"I kept saying to myself, \u0027Not again, not again\u0027.\" Celia dropped everything: \"When it happens, you run. You run.\" Her son Christian is a junior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Parkland, Florida. The first time someone called Celia to say a gunman was in her child\u0027s school was 12 years ago. She and her husband Jason were 50 miles from home. \"We raced to get to her.\" Chelsea was 14 years old and they were living in Bailey, a small mountain town in Colorado. The Columbine massacre, in which 13 people were killed, had happened in 1999 just under an hour away but the beautiful forest and mountains gave their home a secluded, quiet feeling. When Chelsea tells her story - which she\u0027s never spoken about publicly before - she\u0027s anxious: \"What happened to other families is worse. Don\u0027t overshadow them.\" She\u0027s talking about the family of her friend Emily Keyes - the 16-year-old was killed in the violent end to a hostage crisis in their school in 2006. The gunman had entered the Platte Canyon High School with a handgun and a rucksack he said held explosives. He took six girls hostage in a classroom. The siege ended four hours later when a Swat team blew a hole in the wall. At first Chelsea hid under a table in the classroom opposite, holding her best friend\u0027s hand. When a Swat team knocked down the door, they escaped. \"You have to understand, to see a man with a full-on vest, with full-on attire, and a gun bursting into your classroom telling you to get out - you have no idea what is going to happen to you,\" she says. \"As we ran out, in every corner we saw a Swat man with a gun. I saw my friend in one classroom, petrified and pale. He couldn\u0027t speak.\" Once Chelsea made it home with her parents, they watched the crisis play out on TV. She watched helicopters, police, guns swarm over her school. \"We didn\u0027t know who the hostages were but we could piece together the classroom timetable and who would have been in there.\" Accurate information was hard to come by. Her only option was to watch TV to find out what happened to her captive classmates. \"We saw the girls released one by one - there was a hill by the school and we watched them running for their lives up it.\" After a pause, she continues, \"I remember an image of a stretcher coming out of the school and put in a helicopter.\" The shootings shattered Celia: \"it was very, very difficult. You just think, \u0027I can\u0027t protect my kids.\u0027 It\u0027s horrible. \"It took away the sense of security that I hoped my children would have. A stranger came into our world and did this terrible thing. You felt like, if it could happen there, where could you keep your family safe? \"We raised our children teaching them to be more afraid of harm from animals than from people.\" You might also be interested in: She consoled herself with the thought that she didn\u0027t feel it was a targeted attack on the school. \"The emphasis was on healing and performing random acts of kindness. We all considered it a random act of violence rather than a \u0027school shooting\u0027.\" But her sadness made her feel guilty. \"I would think I get to hug Chelsea, what\u0027s wrong with me for being upset?\" She says looking after a traumatised child took its toll, but that she and her husband gave their children a stable upbringing. \"We have good family relationships and we loved them. I don\u0027t think it changed our family life permanently.\" Chelsea finished the school year and in 2007 the family left Colorado, returning to Celia and Jason\u0027s roots in Florida. Family life ticked by and although Celia never felt that she had closure, she says they\u0027ve been \"very blessed\". Twelve years on, gun laws have barely altered in the US. An estimated 57 mass shootings have happened between 2006 and 2018. Still, Celia found it unimaginable that it would happen to another of her children. The second time someone called Celia to say a gunman was in her child\u0027s school was two weeks ago. Christian is 16 and is quiet with a calm manner. He\u0027s smart and Celia and Jason chose Marjory Stoneman Douglas, in Parkland, Florida, for its academic reputation. He was in a culinary class when he and his classmates heard shots. Their teacher, Ashley Kurth, pushed them into a cupboard. \"At first we didn\u0027t take it seriously but then we got quieter and quieter. I resigned myself to the floor. I couldn\u0027t convey any emotions because we had to stay silent. People were texting their parents, but I couldn\u0027t - I had forgotten to charge my phone.\" After getting the news, Celia ran to her car. She got as close to the school as possible. \"I couldn\u0027t get any information. I was texting him and he didn\u0027t respond,\" she explains. \"That killed me. I was only thinking, \"Is my child alive? Is he scared? Is he injured?\" A barricade was blocking parents\u0027 access to the grounds as police searched for the gunman. Christian\u0027s teacher let into her classroom more children who\u0027d been trapped in hallway. They listened to police updates through a walkie-talkie. She reassured the teenagers that, should the gunman find them, they were in a kitchen surrounded by huge knives. Like his sister, Christian remembers the Swat team bursting in: \"They shouted, \u0027Hands up, lie down.\u0027 They couldn\u0027t be sure one of us wasn\u0027t the shooter.\" On the way out Christian saw blood on the stairs outside his classroom. \"We ran to the street. There were helicopters, police, military equipment everywhere. We were allowed to see our parents. At first I was so happy I was out of there but then I became sadder and sadder.\" While Chelsea had felt isolated by the memories of what she witnessed, Christian has the dubious fortune of having a sibling who also survived a shooting. \"She told me she too wanted to stay inside when it happened, that it took her a while to feel anything, that she felt numb at first. She said she broke down, got better, then four years later broke down again. For all the wrong reasons, it\u0027s wonderful to have her. She already knows what\u0027s going to happen to me - she\u0027s just waiting,\" he says. For Celia, two weeks after the Parkland shooting, the realisation that not one but two of her children have been caught up in and, thankfully, survived school shootings is sinking in. Celia\u0027s experience means she knows what\u0027s coming for the Parkland community, even before they do. \"The other parents and children injured will be dealing with their trauma for a long, long time. I feel sad I know what\u0027s going to happen next.\" \"I\u0027m really struggling to cope with the idea that two of my children had to dodge bullets. It\u0027s so sad to me that I have a child that went through it and now has to comfort her little brother.\" She\u0027s in a community message group - members recently asked what the millions of crowdfunded dollars will be used for. After all, the funeral and medical expenses of the victims will be met by the local county. \"There are costs they can\u0027t imagine right now. The parents who can\u0027t work because of hospital visits or caring for traumatised kids still have mortgages to pay. It\u0027s for the counselling for the kids, which will take years. But they don\u0027t know all of that yet,\" she explains. She\u0027s seen one community cope with the aftermath of a shooting already. Although she says Bailey \"came together in an amazing way\" she says \"processing what\u0027s happened takes time\". \"Not all the kids in Parkland are going to do well. They\u0027re not all going to come out of this OK. You don\u0027t have a concept of how long this road is going to be, and not only for the victims\u0027 families,\" she warns. It\u0027s the first time she\u0027s told many people what happened in 2006 - the reaction is one of shock. The family, who found the media circus in both shootings intrusive and traumatising, want to speak publicly to call for an end to school shootings. \"We are not anti-gun, but we are against these weapons of war being so readily available. We need not to fail our kids. People can\u0027t believe our family has been through two shootings, but I\u0027m not so sure the chances aren\u0027t pretty good of there being more like us unless we do something about this.\" The teenagers from Stoneman Douglas went back to school last week, some of them now famous for their passionate calls to end to gun violence. In the days since the shooting, President Trump shocked lawmakers by calling for the type of gun law changes that Republicans rarely back, and major retailers have reduced access to some weapons or ended links with the National Rifle Association. Celia has seen the cycle of violence, public outrage and a return to status quo many times. \"If Sandy Hook couldn\u0027t change things, will this?\" She wants the conversation to move away from debates about mental health and expanding access to guns to teachers, saying: \"Until there\u0027s alternative political funding that\u0027s not from the NRA, there won\u0027t be any change.\" But she believes there is something different this time. \"These kids have access to social media and are very articulate but also privileged. The kids have shamed the adults into action. I love them dearly for it and my family has joined them. Now they need to go to school and just be kids. It is our duty as the adults. It\u0027s not too late for us.\" On Wednesday, Christian returned for one day to the classroom where he hid from a gunman. \"I do know that he has not yet been hit with that punch of realisation of what he and his school have been through. This is where my experience of the past makes me sad. That said, it makes Jason and I more understanding of him when that time comes,\" Celia explains. The next day, events began to catch up with Christian and he was unable to go to school.

{"hash":"790811d7119dd5e23af93cac38dd52e3","title":"Is there a problem with unregistered schools?","author":"bbc","feed":"top","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43170447","content":"School inspectors have warned that there are hundreds of unregistered schools but that they have few powers to investigate or shut them down. When you think of a place that teaches groups of children - all day, every day - the word most people would use is \"school\". But the law in England is surprisingly vague on what a school actually is. More than 350 sites - suspected of being unregistered schools - have been investigated in England by education watchdog Ofsted since a specialist taskforce was set up two years ago. Ofsted inspectors say they don\u0027t have proper powers to inspect or close them. The people running these sites say they are not schools at all. Some of them are on industrial estates, in church basements and even in pubs. The BBC has obtained pictures showing squalor, appalling food hygiene and dangerous wiring. Some premises have blocked fire escapes and no access to clean drinking water. Many sites do no criminal records checking of staff. But because of the confusing legal situation, most remain open. The tearful mother\nSuri\u0027s son is about to leave his primary and go to big school. Not every parent is happy about the choice of education they end up with, but Suri - not her real name - breaks down in tears when she thinks about where her boy is going. Later this year he will start at a \"yeshiva\" in the Haredi ultra-orthodox Jewish community in Stamford Hill, north London. It is not registered and its premises and teaching go unmonitored by the authorities. Suri\u0027s son will never do GCSEs there, as these yeshivas usually don\u0027t provide any maths, English or science despite operating full-time. Instead they offer a wholly religious education for boys, focused on scripture, from the age of 13. At their schools, girls are often able to study secular subjects and do exams, but after a Haredi boy\u0027s Bar Mitzvah, devotion to religious education is imperative. Those who run yeshivas would argue that they are not schools and therefore don\u0027t have to abide by the rules that the state imposes. If you have any information or experience with unregistered schools that you are willing to share with the BBC you can get in touch with us, in confidence, at haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk And the Department for Education seems to accept that yeshivas are not technically schools. In a statement, the DfE told the BBC that yeshivas \"do not meet the definition of a school and cannot therefore be prosecuted for operating as an unregistered school\". The DfE guidelines for England say that any place that teaches five or more children for at least 18 hours a week needs to be registered as a school. In Wales, anywhere offering \"full-time education\" is expected to register. In Northern Ireland the law requires all independent schools to register. The same applies in Scotland. But legal guidance known to have been cited by the DfE says a site is not technically a school if it doesn\u0027t teach general classes of education, such as maths, English or science. Hence any place that only teaches religious education - be it Muslim, Jewish, Christian or any other faith - is arguably not a school. But critics say that it is bizarre that a building - where children of school age are taught full-time - is not deemed a school. \"Of course they\u0027re schools,\" says Jay Harman, of pressure group Humanists UK, which campaigns on the issue of unregistered schools. \"These are places which provide children their only education from dawn till dusk. The fact that it\u0027s scriptural doesn\u0027t detract from their status as schools.\" For the critics, to define the yeshivas as anything other than schools would suggest that the children are getting their main form of education elsewhere. The law demands all children have an efficient full-time education, whether at a school or at home. That\u0027s simply not happening, says Izzy Posen, 23, who was at a Stamford Hill yeshiva from the age of 13. \"Children are in a yeshiva from as early as 8am until as late as 9pm - if that isn\u0027t a school, I\u0027m not sure what is. \"They\u0027re not taught anything else at home. There\u0027s no secular studies but this is the sole education I got - I didn\u0027t get any other. I couldn\u0027t speak or write English. \"When I came out of these yeshivas, I had to teach myself English because I was never taught English. \"I remember at 18 reading an elementary school text book. I had no idea what the maths Pi symbol meant.\" Certainly Suri believes that going to yeshiva will mean that her son does not get a full education. \"There is no education at all and we\u0027re living in Britain - boys can\u0027t speak English,\" Suri says. She acknowledges that many Haredi parents are happy for their children to only have religious education. But Suri believes her sons will struggle to get jobs if they ever want to find work. \"They\u0027ll have no future. They\u0027ll be stuck on benefits and left behind. Culture is important, identity is important, but there has to be a balance.\" Suri belongs to one of the more conservative groupings within the Haredi community. She says if she were to try to enrol her son in a different school - even another Haredi one in Stamford Hill - she would face shame both in her community and within her own family. \"We\u0027d be considered bad parents. We\u0027d be ostracised.\" Suri took an unusual step and contacted Hackney Council and Ofsted to press them to close the unregistered schools or launch inspections. Despite acknowledging that these places exist, the authorities said they couldn\u0027t help her. But as well as the yeshivas for boys aged 13-16, the BBC has found two suspected Haredi primaries that have never been inspected by Ofsted. One was based in a building belonging to a synagogue in Westcliff-on-Sea, in Essex, but run separately by a Haredi group. The children there were much younger than those one would see at a yeshiva. The synagogue denies that an unregistered school is being run on the premises. It says that the education provided is within the 18-hour limit. But when the BBC observed it, it was operating for longer hours. We filmed footage of a teacher appearing to manhandle a distressed child on one occasion, and strike a different boy on another. These incidents showed \"huge safeguarding issues\", according to Anne Longfield, the Children\u0027s Commissioner. The synagogue said it had not been aware of any assaults and has requested more information. It has since suspended the school. Another suspected unregistered primary school was located in a house in Hackney, where at least 30 young boys could be observed arriving at the beginning of the school day. When we knocked at the door we were told it was a club and advised to speak to a man - Moses Lewis - who says he advises \"schools and non-schools\" in the area. He points out that there are many more registered schools than unregistered ones. \"I don\u0027t think we give the country much trouble by the way we educate our children.\" He says he is confident that the law is not being broken. \"If somebody\u0027s got the courage, be it the Department for Education, be it Ofsted, let them pluck up the courage and bring a prosecution and let\u0027s fight it out in court.\" In January, Hackney Council released its long-delayed investigation into the 30 or so unregistered educational sites in the borough. It called for greater inspection powers. Eli Spitzer is the headmaster of a registered school in north London, but attended two unregistered schools himself. He took GCSEs after graduating from a yeshiva and believes a solution can be found if the Department for Education acts. \"The overwhelming majority of schools are registered. \"If parents are reassured that what the authorities want is purely and simply compliance with the law, and are willing to accommodate their desire to educate their children in this type of way, I see no reason why we shouldn\u0027t be able to find a solution to this.\" While he acknowledges there are some major obstacles - such as the teaching of sex education - he says regulatory inertia is responsible for the presence of so many unregistered schools. \"Like every industry that is unregulated, people just act with impunity, start taking advantage, start cutting corners - compliance and health and safety for example.\" The confrontation\nOn a morning in July 2017, three Ofsted inspectors visited a building in central London they suspected of housing an unregistered school. Just a mile\u0027s walk from the Tower of London, the site in Whitechapel was housed in a four-storey block on a stretch of Commercial Road, surrounded by women\u0027s clothes wholesalers and curry restaurants. After they arrived, inspectors allege they were called \"Britain First paedophiles\" - a reference to the far-right group - by a former headteacher, Mohammed Umair. Umair is now facing prosecution for racially abusing Ofsted inspectors. He denies abusing them. Umair was issued with a warning notice by the inspectors for allegedly running a school on the site. The year before, Ayasofia Primary, a registered school he had run from a building nearby was shut down after inspections found failings. But Umair maintains he wasn\u0027t operating an unregistered school and says the centre was being run by someone else on a part-time basis. Isolated communities\nLast September, Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu addressed the general issue of unregistered schools. He said in \"segregated and isolated communities, unregulated and home schooling are a breeding ground for extremism and future terrorism\". The BBC has obtained a book from an unregistered school for young children in Birmingham that advocates the murder of gay people. \"Those guilty of this crime are to be killed by the sword,\" says a passage in Forbidden, written by Muhammad Saleh al-Munajjid. Another chapter warns a wife against refusing sex with her husband. Elsewhere it says a woman wearing perfume is an adulterer. The book \"undermines the values which British schools seek to promote\" and \"could potentially isolate young impressionable minds of Muslim schoolchildren\", according to Dr Iqtidar Cheema, director of the Institute for Leadership and Community Development, run by the charity Muslim Aid. \"Such moral and conceptual isolation is the first step to radicalisation.\" Dr Farid Panjwani of the Institute of Education says some Muslims perceive they are marginalised and that unregistered schools may be a product of that. A number of factors, including the government\u0027s anti-radicalisation Prevent strategy and episodes of Islamophobia, lead to some Muslims feeling \"disproportionate scrutiny\", he says. \"We should not generalise. The vast majority of schools with Muslim religious character are registered and doing well, some of them are performing at the top of the country.\" A school in a church\nIn September 2015 a mixed school called Enterprise Diamond was set up in the basement of St Swithun\u0027s Church in Lewisham, south-east London. Nine pupils were enrolled. Some had previously been home schooled. The parents of others did not want them going to a Pupil Referral Unit - a centre that educates children who are expelled or otherwise unable to attend school. The school was set up by Kay Johnston. She had attempted to register it but started lessons before the process was finished. Soon after, Johnston faced serious allegations from her time at another school in 2014. She was accused of assaulting a five year-old pupil with learning difficulties. Johnston was also claimed to have pushed the child off a chair. After reviewing CCTV footage, a panel from the National College for Teaching and Leadership banned Johnston from teaching in January 2016. She denies striking the child and says she was bitten and kicked several times. Johnston appealed and continued to run Enterprise Diamond before it was inspected by Ofsted in March 2016 and served with a warning notice for running an unregistered school. She closed the school shortly after. There is no suggestion any child was harmed at the school. \"I never set out to do anything illegal,\" Johnston says. \"I was threatened with a jail sentence for rescuing vulnerable children who have been given up on by mainstream schools, caring for them, educating them at my own expense.\" One mother, whose son and daughter both attended, says she chose to educate them there because she was unhappy with the alternatives offered by the state. Pupil referral units in the area are \"a pipeline to failure\", she says, leading to a life of crime. Safeguarding alerts\nThe BBC has learned that local authorities across England and Wales have received 52 safeguarding alerts - concerns or suspicions of abuse or neglect - since January 2014 from unregistered schools. The majority of reports concerned allegations of physical abuse, but alerts were also made about sexual abuse and grooming. Alerts were received across England, with one in Wales. None were reported in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Legal confusion\nWhen Ofsted finds a suspected unregistered school, they can only issue a warning notice and seek to prosecute the individual running the school. The Department for Education has to approve this, then evidence is passed to the Crown Prosecution Service, before the education secretary is given the final decision to proceed. \"It takes an inordinately long time and [lots of] resources,\" says Victor Shafiee, Ofsted\u0027s deputy director for unregistered schools. \"It\u0027s not good enough.\" Ofsted has limited investigative powers - it is not allowed to take away any evidence, enter premises with locked doors or call witnesses to be interviewed. Despite investigating 359 suspected unregistered schools, it has yet to secure a single prosecution against a proprietor for running one. Ofsted Chief Inspector Amanda Spielman says that her \"hands are tied\" and that the DfE \"could and should\" have approved cases to be put forward to the CPS. The DfE says it works very closely with Ofsted and jointly agrees which cases are sent to the Crown Prosecution Service. \"The CPS then determine whether the evidential and public interest tests are met. If the Director of Public Prosecutions takes a decision to charge, the case then comes to the secretary of state for his consent. So far no cases have reached that stage. \"No child should be placed at risk and where a school is operating illegally action must be taken. We fund a joint team with Ofsted to target these organisations and as a result of that, 192 inspections have taken place and 50 warning notices have been issued. \"Thirty-eight unregistered schools have subsequently ceased to operate as schools and investigations are ongoing into the remainder.\" Ofsted says there is anecdotal evidence of some places opening on new sites. Shafiee says a change in the law is needed to shut these places down when inspectors visit them. Ministers have regularly been warned about the issue. Ed Balls was told about the problem of unregistered schools in Hackney by civil servants when he was the education secretary in 2009. The civil servants said yeshivas were \"operating illegally and without the most basic health, safety and child welfare checks\". Then in 2014, details of a dozen unregistered schools in London were sent to the department, then led by Michael Gove. His successor, Nicky Morgan, was also alerted to the issue in a confidential advice note from 2015. \"Her Majesty\u0027s Chief Inspector is very concerned that the children and young people attending these unregistered schools are potentially at risk,\" it said. \"It is of utmost importance that urgent action is taken to ensure that they are kept safe and receive a suitable education.\" In October 2015, it looked as if change was afoot. In his party conference speech, Prime Minister David Cameron announced plans to introduce greater regulation of what he called supplementary schools. \"These children should be having their minds opened, their horizons broadened, not having their heads filled with poison and their hearts filled with hate,\" he said. \"If an institution is teaching children intensively, then whatever its religion, we will, like any other school, make it register so it can be inspected.\" But Cameron\u0027s promise never materialised. One of the reasons for the failure to act is understood to have been the objections raised by the Church of England. New proposals would have allowed Ofsted powers over any place supervising pupils for more than eight hours a week. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, believed the measures would impose a burden on even the smallest church Sunday schools. But the BBC understands there may be another reason for the DfE\u0027s reluctance to act. We have seen legal guidance from 2014 known to have been cited by the DfE. The guidance suggests the DfE would lose in court if there was an attempt to close an unregistered Jewish yeshiva. Daniel Greenberg QC, acting for a yeshiva, argued that somewhere providing only \"specialised religious education\" did not count as a school because it offers no secular teaching whatsoever. The DfE makes a distinction between \"unregistered schools\" and \"out-of-school settings\". In the latter it includes \"full-time settings that only teach a religious curriculum, and therefore do not qualify as schools\". Dame Louise Casey - who led a review of community cohesion in 2016 - says it\u0027s a \"crazy policy\" for the DfE to have. \"We do not want kids growing up here who are only taught one religious way of thinking, and that religion covers their whole way of life from what they can work as, who they can be, what kind of jobs they can do, how they treat women. \"Even if it\u0027s technically legal, it\u0027s wrong.\" If you have any information or experience with unregistered schools that you are willing to share with the BBC you can get in touch with us at haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk Your details and any information you send will be treated in confidence.

Carlos Tavares, chief executive of PSA, which owns Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroen, said clarity over the terms of the UK\u0027s departure was \"a big concern\". He told the BBC that uncertainty undermined Ellesmere Port\u0027s chances of getting more work after 2021. \"We cannot invest in a world of uncertainty,\" he said. He added: \"No one is going to make huge investments without knowing what will be the final competitiveness of the Brexit outcome.\" Speaking to the BBC at the Geneva Motor Show, Mr Tavares said the decision on whether or not to give Ellesmere more work would need to be taken \"very soon\". A spokesperson for the government\u0027s Business Department said: \"The Business Secretary [Greg Clark] has met with Vauxhall\u0027s senior management team on a number of occasions to understand their plans for their Ellesmere Port plant. \"The government is continuing to engage with PSA on their future strategic plans for the UK. \" The general secretary of the Unite union, Len McCluskey, said: \"Of course, the government position on Brexit is creating uncertainty for major manufacturing companies but this should not be used by Mr Tavares to raise the fear of closure of Ellesmere Port. \"The UK market is vitally important to Peugeot and if he wants to protect that market share he should openly commit to new models in both Ellesmere Port and Luton. \"Our Vauxhall plants are among the most productive in the PSA family, and the products our members make are among the most popular vehicles in the country.\" Vauxhall chief warns over Brexit Mr Tavares said: \"I would like to praise our UK people in terms of their efficiency, but at the same time we need clarity. \"This is not a problem for the PSA Group, this is a problem for the whole UK automotive industry.\" PSA said last year it was committed to keep making the Astra at Ellesmere Port, but it has also said that manufacturing costs at Ellesmere are higher than other plants it owns. However, it said in January that it was cutting another 250 jobs at Ellesmere Port on top of 400 cuts it announced in October. Vauxhall employs about 4,500 people in the UK, with about 1,800 at Ellesmere Port. The company also has a factory at Luton, which makes vans. In August last year, PSA became Europe\u0027s second-biggest carmaker, after Volkswagen, when it completed the purchase of Vauxhall and German brand Opel from General Motors.

Mr Flowers was chairman of the bank at the time of its near collapse in 2013 when it revealed a £1.5bn black hole in its accounts. The FCA found he had used his work email for sexually explicit messages, and to discuss illegal drugs. He left amid concerns about expenses and in 2014 admitted drug possession. Using the email provided by the Co-op for such communication was in breach of its workplace guidelines and Mr Flowers continued such usage despite having been warned not to previously. He also used his Co-op mobile phone to call premium rate chat lines. \u0027Trust and influence\u0027\nThe FCA said he had \"demonstrated a lack of fitness and propriety required to work in financial services\" and consumers would lose faith in the industry if he was allowed to continue in it. Mark Steward, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said: \"The role of chair occupies a unique place of trust and influence. The chair is pivotal in setting expectations of a company\u0027s culture, values and behaviours. \"Mr Flowers failed in his duty to lead by example and to meet the high standards of integrity and probity demanded by the role. These high standards are what the financial services industry and the wider community rightly expect of its senior individuals.\" The FCA said its investigation had taken so long partly because of its need to be thorough, but also because, in this case, it had to wait until other investigations into the collapse of the bank itself and the conduct of other executives were well under way. In 2016, the Bank of England\u0027s Prudential Regulation Authority banned two former Co-operative Bank executives from holding senior banking positions. It also fined them. Dramatic change\nThe Treasury has now also announced it has launched a new independent review into the way the Co-op Bank was supervised between 2008 and 2013. It said its investigation had had to wait until the FCA\u0027s one had ended. Its independent review will look at the \"actions, policies and approach\" of the former City watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, and the current one, the Prudential Regulation Authority. In the period under review, the bank changed dramatically. It merged with the Britannia building society in 2009. That deal was later held responsible for the near collapse of the bank. In 2013, it tried and failed to buy 632 branches from Lloyds. ","date":1520332200000,"topics":["UK Banking","Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)","Co-operative Bank","Companies","Banking"]}

The six people, led by Peter Hall and including his wife Claire, operated websites that impersonated official government services. They then sold key documents to people for inflated prices. The illegal profits were used to fund luxury holidays and cars. Mike Andrews, lead co-ordinator of the eCrime team at National Trading Standards, which investigated the fraud, said: \"This was a crime motivated by greed. This group defrauded people so they could enjoy a luxury lifestyle. \"They showed no regard for the unnecessary costs they imposed on their victims - I would say they treated them with contempt.\" National Trading Standards said that the defendants set up copycat websites between January 2011 and November 2014 that mimicked government services such as applying for or renewing passports, visas, birth or death certificates, driving licences and tests, car tax discs and the London Congestion Charge. The group also set up sites that copied the American, Turkish, Cambodian, Vietnamese and Sri Lankan official visa sites where people could apply and pay for electronic visas to visit those countries. National Trading Standards said that in all cases the sites offered little or no additional value to consumers using them, adding that it is believed Indian, Turkish and US citizens have also been defrauded. It said that the \"illegal profits funded a glamorous lifestyle for the defendants\". At one point, Claire Hall was preparing to buy a house for £1.4m when the authorities intervened. Mr and Mrs Hall were arrested on 27 June 2014. The National Trading Standards eCrime team and the police raided properties across Hampshire. Mr Hall, aged 47, was sentenced to a total of 15 years following two trials which took place in July 2017 and March this year. In the first trial, His Honour Judge Sean Morris said: \"Mr Hall was a highly manipulative and controlling individual and it was a determined, sophisticated long running fraud. He was a charming man but did not charm the jury. \"We live in a computer age, and crime is developing to meet that age. People live by their computers and need to know that the services they purchase online are genuine services.\" Mr Andrews said: \"I would urge people to always use the GOV.UK website when looking to apply for any kind of government service such as a passport, driving licence or EHIC card. \"Search engines may seem the easiest route but searching using the GOV.UK website is the safest way of ensuring you do not fall victim to a copycat website.\" Lord Toby Harris, chairman of National Trading Standards, said: \"I would urge members of the public to report any copycat websites they spot to the Citizens Advice consumer service by calling 03454 04 05 06.\" ","date":1520368276000,"topics":[]}

McDonald\u0027s is looking to improve food quality and ward off competition from premium burger chains. Burgers containing fresh beef will be sold at most of the chain\u0027s 14,000 US restaurants by the end of June. McDonald\u0027s UK business said: \"We will watch what happens in the US and see if this innovation is something we should consider in the UK. \"Our patties are made from 100% British and Irish beef with nothing added aside from a little salt and pepper after cooking.\" McDonald\u0027s UK said that its beef patties were still cooked from frozen in its restaurants using \"a process perfected over decades\". Need for speed\nThe move to fresh beef is part of bigger changes at McDonald\u0027s, as new competitors, including burger chains such as Shake Shack, become a bigger part of the fast-food market, using fresh ingredients to differentiate themselves. As part of its turnaround efforts in recent years, McDonald\u0027s has tweaked pricing and added to its menu. It has also ditched ingredients such as high fructose corn syrup in a bid to appeal to health-conscious customers. \"McDonald\u0027s is certainly responding to industry pressure, consumer pressure to make the change,\" said David Henkes, a senior principal at Technomic, a restaurant research consulting company. \"It\u0027s part and parcel of what they\u0027ve been trying to do to create a different perception of McDonald\u0027s.\" The firm has been testing the appetite for burgers made from fresh beef for about a year. The premium quarter pounder and other offerings are now available at about 3,500 McDonald\u0027s restaurants in the US, including in Miami, Orlando and Nashville. These products are sold alongside existing burgers made using frozen meat. Over the next month, fresh beef burgers will become available at restaurants in Los Angeles, Houston and San Francisco. McDonald\u0027s US president Chris Kempczinski said that offering fresh beef was the most significant change to the restaurant chain\u0027s menu since it started offering all-day breakfast in 2015. To keep service speedy, McDonald\u0027s had to make changes to its suppliers and kitchen crews. \"If it slows down the drive-through, that\u0027s the critical part of our business. And so we just had to spend a lot of time really making sure that as we were cooking only when someone ordered, we\u0027d figured out a way to do it that wasn\u0027t going to slow down service time,\" said Mr Kempczinski.

The EU has drawn up a target list of 100 US goods worth €2.8bn ($3.5bn, £2.5bn), the BBC understands. The list, which also includes cosmetics, agricultural and industrial goods, was circulated to the 28 EU member governments on Monday. EU commissioners are expected to discuss the proposals on Wednesday. The EU list includes: Many of the products the EU has in its sights are specifically chosen to have maximum political effect. Bourbon whiskey is produced in Kentucky, the state of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. Orange juice is a key export for Florida, a swing state in the US elections. Several US companies such as Levi Strauss have already come out strongly against trade barriers. On Monday, it said: \"Unilateral tariff impositions risk retaliation and destabilizing the global economy, in which case American brands, workers and consumers will ultimately suffer.\" What is the EU considering?\nOn Monday, the EU Commissioner for Trade, Cecilia Malmström, told the BBC: \"We are looking at possibilities to retaliate, meaning we will also put taxes or tariffs on US imports to the European Union.\" She said that if the US went ahead and applied taxes to European steel, the EU would take the issue to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Ms Malmström stressed that Europe was looking to respond \"to retaliate but not escalate\". But President Trump has already threatened more retaliation. On Saturday he tweeted:: \"If the EU wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on US companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the US.\" What does Trump want to do and why?\nMr Trump has decried the \"$800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our \u0027very stupid\u0027 trade deals and policies\", and vowed to end it. On Thursday, he said steel imports would face a 25% tariff and aluminium 10%. Then came Saturday\u0027s threat on EU-made cars. The United States has an $800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our “very stupid” trade deals and policies. Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years. They laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more! End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump In January, he had already announced tariffs on solar panels and washing machines. What are US\u0027s trading partners making of this?\nDowning Street said that during Mrs May\u0027s call to President Trump on Sunday she raised \"our deep concern at the President\u0027s forthcoming announcement on steel and aluminium tariffs, noting that multilateral action was the only way to resolve the problem of global overcapacity in all parties\u0027 interests.\" Zhang Yesui, spokesperson for China\u0027s National People\u0027s Congress, said it was natural that \"some friction will exist\" between the US and China, given the volume of trade between them surpassed $580bn (£420bn) last year. But he said China would take \"necessary measures\" if its interests were hurt. Canada said tariffs would cause disruption on both sides of the border. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was \"confident we\u0027re going to continue to be able to defend Canadian industry\". Brazil, Mexico and Japan, that have said they will consider retaliatory steps if the president presses ahead with his plan. Has Trump got political support at home for a trade war?\nA number of Republicans have questioned the wisdom of the tariff proposal and have been urging the president to reconsider. US Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has said he is \"extremely worried\" about the impact of a trade war, adding that it could undermine economic gains. Senator Orrin Hatch said American citizens would be made to pay, while Senator Ben Sasse agreed that \"kooky 18th Century protectionism will jack up prices on American families\". Jason Furman, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama, told the BBC the proposed tariffs were \"a very costly and inefficient way to help a small number of people\". \"This could be bad or awful, there\u0027s no scenario under which it\u0027s good,\" he added. Industry bodies such as the US Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association have expressed deep concern. But steelworkers in Pennsylvania and Indiana will welcome Mr Trump\u0027s comments. Is there room for compromise?\nPresident Trump hinted on Monday that if the US achieved a better deal for itself in the latest North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) he would abandon plans for a tariff on Canada\u0027s and Mexico\u0027s steel imports. We have large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada. NAFTA, which is under renegotiation right now, has been a bad deal for U.S.A. Massive relocation of companies \u0026 jobs. Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new \u0026 fair NAFTA agreement is signed. Also, Canada must.. End of Twitter post 2 by @realDonaldTrump The rest of the tweet is a reference to Canada and US farmers. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin repeated that idea before a congressional panel on Tuesday, saying that he expects Mexico and Canada to be exempt from the tariffs, assuming NAFTA negotiations are successful. Substantial changes to the Nafta agreement are not likely to happen soon, however. The current round of Nafta talks, about updating the 24-year-old treaty, finished on Monday with little progress. Mr Trump has previously threatened to withdraw the United States from the pact. Is Trump right about the trade imbalance?\nThe US imports steel from more than 100 nations and brings in four times more steel from abroad than it exports. Since 2000, the US steel industry has suffered, with production dropping and the number of employees in steel work falling. The US is the largest export market for EU cars - making up 25% of the €192bn (£171bn; $237bn) worth of motor vehicles the bloc exported in 2016 (China was second with 16%).

From Tuesday, the three-year Growth Bond will only pay 1.95%, compared with 2.2% under the previous issue. The three-year Income Bond will pay 1.9%, down from 2.15%. The rate on the one-year version of both products will remain unchanged. NS\u0026I said they had proved too popular since their launch in December. At the time they were near the top of the best buy tables, although they have since been overtaken by other savings products. The change will only affect new savers. Those who already hold the three-year Growth Bond and Income Bond will not be affected. The rate cut is in contrast to some banks and building societies, which have slowly been increasing their savings rates, in expectation of further base rate rises. However, NS\u0026I is set a specific fund-raising target by the Treasury, and that target was reduced in the Autumn Budget to £8bn. \u0027Disappointing\u0027 move\n\"Demand for the bonds in the first three months has been high,\" said Jill Waters, retail director of NS\u0026I. \"It is always a difficult decision to reduce rates but these changes will allow us to manage demand in order to achieve our net financing target, while continuing to deliver positive value to taxpayers.\" Anyone who has an existing three year Growth Bond will be able to roll it over for a further three years at the previous rate of 2.2%. Holders of so-called Pensioner Bonds - launched in 2015 - have their savings put into Growth Bonds when the three-year period expires, unless they choose another option. They too will be able to access the previous rate. Anna Bowes, director of the website Savings Champion, said: \"While it\u0027s disappointing to see a rate from this very popular provider reduce for new customers, it\u0027s not wholly unexpected, as the rate was very competitive. \"The good news is that those with maturing 65+ Guaranteed Growth Bonds will still have access to the old product offering 2.2%, for those who want to roll their funds over for another three years.\" Investment Guaranteed Growth Bonds - a separate product sold online - will continue to be on sale until 10 April. They also pay 2.2%. In the meantime savers can find better returns elsewhere. Currently the Swedish bank Ikano offers 2.26% on a three year bond, while Vanquis Bank offers 2.25%.

The company said sales and profits had fallen for the first time in 13 years, blaming the weak performance on having to sell off excess stock cheaply. A Lego spokeswoman said it had \"too much\" stock in warehouses and shops. \"There wasn\u0027t enough room to get 2017 toys into the stores, and the toy trade is driven by newness,\" she added. The Danish toymaker said dealing with the stock issue, as well as a drop in sales in Europe and North America, had dragged down its performance last year. Lego Group chief executive Niels Christiansen said there was \"no quick fix\" and it would take the firm \"some time\" to grow long-term. The weak performance comes after Lego cut 1,400 jobs worldwide in September, saying its business needed a \"reset\". Revenue for 2017 dropped by 8% to 35bn Danish kroner (£4.2bn; $5.8bn), compared to 37.9bn kroner in 2016. Pre-tax profits slid 18% to 10.4bn kroner in 2017. \"During the year, revenues declined, however consumer sales - or sales in stores - remained flat. This shows that consumers (kids and their parents) are continuing to buy from retailers,\" said Lego\u0027s spokeswoman. Lego in numbers\n\"2017 was a challenging year and overall we are not satisfied with the financial results,\" Mr Christiansen said. However, he said the firm\u0027s performance had improved towards the end of the year, with sales growing in seven of its 12 largest markets in December. The company has been increasing sales in new markets, particularly in Asia. Lego said that it saw \"strong potential\" in its business in China, where sales enjoyed double digit growth last year. \"However, to reduce retail inventories, we shipped less to our retailers than what the consumers are buying.\" \"We started 2018 in better shape and during the coming year we will stabilise the business by continuing to invest in great products, effective global marketing and improved execution,\" said Mr Christiansen. In September, Lego said its half-year results had suffered because it had stretched itself too thin by diversifying into products that were not toys, such as the Lego movies. Lego chairman Jorgen Knudstorp said at the time that adding complexity to the company had made it harder for the toymaker to grow further. He said that the firm had pressed \"the reset button\" for the group with the aim of building \"a smaller and less complex organisation\". ","date":1520342761000,"topics":["Lego","Companies"]}

The letter, led by Labour MP Jack Dromey and Conservative MP Rachel Maclean, is the latest sign of worry over the deal. Melrose Industries has offered £7.4bn for the 259 year-old firm. The Pensions Regulator has warned that the move could affect the company\u0027s ability to fund its pension scheme. GKN is defending itself against the approach from Melrose, a firm that specialises in buying up industrial companies it believes are undervalued and restructuring them before selling them on. That has raised fears that GKN, one of the UK\u0027s largest industrial firms, will be broken up and sold to overseas owners. There are also worries over the level of additional debt GKN would take on if the takeover goes ahead. The letter from the cross-party group of MPs says: \"GKN is one of the most prominent engineering firms in the UK, the third biggest in our country. It is a world class success story, the pride of British industry which supplies components to companies such as Jaguar Land Rover. \"We are writing to you because we all have a GKN plant and/or supply chain-affected firm in our constituencies. Due to this, we have shared our concerns about the proposed hostile takeover bid by Melrose and want to express to you why we believe the takeover should not succeed.\" Pension worries\nBosses of both companies are due before a parliamentary committee on Tuesday as the battle over GKN intensifies. Ahead of the hearing, the Work and Pensions Committee published a letter from the Pensions Regulator expressing concern over whether Melrose\u0027s takeover would weaken GKN\u0027s position in fulfilling its pension obligations. The Pensions Regulator said: \"From the outset we have been concerned that the increased leverage involved in the proposed takeover by Melrose is likely to have a detrimental impact on covenant\". \"Covenant\" refers to the company\u0027s ability to fulfil its current and future pension obligations. The MPs\u0027 letter also expresses strong concern about the impact of any deal on the pension scheme. It says they are worried that: \"Melrose may well try to undertake a packaged administration when it sells off constituent parts of the company, and send the fund to the Pension Protection Fund, passing the responsibility to others, ensuring it no longer shoulders its responsibilities, and cutting its payroll costs\". Melrose says that it has a history of improving company pension schemes, rather than running them down. \"Melrose has consistently strengthened the pension scheme covenants of the businesses that it has acquired. Every time we have disposed of a business we have left the business free from deficit. \"We have also stated that we will improve the position of GKN pensioners, making a £150 million cash contribution to the GKN pension schemes.\" Companies involved in takeovers can submit details of their plans to the Pensions Regulator and obtain clearance if the regulator is satisfied that they are putting sufficient mitigating measures in place. However, applying for clearance is voluntary. The Work and Pensions Committee\u0027s chair, Frank Field, said he thought pensioners would be surprised to hear that a pension scheme could be transferred to a new owner without the Pensions Regulator having a say. He called for the introduction of mandatory clearance checks for such cases. GKN\u0027s defined benefits pension scheme has 32,000 members including 17,000 who have already retired. It has a deficit of £1.1bn, despite an additional contribution of £250m made into the scheme last October. A brief history of GKN\nFounded in 1759 as an ironworks in South Wales Involved in aerospace, automotive, materials and manufacturing engineering Operates in 30 countries with 59,000 employees Employs 6,000 staff in the UK, mostly in aerospace and automotive technology Ten UK sites, including Bristol, Cowes, Luton, Portsmouth, Birmingham and Telford. Chief executive Anne Stephens took over in January GKN raised the issue of its pension scheme in January, arguing the takeover would put future pension security at risk. Melrose defended itself saying it had \"a long track record of responsibly funding pension schemes\" and said there was no cause for GKN pensioners to be concerned. Melrose also said it had offered to make a voluntary cash contribution of up to £150m into GKN\u0027s pension schemes when it first made a bid for the firm.

Italian chain Carluccio\u0027s has joined a lengthening list of chains losing the battle against higher costs and increased competition. The deli to dining brand has called in accountants KPMG to advise on possible strategies. Prezzo, Jamie\u0027s Italian, Byron and others have already announced closures. A boom in casual dining a few years ago, has given way to dog-eat-dog competition as the now crowded sector faces higher costs and faltering consumer appetites. \"There is little respite on the horizon\" according to Peter Kubik, partner in the London office of UHY Hacker Young which conducted the research. UHY Hacker Young says last year 20 of the top 100 restaurant groups were loss-making. This year it is 35. Which chains are struggling?\nCarluccio\u0027s and KPMG are tight-lipped over exactly what options are under discussion. But it\u0027s another sign that the old certainty - you can always make dough from selling pizza - no longer holds true. Other Italian-style eateries are already facing the music: Prezzo is closing 94 outlets, Jamie\u0027s Italian is shutting 12 branches and Strada 11. With so many Italians on the High Street from Pizza Express and Zizzi to small independents, this part of the market is saturated, says Stefan Chomka, editor of Restaurant magazine. And the same goes for mid-market burger chains. \"Every town pretty much has a decent place to get a burger whereas ten years ago they didn\u0027t and so they\u0027ve experienced some of the fall out from that,\" he says. Byron is in the process of restructuring and is likely to close 20 of its 67 branches. Who is still succeeding?\n\"Wagamama does pretty well,\" says Mr Chomka. \"Likewise Nando\u0027s is a fascinating success story.\" Both chains, he says face less direct competition from similar brands. \"[Nando\u0027s] goes up against the KFC\u0027s of this world but its not a KFC. It\u0027s a proper sit down dining experience. It\u0027s great for young people. So it\u0027s doing really well.\" Another that\u0027s bucking the trend he says is Franco Manca. It\u0027s Italian, but it is cheaper than Pizza Express et al and also appeals to a younger crowd. \"It has grown phenomenally in the last three or four years as people have moved from larger chains towards some of the smaller chains,\" says Mr Chomka. Why are times so tough?\nThere are a number of things says Peter Kubik at UHY Hacker Young that are preventing the numbers adding up for restaurant chains. The fall in sterling since the referendum vote has pushed up the cost of any imported ingredients whether that\u0027s mozzarella or meat, olives or avocado. And staff pay is going up too. \"The government has ratcheted up costs with a series of above-inflation rises in the minimum wage, and we are just weeks away from another 4.4% rise in April,\" says Mr Kubik. \"That will be tough for a lot of restaurants to absorb.\" Mr Kubik says \"Brexit hanging over consumers like a dark cloud\" means people are more reluctant to splash out. Will Wright, KPMG\u0027s restructuring partner responsible for Byron\u0027s recent deal with its creditors, adds in rising business rates and the burden of debt being born by a lot of the chains - the result of a flurry in merger and acquisition activity that has left some stuck with the wrong sites in the wrong areas. \"As restructuring practice we\u0027ve never been as busy as we have been in last few months in this sector,\" he says. Are we eating out less?\nThere are certain fashionable city centre places, where if you turn up at the wrong time you can still end up queuing for a table. For example cafes offering highly \u0027Instagramable\u0027 weekend brunches. There is still a buoyant market for places that get the offer right, according to Deloitte. But consumer spending power, squeezed by low wage growth and higher inflation, means consumers are reining in discretionary leisure spending in general, and that includes spending less at restaurants. Some are replacing it with home delivered meals, or ready-meals like Marks and Spencer\u0027s successful Dine In for Two for £10. Some restaurants have responded with ever more aggressive discounting; Deloitte found 38% of visits involve a deal or special offer. But of course, in terms of profitability that only makes things worse. How much will change?\nSarah Humphreys, lead partner for casual dining at Deloitte, thinks the current spate of closures is \"a blip\" and that before long we\u0027ll be back on the long term trend of a booming market for meals out. \"If you look forward ten years... we will be eating out more often,\" she says. But the current squeeze means in the meantime we\u0027re likely to notice changes on the High Street this year, says Mr Wright at KPMG, whether just because the less profitable branches are gone or whether whole chains end up disappearing. \"It\u0027s a very fast moving sector. New concepts are what it\u0027s all about. Businesses need to stay very relevant and to do that they need to spend money on their sites to keep them fresh,\" he says. Ms Humphreys and the team at Deloitte think reduced margins now will focus minds on improving productivity and investing in new technology like pre-ordering, mobile payments and customisable menus that appeal to younger customers. The future she says will be all about giving customers a better experience, and points to concept restaurants like Bounce which offers meals and ping-pong side-by-side; or food alongside crazy golf, or music. \"It\u0027s about making it an experience: something with drama and pizzazz,\" she says.

Severn Trent said it had worked \"round the clock\" to fix water supply problems caused by the big thaw. \"We\u0027d like to thank the few businesses we\u0027ve been working with over the past couple of days for all of their help,\" it said. \"It is our normal procedure to work proactively with a handful of large businesses who use a lot of water to manage their usage when we need to prioritise customer supplies. \"It enables us to make sure we have enough water for households and vulnerable customers including hospitals and care homes.\" The water supplier said it had ramped up production at its treatment works and used tankers to support local hospitals. On Monday evening, Jaguar Land Rover said workers at its Solihull plant had been sent home. The company employs 11,000 people at the Solihull site in the West Midlands, which operates a pattern of three shifts a day from Monday morning through to Saturday morning. The plant produces 300,000 vehicles a year. Cadbury owner Mondelez had said on Monday that it had limited water supply to its site in Bournville and some manufacturing was running, but maintained that it had enough stock. It had earlier told workers to leave and work from home where possible. Severn Trent covers a large region from mid-Wales to Rutland, and from the Humber down to the Bristol Channel. The water supplier said it had seen nearly a 4,000% increase in reports of burst pipes due to the big thaw. ","date":1520320498000,"topics":["Birmingham","Severn Trent","Severe weather","Companies"]}

US Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said he was \"extremely worried\" about the impact of a trade war, adding that it could undermine economic gains. But Mr Trump pushed back during a White House meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \"We\u0027re not backing down,\" he told reporters on Monday. \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027re going to have a trade war,\" he said. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Monday that President Trump was \"very confident\" the US would win any trade war. Mr Trump\u0027s Monday comments came an hour after Mr Ryan released a statement urging the White House to reconsider its plan. \"We are extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war and are urging the White House to not advance with this plan,\" Mr Ryan\u0027s spokeswoman AshLee Strong said. \"The new tax reform law has boosted the economy and we certainly don\u0027t want to jeopardise those gains.\" Mr Trump\u0027s announcement last week that he would tax imported steel and aluminium has prompted worldwide reaction. The World Trade Organization (WTO) on Monday also called on member states to \"stop the fall of the first dominoes\" of a trade war. \"Once we start down this path it will be very difficult to reverse direction,\" WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo told negotiators in Geneva on Monday. \"An eye for an eye will leave us all blind and the world in a deep recession.\" What does Trump want to do and why?\nEarlier on Monday, Mr Trump hinted that if the US achieved a better deal for itself in the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) he would abandon plans for tariffs on US neighbours. We are on the losing side of almost all trade deals. Our friends and enemies have taken advantage of the U.S. for many years. Our Steel and Aluminum industries are dead. Sorry, it’s time for a change! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump Those tariffs could be removed for Canada and Mexico if they signed a \"new and fair\" agreement, he suggested. The current round of Nafta talks, which focus on updating the 24-year old treaty, are due to finish on Monday and have achieved little. Mr Trump has decried the US trade deficit with other countries, which he has blamed on \"\u0027very stupid\u0027 trade deals and policies\". On Thursday, he said steel imports would face a 25% tariff and aluminium 10%. He issued a threat against EU-made cars on Saturday, which he repeated during his Oval Office meeting with the Israeli prime minister on Monday. \"They have trade barriers that are worse than tariffs. They also have tariffs by the way, but they have trade barriers far worse than tariffs.\" \"And if they want to do something we\u0027ll just tax their cars that they send in here like water,\" he vowed. The United States has an $800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our “very stupid” trade deals and policies. Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years. They laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more! End of Twitter post 2 by @realDonaldTrump Has Trump got political support at home for a trade war?\nOver the weekend some Republicans began to question the tariff proposal and have urged the president to reconsider. Many argue that the impact of tax cuts that were passed earlier this year will be wiped out as countries levy new tariffs on US goods and the price of metals climbs. Senator Orrin Hatch said American citizens would be made to pay, adding that Mr Trump\u0027s \"action could very well undercut the benefits of the pro-growth tax reform we fought to get on the books\". Senator Ben Sasse agreed that \"kooky 18th Century protectionism will jack up prices on American families\". Responding to the criticism on CNN, White House economic adviser Peter Navarro dismissed the number of Republicans opposed Mr Trump\u0027s tariff plan. \"Guess what: He beat them,\" Mr Navarro said, referring to the outcome of the 2016 election. He added that Republicans are \"dead wrong on the economics\". Industry bodies like the US Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association have expressed deep concern. How has the EU responded to the tariff threat?\nLevi jeans and bourbon could be hit with a 25% import tax by the European Union if Mr Trump imposes tariffs on European steel and aluminium. Cecilia Malmström, EU Commissioner for Trade, told the BBC the items were on a draft list of US goods to be taxed. Ms Malmström told the BBC: \"We are looking at possibilities to retaliate, meaning we will also put taxes or tariffs on US imports to the European Union.\" What do US trading partners make of this?\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had \"forcefully defended\" Canadian industry in a phone call to Mr Trump on Monday, his office said. A spokesman described the conversation as \"constructive\" but gave no details. Canada has warned that tariffs would cause disruption on both sides of the border. Downing Street said that during Mrs May\u0027s call to President Trump on Sunday she raised \"our deep concern at the president\u0027s forthcoming announcement on steel and aluminium tariffs, noting that multilateral action was the only way to resolve the problem of global overcapacity in all parties\u0027 interests\". Zhang Yesui, spokesperson for China\u0027s National People\u0027s Congress, said it was natural that \"some friction will exist\" between the US and China, given the volume of trade between them surpassed $580bn (£420bn) last year. But he said China would take \"necessary measures\" if its interests were hurt. EU trade chiefs could apply 25% tariffs on about $3.5bn of imports from the US - targeting iconic US exports including Levi\u0027s jeans, Harley-Davidson motorbikes and bourbon whiskey. Brazil, Mexico and Japan have said they will consider retaliatory steps if the president presses ahead with his plan next week. The move has also been strongly criticised by the International Monetary Fund and the WTO. Is Trump right about the trade imbalance?\nThe US imports steel from more than 100 nations and brings in four times more steel from abroad than it exports. Since 2000, the US steel industry has suffered, with production dropping and the number of employees in steel work falling. The US is the largest export market for EU cars - making up 25% of the €192bn (£171bn; $237bn) worth of motor vehicles the bloc exported in 2016 (China was second with 16%).

{"hash":"54a98f8e59d07f64e5855b3bc787633b","title":"The handbag that costs as much as a house","author":"bbc","feed":"business","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43239037","content":"How much is a handbag worth? Say £100? Maybe £500? Perhaps even £1,000? How about handing over $380,000 (£279,000) for one bag - and a second-hand one at that? For that price, you could buy a house in the UK (where the average dwelling costs £223,285, according to the Halifax) and still have plenty left over. Yet astonishingly last year someone did pay that amount of money for a rare 2014 Himalaya Birkin - a matte white handbag by Hermes. You may also like:\nIt was fashioned from Nilo crocodile hide and adorned with 18-carat white gold and diamond-encrusted details. While £279,000 is a record breaking price tag for this \"holy grail\" of handbags, it is a drop in the ocean when it comes to the increasingly lucrative market for buying and selling pre-owned luxury \"arm furniture\". High-end bags have come a long way from the days when Princess Grace of Monaco used an Hermes Sac a depeches to hide her growing baby bump from the paparazzi. It was subsequently renamed the Kelly bag after the former Hollywood star. Expensive handbags are now ubiquitous among celebrities such as reality TV personalities Kim Kardashian West and her mother Kris Jenner. However, these bags are no frivolous trinkets. Auction house Christie\u0027s says the global pre-owned luxury handbag market has jumped from being worth £5.1m in 2011 to £26m in 2016. Heritage Auctions believes that the worldwide secondary auction market for the \"ultra high-end bags\" is between $75m and $100m \"and growing\". In investment terms, these assets can offer a huge return on your cash. Investment bank Jefferies reckons that some bags can generate returns of about 30% a year. Handbags made by Hermes, the French luxury goods house, are the most sought-after. Rachel Koffsky, a specialist in handbags and accessories at Christie\u0027s, says Hermes handbags \"have been crafted in the same way, in the same materials for decades, whereas many other brands have been inconsistent in production over the past 100 years\". She adds that the three best-known bags - the Kelly, the Birkin, made for the singer and actress Jane Birkin, and the Constance, named after the fifth child of Hermes designer Catherine Chaillet - \"have remained virtually unchanged since they were designed\". However, Jefferies says: \"Over the past 10 to 20 years, luxury brands have increasingly been able to raise the prices of their handbags and use more premium materials so in the future the top of the market is likely to become less dominated by Hermès.\" Heritage Auctions says that as well as Hermes, Chanel\u0027s iconic flap bags \"are always favourites for the paparazzi to catch on the celebrity arms of the world\u0027s most famous\". Ms Koffsky adds that, in the 1990s, two designers in particular were responsible for ushering in the \"era of the It-bag\" - Tom Ford at Gucci and Marc Jacobs at Louis Vuitton. These, along with the characters in the TV series Sex and the City, \"brought collectable handbags into the mainstream\". It also means that the somewhat intimidating world of auction houses is opening up to a different kind of clientele. Ms Koffsky says: \"Handbags have a very wide appeal and is a category most consumers are more comfortable with when compared to traditional flat or even decorative art.\" Jefferies says that handbags are the \"most accessible category\" at Christie\u0027s because of the lower cost of the lots, adding that 40% of the 712 buyers in that category were new to the auction house. Heritage Auctions says that there is no typical buyer. They can range from people who want to add to their existing handbag collection - or those who would like to start one. Ms Koffsky says quite often buyers become sellers and vice versa. She says: \"At the top end of the buyer spectrum, we have collectors who count their handbags among their most valuable assets. On the other end, we have young and savvy shoppers looking for a vintage piece that will stand out from current trends, oftentimes it is significantly less than retail. \"Perhaps it is their first time buying at auction.\" However, while handbags have attracted a new clientele, it isn\u0027t a world open to everyone. A new Kelly or Birkin bag can cost about £7,000 each - if you can get your hands on one - while a new Chanel classic mini flap bag costs $3,300 (£2,392). Choosing a second-hand bag may snag a buyer a bargain but these are not accessories within everyone\u0027s grasp. Flavio Cereda, an analyst at Jefferies, says that Hong Kong has become a hot spot for high-end handbags. Forbes recently reported that the combined wealth of Hong Kong\u0027s billionaires soared by $60bn to $307bn last year - the biggest rise for a Forbes Asia 50 list. Christie\u0027s said 46% of its luxury handbag auction sales were in Asia in 2017, followed by the US at 30% while Europe, the Middle East and Africa accounted for 24%. It is no coincidence that those two rare Himalaya Birkins bags were auctioned in Hong Kong. These are the type of handbags that make good investments, says Ms Koffsky. \"For a positive return on investment, numbered and limited edition pieces will stand out as they are only created in a very limited run,\" she says. \"The less pieces exist on the secondary market, the more that a collector will spend to get a hold of it.\" ","date":1520132575000,"topics":[]}

The government blamed the sausage known as polony for the listeria poisoning that has killed 180 people. It advised people not to eat any processed meat. It ordered a recall of the product, prompting shops to clear their shelves. Namibia, Mozambique, Malawi, Botswana and Zambia followed suit, all ordering a recall or suspending imports. The Mozambican ministry of agriculture and food security \"asks that all owners of establishments that commercialise these products start to withdraw from the shelves due to the danger that this constitutes to health\", it said in a statement. \u0027No direct link\u0027\nIt took South Africa more than a year to trace the outbreak. There have been 948 cases of listeria poisoning in South Africa reported since January 2017, according to Reuters - which the UN calls the largest outbreak ever. It is believed to have originated in a factory in the northern city of Polokwane, which makes Enterprise Food products. The chief executive of Tiger Brands, which owns the Enterprise label, insisted on Monday that \"no direct link\" had been proved between its products and any of the 180 deaths. Even so, Lawrence McDougall said his firm was \"being extra cautious and vigilant\" and abiding by the government\u0027s recall order. A plant owned by a second company, RCL Foods, is also under suspicion. It has suspended meat production too. \u0027It\u0027s in my kids\u0027 lunch\u0027\nAfter health authorities ordered a recall of polony, supermarkets like Shoprite, Pick n Pay, Spar and Woolworths cleared it from their shelves, along with bacon, sausages and other processed meat products. Customers descended on the outlets to return their purchases and demand a refund. \"I already packed my kids\u0027 lunch with this product, so I\u0027m shocked,\" said Tshepo Makhura, a 37-year-old call centre agent. \"I lost trust with Enterprise. I\u0027ll be scared even if they say this problem is solved. I would rather go back to peanut butter and jam.\" Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi warned people to \"avoid all processed meat products that are sold as ready to eat\". He told pregnant women to avoid any processed meat \"like the plague\", reported Times Live. A shortage of the solution used for testing for the listeria bacteria meant the results of the tests at the Polokwane factory were delayed by two weeks, an official at the National Institute of Communicable Diseases told Times Live. The listeria bacteria is hard to test for, as it is not homogenously distributed in food. It can also \"hide away\" in cracks or niches in factories. Consumers who have kept polony products in their fridges were advised to disinfect them with diluted bleach. What is listeriosis?\nSource: NHS ","date":1520268500000,"topics":["South Africa"]}

{"hash":"550778c092598f42ae990d3873c89edf","title":"Lego block","author":"bbc","feed":"business","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43300087","content":"Lego\u0027s latest set of annual numbers showed its first drop-off in profits and revenues for 13 years this week. After the Danish toy-maker turned itself around more than a decade ago, last year it failed to click with customers. It said it had produced too many bricks, and had to sell off excess stock at a discount. How can Lego have too many bricks? Isn\u0027t it just that it didn\u0027t manage to sell the sets it had produced?\nIn a way, yes. Every year it forecasts how much Lego it thinks it will need to manage its production, and last year its forecast wasn\u0027t on the money. Though to be fair, for the previous 13 years it has consistently underestimated how much it would need to produce, and hasn\u0027t made enough stock, says Frederique Tutt, global toy industry analyst at the NPD Group. Euromonitor toy analyst Matthew Hudak says \"a big issue is that Lego has now is that it\u0027s grown so quickly with only one product that it inevitably had slow down and hit a wall.\" Lego says its consumer sales in 2017 were flat, but it \"started 2017 with a higher than optimal levels of inventories\". \"The amount of Lego parents bought in 2017 was consistent with the prior year. However, because we sold fewer sets to retailers as we cleaned up inventories, revenues declined,\" it says. Has Lego lost its imagination? Are the pieces getting too specific?\nIt\u0027s a bit harsh to say Lego has lost its imagination, says Ms Tutt. The toy industry like every other is cyclical, and after 13 years it\u0027s \"fair enough to say it can have a rest\", she says. As for the pieces being too specific, she says today\u0027s children \"like to be taken by the hand\" rather than being given a set of generic blocks, and that themed sets have been \"a driver of success\" for Lego. However, in 2017 there \"was a bit too much of Star Wars, not just in Lego, but everywhere\", she says. After three years of successive marketing the market was slightly saturated, she says. In addition, there\u0027s \"not a lot of evidence that a toy company can lean too much on licensing as licensed toys are growing quite a bit globally,\" says Mr Hudak. \"The high proliferation of smartphones allows children to watch their favourite shows all the time, which is growing demand for more licensed products,\" he says. Lego says it hasn\u0027t run out of imagination. \"Only one out of five top selling themes in 2017 was licenced. That was Star Wars. The other themes were those created by our own talented designers.\" Is Lego too expensive?\nLego is more expensive than its direct competitors, but Ms Tutt says its quality is higher. It doesn\u0027t tend to use promotions that much because it doesn\u0027t have to, she says. As for permanently reducing price to stimulate sales - \"I don\u0027t think Lego wants to go that way\", she says. Lego pays licensing for sets that are linked to blockbuster brands such as Star Wars. That cost is directly passed on to consumers, making those sets more expensive. Lego says: \"We believe Lego products are unique and deliver great value for money. In addition, our products meet the highest safety and quality standards and last for generations.\" Has Lego failed to keep up with 2017 trends?\n\"Households can have too many Lego products and not want more each year, and equally important is that children have fickle tastes, and simply lose interest in Lego,\" says Mr Hudak. One of the big trends in 2017 in toys was \"collectibles\" - that is, toys that can be built up into a set. Whereas the year before Lego was more fashionable, in 2017 the focus was on toys such as Lol Surprise! Dolls, says Ms Tutt. However, in terms of what it does, Lego remains the market leader, with about two thirds of the global market in \"construction toys\", says Euromonitor. There was also a general slowdown in the toy market in the UK as people\u0027s disposable income was squeezed by higher inflation and low wage growth, Ms Tutt adds. Lego says: \"We launched some great products in 2017. In addition to our top-selling themes such as Lego City, Lego Friends and Lego Duplo, we introduced new play experiences inspired by the latest digital trends.\" Who are Lego\u0027s main customers?\nBoys aged between 5 and 9. The company has been diversifying towards trying to attract more girls, but boys (or more specifically, their parents, relations, and people with disposable income buying for them) remain the core customers, Ms Tutt says. There are Lego sets aimed at adult collectors, such as a Beatles Yellow Submarine, but these are more niche, says Ms Tutt. Lego\u0027s largest markets are the US, Western Europe - specifically UK, Germany, and France - and China, says Mr Hudak. Could Lego start using reclaimed plastic to help recycling efforts?\nIn a word, no, at least not soon. The type of plastic Lego uses is acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) which is tough to recycle. Reclaimed plastic would not be of a high enough quality. Lego is trying to move towards using more sustainable materials - it recently announced that it is moving towards using \"plant-based polyethylene\" from sugar cane. This is still a hard-wearing plastic. As children become more environmentally aware, Lego is likely to continue to get greener, says Ms Tutt. Lego says: \"We have set ourselves an ambitious target to make our bricks from sustainable sources by 2030... We are also working on developing new materials. Use of recycled materials presents many challenges, and to ensure that the product safety and quality is not compromised we are currently working on finding the right solution for using recycled materials in our products.\" ","date":1520356794000,"topics":["Lego","Companies"]}

{"hash":"dddc15f0e75ae591542e99548d6042c4","title":"Power up","author":"bbc","feed":"business","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43285885","content":"Imagine being able to charge your electric car in minutes rather than hours, or your smartphone in seconds. That\u0027s the enticing prospect being touted by researchers who reckon they\u0027ve discovered a new material that could boost the performance of a carbon-based supercapacitor - sometimes called an ultracapacitor - a type of energy storage device that can be charged very quickly and offload its power very quickly, too. Dr Donald Highgate, director of research at Superdielectrics Ltd, says a material he originally developed for soft contact lenses is also surprisingly good at holding an electrostatic field. Very simply, supercapacitors don\u0027t produce electricity through chemical reactions as conventional batteries do, they create these electrostatic fields. Dr Highgate is working with Bristol and Surrey universities to develop supercapacitors using the new polymer and hopes that they could eventually rival, or even surpass, lithium-ion (li-ion) batteries - so long as they manage to replicate prototype performance on a large scale. So far, supercapacitors have been good at providing quick bursts of power - to start a car engine, for example, or to give trains a boost when accelerating. They\u0027re also well-suited to harvesting energy from vehicles when they brake, making them an important component in electric vehicles. And national electricity grids use them to provide quick power top-ups when balancing supply and demand. South Korea\u0027s capital Seoul is hoping to have 3,500 supercapacitor-powered buses operating by 2020, and they\u0027re also being used in Shanghai, China. European car maker PSA Peugeot Citroen has been using them in its cars since 2010 - supercapacitor maker Maxwell Technologies says more than a million vehicles now incorporate its products. But to date, supercapacitors haven\u0027t been very good at holding much power or holding on to that power for very long. This poor energy density, as it\u0027s called, the amount of power they can hold per kilogramme, has put them at a significant disadvantage to li-ion batteries. More Technology of Business\n\"The two main advantages of conventional supercapacitors over batteries are their ability to handle much higher charge and discharge rates, and their longer cycle life,\" says Gareth Hinds, Fellow of the UK\u0027s National Physical Laboratory. \"The downside is that they tend to be relatively high cost and can only store a few seconds-, or at most, minutes-worth of power.\" This isn\u0027t a problem when your supercapacitor is being used to power a tool on a factory assembly line, for example. It can be recharged in seconds once it\u0027s placed back in its charging dock. But it is if you\u0027re in an electric car or bus that needs recharging every few miles. Taavi Madiberk, chief executive and co-founder of Skeleton Technologies, a supercapacitor maker based in Estonia, Germany and Finland, says his products incorporate layers of graphene - a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice - and other carbon-based materials in its supercapacitors. These layers have a huge surface area - just 1g of graphene can cover 2,000 sq m, says Mr Madiberk. This allows them to hold on to a lot more power. His firm\u0027s products are already used in hybrid vehicles, particularly buses and lorries. In one experiment, they installed supercapacitors in a Sainsbury\u0027s supermarket diesel-electric delivery van and \"achieved 32% fuel savings\", says Mr Madiberk. But he acknowledges that in the short-term, combining supercapacitors with li-ion batteries is probably the best way to enjoy the best of both worlds, particularly in electric vehicles. Ulrik Grape, chief executive of NaWa technologies, another supercapacitor maker based in the South of France, agrees, saying: \"Supercapacitors don\u0027t store as much energy but their response is instantaneous. So a supercapacitor could handle acceleration and energy recovery under braking - taking care of the stressful part of a battery\u0027s life - possibly doubling or tripling a battery\u0027s life expectancy.\" NaWa\u0027s technology involves electrodes made from \"vertically aligned carbon and graphene nanotubes that can store the energy on the surface of these tubes,\" explains Mr Grape. These tubes, which are coated with another carbon-based material, are so tiny you can fit 10 billion of them in a square centimetre. As carbon is a light material, incorporating supercapacitors into li-ion batteries would also reduce the overall weight, and this would improve the range performance of an electric vehicle. A Formula E racing car\u0027s battery, currently made by Williams Advanced Engineering, weighs 300kg, but this could be reduced by a third to 200kg, NaWa believes, without any loss of range. \"We think the ability to charge and discharge a battery fast will be one of the most important things in the future,\" says Mr Grape. \"We don\u0027t have as much energy as a lithium-ion battery but we can do many more cycles - charges and discharges - up to a million. Carbon is such a robust material.\" By contrast, a normal battery, which relies on chemical reactions to create electricity, eventually wears out once those chemicals lose their potency - after about 3,000 to 5,000 cycles of charging and discharging. Another advantage of supercapacitors, makers say, is that they don\u0027t require rare materials, such as cobalt. Of course, supercapacitors don\u0027t mean the end of traditional batteries by any means. Li-ion technology is still being improved by about 5-10% each year. New forms of energy storage will be critical to the success of renewable energy as a replacement for fossil fuels. When the sun doesn\u0027t shine or the wind doesn\u0027t blow, we\u0027ll need to access stored energy very quickly to plug the gap. As well as traditional energy storage methods, such as pumped hydro, flywheels, compressed gas and large battery arrays, highly efficient supercapacitors could eventually become a crucial component in a fully sustainable energy network. But these are early days. \"Polymer-based supercapacitors are emerging as a promising technology,\" concludes Gareth Hinds, \"but there is a lot of work still to do to achieve the required energy storage capacity without compromising on power, lifetime and cost.\" ","date":1520295329000,"topics":["Renewable energy"]}

Then the Football Association banned them from its grounds. Here\u0027s the story of the fall and rise of women\u0027s football, told through 10 objects collected by the National Football Museum. \"Complaints having been made as to football being played by women, the [FA] council feel impelled to express their strong opinion that the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and ought not to be encouraged. Complaints have also been made as to the conditions under which some of these matches have been arranged and played, and the appropriation of receipts to other than charitable objects.\" With these words in 1921, the FA decided to ban the playing of women\u0027s football in FA-member grounds, which strangled the game as a successful business as the stricture remained in place for 50 years. In other countries there were outright bans on women playing. Jean Williams, the University of Wolverhampton\u0027s professor of sport, takes us through items which show the business history and struggles of the women\u0027s game. 1. 1895 Sketch magazine print of Nettie Honeyball \u0027in her football costume\u0027\n\"In 1863 we get the formation of the Football Association and of the modern game. The first women\u0027s football games that we know about are in 1881, and they are professional games played to large audiences and they make money. It seems they are organised by local businessmen. The 1881-82 games are relatively short lived. \"Nettie Honeyball is the secretary and captain of the first British Ladies Football Club, which was founded in 1894. She was a middle class woman, and they had a non-playing president Lady Florence Dixie, who was upper class. \"In historic terms this was the first time women organised football for women. The first game was in Crouch End in 1895 before 10,000 people, which must have generated healthy receipts. Hundreds of games follow in the next few years and the women\u0027s game is played all over Britain.\" 2. Wheaties cereal box from the 1990s featuring US player Michelle Akers\n\"In the 1991 women\u0027s world championship she was the winner of the golden boot. She was the first real international women\u0027s football star and was massive in the US. She paved the way for Mia Hamm and Hope Solo, but interestingly one of the things that constricted her potential success was that she suffered from chronic fatigue disorder. But for that, her international profile could have been much more. \"The narrative of the Wheaties box is that she has had challenges to overcome but is still achieving and can\u0027t be held back. This is all referred to on the packaging of the cereal, which the manufacturers call \u0027The Breakfast of Champions\u0027. \"It is one of the first commercial endorsements of this type in the 1990s, at a time when Fifa finally decided they were going to actively oversee women\u0027s football, having taken over its stewardship in 1971 but not doing much to promote it in the intervening years.\" 3. Programmes from 1950s women\u0027s football matches\n\"The crux of the FA\u0027s ban is that it does not ban women\u0027s football outright, but stops it being played on member clubs\u0027 grounds. Before the ban women\u0027s football is an entertainment spectacle, and if you play it in enclosed stadiums then you can charge people money to come in and watch. \"Once the ban comes in women\u0027s football goes to other venues: to rugby league and cricket grounds, as well as other venues. These programmes show games being played at Belle Vue speedway stadium, Manchester, and at a general sports stadium on the Isle of Man. \"But the FA puts pressure on other sports not to host women\u0027s games, which destroys the business model of the women\u0027s game. And that gives growth to the myth that women\u0027s football has never been an entertaining commercial spectacle. The game is still finding its way back from the ban.\" 4. Christie and Barbie football dolls\n\"These dolls were released for sale before the 1999 Women\u0027s World Cup by toymaker Mattel. The goalkeeper of that team was Briana Scurry.\" [The first woman goalkeeper and first black woman to be elected to the US National Soccer Hall of Fame.] \"But more generally, it reflects [the fact] that the American consumer market was sensitive and aware of questions of ethnicity and race. The marketing of the dolls was as diverse and inclusive as it could be. \"There was obviously already an established business around the Barbie and Christie brands, but such was the growing marketing power of women\u0027s football that a major manufacturer thought it could cash in further around the 1999 World Cup.\" 5. Shirt from Eniola Aluko\u0027s debut, England v Netherlands, 2004\n\"The business significance is that major manufacturer Umbro produced the shirt. Historically, sporting brands have not created consumer markets in women\u0027s football replica wear in the same way that they have done in other sports, particularly the high-fashion ones of tennis and golf. \"It is only relatively recently that that sporting brands have released football shirts cut for women, or boots specifically made for female feet. However, while these other aspects of women\u0027s football shirts have progressed, what is interesting is that often the shirt sponsors within the game are not of such \u0027high brand value\u0027 as the men\u0027s game. \"There is a real opportunity out there for brands such as cosmetics firms to sponsor women\u0027s football teams, but you get brands like Nivea preferring to partner with the Liverpool men\u0027s football team.\" 6. A ticket from the 1991 Women\u0027s World Championship with sponsor\n\"This ticket, being sponsored by M\u0026Ms, shows that a major US confectionery brand was using women\u0027s football to try and crack the potential new business market of China. The tournament was played for the M\u0026Ms Cup. Meanwhile, China wanted to establish a commercial relationship with the West. \"There were seven sponsors of this first official women\u0027s global tournament in 1991, which Fifa interestingly, and tentatively, called a \u0027world championship\u0027 and not a World Cup. Fifa wanted to get into China and China wanted to join the world football family, so to test the waters this low-financial-risk event was drawn up. \"The event was a sporting success and also a successful media product, it was sold to TV companies around the world, and it showed full stadia for the women\u0027s game.\" 7. Ball and boots of the type worn by 1920s/30s star Lily Parr\n\"Lily Parr was the star of the Dick, Kerr Ladies football team of Preston. She began playing for the team at 14, and played for them for 20 years. There are various reports of Lily receiving \u0027broken time payments\u0027, that is, financial compensation for amateur players for time they had had to take off from their day jobs. These women players were nurses, munitions workers, and so on. \"These payments, with her earnings from nursing, enabled her to become the first person in her family to own their own home. Obviously this all relates to the ban of 1921 as the FA decides too much of the charitable funds from women\u0027s matches are being used for player expenses. They were meant to be amateurs but the financial arrangements could be described as at best opaque. \"The boots and ball are from her era. She was a left winger, then moved back into defence and ended her career in goal.\" 8. Poster for an unofficial Women\u0027s World Cup in 1970\n\"There were two unofficial Women\u0027s World Cups held in the early 1970s: one in Italy in 1970 and one in Mexico a year later, both backed by local business interests and played in major football stadiums. \"In Mexico the event definitely looked to piggyback the men\u0027s World Cup held in the country the previous year. That would explain the commercialisation of the women\u0027s event there, which was considerable, with key rings, badges, programmes and other consumables produced, and a lot of coverage in the local press. The final was played in the Azteca Stadium in front of 110,000. \"The Italian event was sponsored by Italian multinational drinks brand Martini \u0026 Rossi, and its final was held in the Turin\u0027s Stadio Communale in front of 40,000.\" [Denmark defeated the host nations in both finals]. 9. Postcard of Dick, Kerr Ladies FC (1920s)\n\"Dick, Kerr wanted to be known as the best in the world, but also wanted to plug into the success of the local men\u0027s team and the civic notion of Proud Preston. They had a regular paying public who supported them financially at weekends but also at pioneering floodlit matches. \"Most of the crowds at their games are local working-class men. When we think we are being progressive by following women\u0027s football, it was these men who were coming out to support the team week in, week out. \"This commercially-produced postcard is evidence of \u0027ambient marketing\u0027, typical of how the team\u0027s fame spread beyond their home town to a much wider audience. Newsreel films and magazine articles will also have spread their name further afield.\" 10. Art deco statuette of a female footballer\n\"Because women\u0027s football has always been topical, representing modernity, assertive female physicality, and - in its early days - played solely to raise large sums of money, its broader representation has always been culturally significant. \"So artefacts, collectables, disposable items, ephemera, have been created around the game over the decades. This statuette is an example of a stylised female football player that someone would have had in their home. It is 1920s in appearance. \"There were a lot of similar models made around women\u0027s boxing and athletics; beautified art deco creations.\" Professor Williams has organised Upfront and Onside: The Women\u0027s Football Conference, about the history and heritage of women\u0027s football to be held at the National Football Museum in Manchester on International Women\u0027s Day, 8 March, and the following day.

In one long take, it shows a Nasa Space Shuttle in mid-orbit being destroyed by a hail of space debris, sending astronaut Ryan Stone played by Sandra Bullock hurtling into space. Director Alfonso Cuaron conceived the visceral scene, but it was London-based visual effects company Framestore that did the hard graft of turning it into reality. The firm won an Oscar for its work on the movie, which took almost four years and a team of 400 specialists to complete - from animators and physicists to computer scientists. \"No one had ever really successfully portrayed zero gravity in a film, so we had to reinvent the film-making process,\" says Framestore\u0027s boss and founder Sir William Sargent. \"Many of the techniques and technologies used to create the movie simply did not exist when we started.\" Founded in 1986, Framestore has worked on a host of other big movies, including the Harry Potter series, Batman The Dark Knight, Bladerunner 2049 and the Paddington films; its annual revenues now exceed £129m. But as the strategic brains behind the business, Sir William has had to navigate a rapidly changing industry that has left some visual effects companies struggling to stay afloat. Born in the Republic of Ireland, Sir William actually began his career in rock and roll back in the late 1970s, renting out musical equipment to Irish bands such as the Boomtown Rats, Thin Lizzy and U2 while studying business and law at Dublin\u0027s Trinity College. \"My dad was a chartered accountant but I didn\u0027t share in the vision,\" the 61-year-old says with a smile. \"He wouldn\u0027t support me, so I had find a way to pay the bills.\" Moving to London after graduating from university, Sir William had a dream of writing film scripts but soon realised he was better suited to the business side of things. \"I guess I\u0027m a failed writer,\" he says. \"But I also learnt the writer is the bottom of the food chain, and if you want to progress there\u0027s nothing like being the producer as well.\" Together with four friends he set up Framestore in 1986, with the aim of supplying a new technology that allowed producers to \"digitally paint\" on film. One of their first jobs was the music video for Norwegian pop group A-ha\u0027s hit debut single Take on Me, which featured the band in a pencil sketch animation mixed with live action. \"It was pretty revolutionary stuff 30 years ago,\" says Sir William. \"We were starting just as digital effects were coming in.\" Videos for David Bowie and Paul McCartney followed, as well as adverts for brands such as Weetabix. The firm has also worked in television, handling the computer-generated imagery for the BBC\u0027s award-winning natural history series Walking with Dinosaurs. But it wasn\u0027t until 1998 that Hollywood came knocking, and Framestore was hired to work on sci-fi comedy Lost in Space staring Gary Oldman and Matt Leblanc. Sir William says the movie, which was shot in London, heralded a renaissance in British film-making. \"America didn\u0027t see the UK as a centre of excellence of film-making in those days - but today it is,\" he says. \"Think about the number of Hollywood movies made in the UK; in any given month you\u0027ll have three of the six big [US] studios filming in London.\" Some have criticised the film industry for relying too heavily on digital effects, particularly in blockbuster action movies. But Sir William, who perhaps ironically has always preferred narrative-led movies to effects-laden ones, says \"ultimately it\u0027s just a tool\". \"Almost every film uses digital effects in some way - there is a lot of invisible work you just don\u0027t know about,\" he says. \"It also opens up a lot of story-telling possibilities that weren\u0027t there 30 years ago.\" Today Framestore employs 2,500 staff, around 1,000 at its London headquarters, and the rest across offices in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Montreal, Pune in India and Beijing. Its annual revenues have grown by 12-15% every year since it was founded, says Sir William. Matt Mueller, editor of film magazine Screen International, explains that tax breaks and cheaper technology have allowed firms from around the globe to enter the visual effects market in recent years. This has increased the competition for firms like Framestore, and driven a string of big effects houses in the US out of business. More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: How Simon Carter fashioned a global menswear brand The beauty boss who turned snakes into ladders The macs that make you melancholy How violent revolution gave birth to a global brand Mr Mueller says: \"The UK has been a growing industry, but it could face challenges as more enter the market. \"You might see a lot of migration of this work towards South East Asia.\" Sir William acknowledges there\u0027s a \"downward pressure\" in his industry but says it\u0027s \"always been tough\" and Framestore has kept on growing. What could be more of a headache for the firm is Brexit, which analysts say could spur a brain drain in a UK industry already facing skills shortages. Sir William admits he\u0027s concerned as Framestore\u0027s London headquarters employs staff from almost every EU country. But he points out it has diversified well, opening offices in up-and-coming visual effects hubs such as India and Canada, and will continue to do so. In 2016, Framestore sold a 75% stake in its business to the Chinese conglomerate Cultural Investment Holdings (CIH) for £150m - a clear sign of where it sees the future. \"China\u0027s creative industries are growing fast and I want to be a part of that,\" Sir William says. \"China\u0027s box office has gone up six-fold in the last nine years. They are consuming a huge amount of other digital content too.\" Despite the CIH deal, Sir William and his management team continue to run the business. In addition to leading Framestore, Sir William, who was knighted in 2008 for his services to business and the UK government, has also held a number of high-ranking civil service roles. Between 2005-2010 he was a permanent secretary in the Cabinet Office, advising on regulatory reform under Labour prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. He was also on the Treasury board until 2010, and is now part of the Mayor of London\u0027s business advisory board. On top of this, he still finds time to keep up with his beloved Tottenham Hotspur, and bring up his 18-month-old son (he has two adult children as well). \"I like doing two things at once, it keeps you fresh and you learn a lot,\" he says.

Alice did it last year trying to make ends meet. It\u0027s not the lifestyle you imagine for a highly educated associate lecturer. Insecure work isn\u0027t something you\u0027d normally associate with the world of academia. But that\u0027s all Alice, aged 31, has ever known. \"It\u0027s just exhausting. You\u0027ve got no security. And you\u0027ve always got to be scouting for work for the next term or academic year. \"Financially, it\u0027s impossible. In terms of the future, friends have houses, got mortgages, cars. I\u0027ve no savings, living in debt and there\u0027s the impact on my mental health. I\u0027ve suffered from anxiety and depression from my work situation.\" We haven\u0027t used her real name, because Alice fears she might lose what few hours of work she\u0027s got. She\u0027s currently on a contract with four hours of guaranteed teaching a week in term time at a university in the south of England. She gets paid £40 an hour, which includes her preparation and marking. \"I\u0027m usually doing many more hours on top of that, unpaid, to get all the work done. If you\u0027re teaching a new module, it works out less than the minimum wage because of all the extra hours demanded to do the role, from reading time to liaising with students. I would say it\u0027s poverty wages.\" Alice has just finished her PhD, teaching along the way. Last year she found herself shuttling between three different higher education institutions, doing five to six hours in each. She also worked in a bar and taught in schools to top up her pay. Alice says that, in her department, there are more people being paid by the hour than there are full-time staff - and they are also doing most of the teaching. \u0027Secure job\u0027\n\"It\u0027s ridiculous given the level of knowledge and experience I have. I think many full-time staff are embarrassed, as we\u0027re a bit like a ghost workforce who come in for a few hours, do the teaching and leave. I also work in a cinema at the moment which is a more secure job to me,\" she says. Five other academics, in different parts of the country, including one of the Russell Group universities, tell similar stories of insecure work. One of them, who\u0027s now managed to secure a permanent contract, spoke of how he was forced to take occasional naps in his car in between teaching and working part-time cleaning the streets. So how much teaching in our universities is being delivered by academics who are hourly paid or on insecure contracts? Jonathan White, the University and College Union\u0027s (UCU) bargaining policy and negotiating official, says: \"We\u0027ve argued for years that a lot of the teaching in universities is, in fact, done by people precariously employed, struggling to make ends meet and universities have been trying to sweep it under the carpet.\" He sent a freedom of information request to 135 higher education institutions last year, seeking figures on the amount of teaching delivered by hourly paid staff. More than half either wouldn\u0027t or couldn\u0027t disclose any data; others provided partial information, including Alice\u0027s university. Only 38 universities provided useable material on the 2015/16 academic year, with lots of caveats over its accuracy. In other words, it\u0027s not possible to draw any clear-cut conclusions. But it did throw up some interesting examples. For instance, the University of Derby reported just over a quarter of its teaching was done by hourly-paid staff. So did University College Birmingham. According to Mr White, there\u0027s enough information to show the problem\u0027s much bigger than universities want to admit. \"What we\u0027re trying to do is an approximation of scale,\" he says. \"What we found is broadly what we thought we\u0027d find. There are tens of thousands of people teaching hundreds of thousands of hours of education who are being paid by the hour.\" University employers say the report is flawed and misleading, along with all the other research the UCU has done. Their association, UCEA, believes casual staff do a very small amount of teaching. \"The quality of very many degree programmes at higher education institutions today is frequently enhanced by input from skilled professionals from outside the sector contributing specialist teaching on specific courses,\" it said in a statement. \"Such input is hugely valued by students and is often essential for the programme\u0027s accreditation. Hourly-paid teaching and tutoring also provide important developmental opportunities for postgraduates, particularly for those interested in a future career in the sector.\" The Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa) is responsible for publishing the official data. It says the data, as it\u0027s currently gathered, doesn\u0027t give a straight answer on the level of precarious employment in academia. \"We do know that around one third of academic staff, around 70,000 people, are on fixed-term contracts. We don\u0027t know much detail below that. For instance, how they feel or how many hours they do or anything like that level of data. It\u0027s just not obvious,\" says Hesa\u0027s chief executive, Paul Clark. Hesa, he says, is hoping to start publishing more detailed analysis on employment in a year or so\u0027s time. \u0027Much more freedom\u0027\nFor universities, short-term contracts have become more important then they used to be. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, an independent think tank, says: \"Universities look and feel just a little bit more like running a business than they used to. \"One thing that\u0027s changed, for example, is that students have much more freedom about which university they go to and universities are now free to recruit as many students as they like. \"It\u0027s a volatile situation. There are uncertainties about Brexit, how many international students there will be and part-time numbers have more than halved. \"The other thing is they want to expand popular courses and shut down less popular ones. And if you\u0027ve got staff on more flexible contracts these are easier things to do.\" Another reason, he says, is the focus on academic research which brings more prestige and big research contracts to universities. But it can mean less time for teaching so universities are left with holes in their timetables to fill. \"I worry that we have got an imbalance, that we have too many of the short-term, temporary contracts. If you\u0027re an ambitious academic, you want the security of a full-time position, it allows you to settle down,\" Mr Hillman says. \"Not everyone wants a full-time job, of course. But it\u0027s absolutely the right time to be talking about these things, having this debate. If we want happy students and successful universities we want happy staff.\" Alice loves teaching and is still pursuing her dream of an academic career, for now. \"I\u0027m stuck in this limbo position. It\u0027s ridiculous given the level of knowledge and experience I have. \"I\u0027m applying for full-time jobs now. If I don\u0027t have anything by September I will have to evaluate whether I continue. I just don\u0027t want to oppress myself anymore. \" ","date":1520154958000,"topics":["UK economy","Universities","Universities in the UK","Poverty"]}

{"hash":"dadcad9b067004a1042ad4e739bea501","title":"Hypersonic ambitions","author":"bbc","feed":"business","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43151175","content":"Chinese researchers have presented a new design concept for a hypersonic aircraft, which they say is a big step towards one day flying from Beijing to New York in just a few hours. Which would no doubt be a speedier and perhaps more convenient option than the current 14 hours. Research into hypersonic flight itself is nothing new, but it usually focuses on military applications where there is more money for research and less pressure to break even. So will flights five times the speed of sound ever make commercial sense, and carry passengers in two hours across the Pacific? Fast, faster, fastest\nWhen it comes to measuring aircraft going really fast the benchmark used is the speed of sound or Mach 1, around 1,235km/h (767mph). Hypersonic is what the Chinese research is focusing on, with a team at the Chinese Academy of Sciences looking at one of the two big challenges; the aerodynamics, and the engine, which is much harder to solve. In terms of design, hypersonic flight requires something that can minimise drag, that is the resistance to motion from the air; the faster the aircraft, the more drag becomes an issue. \"It goes approximately as velocity squared: if you double velocity, you quadruple the drag,\" explains professor Nicholas Hutchins of the University of Melbourne. What\u0027s new about the design proposed and tested in China is a second layer of wings attached above the usual wings, in order to reduce drag; it\u0027s a little similar to a biplane. At the moment the developers have only tested a scaled down model in a wind tunnel. So the project is still far from, quite literally, taking off. Getting to Mach 5\nEven if a design manages to cut down on drag, there are still other challenges that remain. Heat resistance is one, for instance. But then there\u0027s also the not inconsiderable issue of the sonic boom. If a plane breaks the speed of sound, it generates shockwaves. In simple terms that\u0027s a really loud bang. So loud it can shatter glass. The engine is the more tricky bit when it comes to getting a future hypersonic aircraft airborne. Once a vehicle has reached Mach 5, it can be propelled by a so-called scramjet engine: an air-breathing jet engine that sucks in air and uses that to burn its fuel. But, and it\u0027s a big but, this type of engine only works from Mach 5 onwards, so it requires another jet engine to get the aircraft going this fast in the first place. That could be an extremely powerful, traditional jet engine but eventually some combination of the two would be needed, say experts. \"There\u0027s been a major programme going on in China over the last couple of years to basically design that engine,\" explains professor Michael Smart, chair of hypersonic propulsion at the University of Queensland. \"That\u0027s what would be the real breakthrough.\" Commercially viable?\nAside from technical advances and possible landmark moments, the question is of course whether there\u0027s ever going to be a commercial market for hypersonic flights. Steal a quick glance at Concorde and you might have your doubts. The supersonic Anglo-French jet was hailed as the future of air travel when it first flew in 1969, but few were ever built, and it was eventually axed in 2003 with no sign of a successor. For one thing, the flights were too expensive for most travellers. And remember the sonic boom? Well that meant Concorde was only allowed to fly faster than sound once over the ocean. This restricted routes to trips across the Atlantic, and hence hurt its commercial viability. So although recent years have seen renewed interest in supersonic airliners, it\u0027s all still at development stage. Challenges would be even bigger with hypersonic flights. They\u0027d be even more expensive and also cause a sonic boom. The research paper published in the February edition of Physics, Mechanics \u0026 Astronomy boldly assumes that in the future, hypersonic flights will be \"more convenient and efficient\" than getting on board a conventional plane. But it is \"at least 15 to 20 years\" before any such plans could be commercially viable, says Ellis Taylor of Flight Global. \"It\u0027s hard to see a market for this at the moment,\" he says. \"Historically in fact, air fares have been going down rather than up and it would be hard to get a wider clientele for a hypersonic flight. \"It would be a very, very niche thing - and that of course significantly upsets the economics of a commercial service.\" Military competition\nAccording to Chinese media reports, the scientists behind the research are also involved in Beijing\u0027s military projects around hypersonic speed, and it is defence that lies at the heart of hypersonic ambition. Think of aerial surveillance for instance that could be deployed very quickly, and would be hard to intercept. Or perhaps hypersonic missiles that could render existing defence systems useless. The big players on that stage are the US, China and to some extent also Russia. Unsurprisingly, military research is a lot more secretive and it\u0027s hard to say who has the edge. \"Historically, the US has always been in the lead, but China is catching up very quickly,\" says Prof Smart. So the plans for a commercial hypersonic jet, even if they are at the early stages, are a bold marker leaving little doubt over China\u0027s ambition.

{"hash":"59032f8d2af2980437052679effe3aeb","title":"Gum shoes","author":"bbc","feed":"business","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-43198104","content":"British designer Anna Bullus is on a mission to recycle chewing gum into useful objects, cleaning up our streets in the process. More than £14bn is spent on chewing gum around the world each year, but a lot of that gum will end up stuck to the ground. Gum is the second most common type of street litter after cigarette materials. In the UK, councils spend around £50m each year cleaning up the mess. But Anna had an idea. What if the sticky stuff could actually be recycled and turned into useful objects? Around 10 years ago, she began a project looking at kerbside litter. She examined random samples, looking at things like crisp packets and cigarette butts. She then tried to figure out which elements could be recycled. \"One of the litters I found was a piece of chewing gum and as a designer I was completely amazed there was nothing actually being done to recycle it,\" she said. Researching the chemistry of chewing gum, she discovered that its main ingredient, the gum base, is commonly a synthetic rubber, a type of polymer similar to plastic. Hear more\n\"It\u0027s called polyisobutylene,\" explains Anna, \"the same stuff you find in the inner tube of bicycle wheels.\" It is obtained from petrochemicals, which are refined from fossil fuels like crude oil. She realised that chewing gum, even once it has been finished with, is a versatile and potentially useful material. Collecting gum\nBut how do you persuade people to donate their gum - instead of carelessly tossing it on to the street? As part of her strategy, Anna created bright pink, bubble-shaped bins specially for disposing of gum called Gumdrop, which can be hung at head-height. These bins are themselves made of recycled chewing gum. A message next to the bins explains that any gum collected will be recycled into new objects. But would gum-chewers use them? The University of Winchester was one of the first places to sign up to use the bins. Around 8,000 people live and work on its campus and the authorities wanted to keep it clean of gum litter. It adopted a twin-pronged strategy to tackle the problem. It installed 11 of Anna\u0027s special bins and to reinforce the message that gum can be recycled if disposed of responsibly, it gave out hundreds of coffee cups made of recycled gum to first-year students. \"Students would give the cup a sniff to check it didn\u0027t smell of mint or bubble gum,\" recalls Liz Harris, the university\u0027s environmental officer. \"It\u0027s because so much of the chewing gum sold on the high street is a polymer [so it] can be used to make new products. \u0027When people get it, it\u0027s a really nice moment.\" Eighteen months later, the university noticed a drop in gum litter and is expanding the scheme. Heathrow Airport also ran a three-month trial which it said led to a \"noticeable improvement\" and saved it £6,000 in cleaning costs. Great Western Railway has installed the bins in more than 25 of its railway stations and is rolling out the scheme further. In each case, the bins did not suddenly solve the problem of gum litter, but they did seem to begin to change people\u0027s behaviour. Moulding gum\nAnother challenge for Anna was to find industrial partners willing to recycle old gum - something completely novel. She eventually persuaded a recycling plant in Worcester to get on board. It takes her bins and filters out unwanted material, like paper or sweet wrappers, before grinding it into pieces and then compounds this with other recycled plastic polymers. The proportion in the mixture varies, but Anna says each object she makes contains a minimum of 20% chewing gum. At a plastic moulding specialist in Leicester called Amber Valley, which normally makes alarm casings, Anna creates her designer objects. Here, the mixture containing the old chewing gum is put into an injection moulding machine. It is heated and then ejected as a paste, which can be moulded into new objects as it cools. \"There\u0027s no difference [from] the equivalent polypropylene material that it\u0027s based against, the processing temperatures and parameters are all identical,\" says Brett Nixon, a manager at the plant. \"When you are handling the finished product, you do take a while to adjust to the fact that this has been in somebody\u0027s mouth previously. \u0027But once you get over that fear it\u0027s easy. By recycling it and giving it another lease of life it\u0027s helping the environment, it\u0027s an absolutely fantastic idea.\" Industry response\nThe UK Parliament has considered imposing taxes on chewing gum companies if they do not do more to combat gum litter. Anna\u0027s project has been given financial support from Wrigley, one of the largest manufacturers. It also provides her with surplus material from its Plymouth factory to add to her supply. Alex Hunter-Dunn, a spokesman for Wrigley, explained why the company backs the project. \"Gumdrop is a really creative and innovative way to get people responsibly disposing of their gum and binning it. We fundamentally believe that behaviour change is the only long-term sustainable solution to tackle the issue and we are very much behind that.\" Other approaches are being tried to beat the scourge of gum litter. Researchers have worked on a synthetic chewing gum that is biodegradable and will wash off the streets more easily, which is also the case with an organic chewing gum, made from Chicle gum native to Central America, which has a small market. But in the current market, dominated by synthetic, non-biodegradable gum, Anna thinks her method is the best option on the table. \"I do believe that through right design, \" she says, \"we can actually change the way people behave.\" Follow Dougal Shaw on Twitter @dougalshawbbc You can learn more about recycling chewing gum in the latest People Fixing the World podcastfrom the BBC World Service ","date":1520296781000,"topics":["University of Winchester","Recycling","World Hacks"]}

Analysts are warning of a trade war, as officials from Europe, Asia and Latin America threaten retaliation. Mr Trump predicted it would be \"easy\" for the US to win. But most economists and trade experts reject that view, saying every country, including the US, stands to lose in the event of a serious trade fight. \"If what we\u0027re talking about is who gets hurt the least, that would probably be the United States, but all countries get hurt in a trade war,\" says Edward Alden, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Here\u0027s why \"winning\" might not be so easy for the US. 1. Tariffs may not actually boost steel and aluminium jobs much\nMr Trump promoted his decision as a win for the steel and aluminium industries and said he expects investment and hiring to follow. But technological changes have made the industry less labour intensive. Historians say previous efforts to protect steel jobs have been largely ineffective. The companies present at Mr Trump\u0027s announcement did not respond to BBC inquiries about potential expansions. A 2002 analysis by the Peterson Institute for International Economics of proposed tariffs predicted the measures would \"save\" just 3,500 jobs. 2. Tariffs are likely to raise costs in the US\nToday, the steel industry estimates that it employs about 140,000 people - far fewer than in the sectors that rely on it. Criticism of the tariffs from those firms was immediate. For example, the National Retail Federation blasted it as a \"tax on American families\". US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said companies were over-reacting, but Mr Alden says the economic costs will be serious. The Charlotte Observer reports that Electrolux, manufacturer of washing machines and cookers, has already put on hold an expansion planned for Tennessee. 3. Tariffs could hurt allies and prompt retaliation\nIndividual industries and countries - especially places that are already negotiating wider trade deals such as Canada - will be lobbying furiously in the coming days for exemptions from the final tariffs. Absent that, analysts say they expect retaliation - and a broader weakening of the global free trade system. Countries could complain to the World Trade Organisation, but such cases take years and Mr Trump has been dismissive of that body. Moreover, WTO judges may be hesitant to second-guess the rarely used \"national security\" rationale the US has used to justify the tariffs, says Columbia Law professor Petros Mavroidis. Those factors make unilateral retaliatory tariffs more likely, he says. Such actions, which are expected to target industries in politically sensitive US states, could be in place within a year, he says. 4. China has options\nThe US blames China for flooding the market with cheap steel and aluminium and has already stepped up protective measures against Chinese steel products. Mr Trump says wider tariffs are necessary to stop Chinese steel appearing in the US via other countries. But US businesses, including those in the car, tech and agriculture industries, are eager to get into the Chinese market, giving leaders there some leverage. 5. The domestic political consequences are unclear\nMr Trump isn\u0027t unique among US presidents in using trade policy to protect politically strategic industries. But how beneficial such actions are is difficult to decipher, given the time lag between the decisions and elections, says Kenneth Lowande, a research fellow at Princeton University\u0027s Center for the Study of Democratic Politics. At the moment, Democrats are the most vocal defenders of the president. The move reportedly divided White House advisers, while congressional Republicans, who generally support free trade, have been sharply critical.

But are they effective or could they merely reinforce the image of women as victims? It was five o\u0027clock in the morning. Alexandra Ceranek was cycling through \"a lonely industrial area\" on her way to work as usual. \"I\u0027m a saleswoman and I have to start my work very early in the morning,\" says the 48-year-old from Oberhausen, Germany. \"Two men were standing there,\" she recalls. As she cycled past, one of them attacked her, grabbing her backpack and pulling her down off the bike and onto the ground. As she lay there in terror expecting a sexual assault, she kept saying to herself: \"Pull the cord, Alex! You have to pull the cord!\" She was wearing a pair of undershorts that incorporated an alarm activated by pulling on cut resistant cords made from the same material as bullet proof vests. \"My heart was beating wildly, but I managed to pull the cord and set off the alarm,\" she says. \"It made such a loud noise the two men ran away.\" These Safe Shorts incorporate a lock and alarm that also activates when someone tries to remove the garment by force. Safe Shorts founder Sandra Seilz says her own experience prompted her to develop the product. Returning from a run she was accosted by three men, she says, one of whom tried to pull off her leggings while the other held her down. \"You can imagine what the intention of the third man was,\" says Ms Seilz. \"But I was lucky. A man set his dog on them and the three men ran away.\" Assaults such as these are all too common for many women around the world, prompting many companies to come up with personal gadgets aimed at warding off attacks and alerting others. \"Vendors usually come from a crowdfunding background typically with very similar product functionality,\" says Rishi Kaul, a research analyst for consultancy Ovum. \"You click a button on the device and your GPS location is sent to preselected contacts, sometimes with an accompanying siren.\" For example, Safer, developed by Indian start-up Leaf Wearables, sells a pendant that doubles as a panic button. It is controlled by an accompanying smartphone app. Tanya Gaffney, 24, found it useful when walking to meet a friend in New Delhi, India, one evening. \"I felt someone walking behind me and it just felt suspicious. Every lane I turned into he took the same turn which made me panic,\" recalls Ms Gaffney. \"I was hoping to find a female figure or cop.\" But nobody was around. She sent an alert to her chosen group of \"guardians\" - her parents and two close friends - by pressing the back of her smart pendant twice. \"Luckily, the first person to call me was my friend who I was on my way to meet at the market. He told me he was tracking me via GPS and that he was on his way to get me,\" she says. The man following her eventually took a different turn, but \"the feeling of panic still terrorises me to this day,\" she says. Similarly, Nimb is a smart ring incorporating a panic button that sends an alert and your location to chosen recipients. The alert can also be forwarded to the emergency services. Nimb co-founder Kathy Roma was also a victim of crime 17 years ago. A man tried to strike up a conversation with her and stabbed her in the stomach when she didn\u0027t reply. Seriously wounded, she looked for help in a nearby building. She believes having a personal alert device would have brought help sooner. Other devices include Revolar, which enables users to \"check in\" and let loved ones or friends know you\u0027ve arrived home safely with a single click. Three clicks sends a \"help\" alert. And at the more sophisticated end of the market, Occly has developed Blinc, a wearable security device that includes a \"bodycam\" to record video evidence of an attack, as well as setting off a siren, flashing lights and a call for help. According to the World Health Organisation, about one in three women have experienced some form of assault, whether physical, sexual or both. And nearly two-fifths of murders of women are perpetrated by their partners. These safety gadgets have obviously helped some women avert disaster, but not everyone is convinced of their merits. \"We welcome anything that can be used to improve safety and help prevent sexual violence,\" says Fay Maxted OBE, chief executive of The Survivors Trust, an umbrella agency for 130 rape and sexual abuse support services across the UK. \"But such technology can also be misused - it can be hacked or used by perpetrators to track or stalk someone,\" she warns. More Technology of Business\nAnd Ms Maxted also worries that products such as Safe Shorts could \"play on the fears a woman might have about being out on her own, rather than making her feel safe. They reinforce the image that a woman is unable to protect herself. \"Why should women have to wear clothes that are locked?\" she asks. But as far as Alexandra Ceranek is concerned, her Safe Shorts prevented an assault from developing into something much worse. \"I want a protection when there is a critical situation and someone wants to attack me,\" she reflects. Ovum\u0027s Rishi Kaul thinks women\u0027s safety wearables will remain a niche market, particularly since there are now plenty of smartphone apps offering similar functionality, some that can be triggered by a scream or simply by shaking the phone. \"Women\u0027s safety wearables account for just 3.5% of the total wearables market,\" says Mr Kaul. \"This function can simply be replaced by a safety app on the phone, which is why there hasn\u0027t been much success in this niche.\" But for Ms Maxted, the issue of women\u0027s safety is more about education than technology. \"What technology solutions are there to teach potential abusers about consent and respect for women?\" she asks.

{"hash":"a431cd3d77677f1f65cd7edf3d079e4d","title":"Troubled times","author":"bbc","feed":"business","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43240996","content":"Britain\u0027s High Streets are in crisis. This week toy store chain Toys r Us collapsed into administration, along with the electronics retailer Maplin. The restaurant chains Jamie\u0027s Italian and Prezzo have announced closures, while fashion chain New Look and department store group House of Fraser are seeking to shore up their finances. Experts say retailers are battling a \"perfect storm\" of pressures and they expect more closures in 2018. 1. Squeezed incomes\nA big factor has been a fall in discretionary spending, spurred by rising shop prices and weak wage growth. A near 15% fall in the pound since the Brexit vote has pushed inflation over 3% - way above the Bank of England\u0027s 2% target. This has made imported goods more expensive, with those costs passed on to consumers. Couple that with the fact that wages have been rising at a slower pace than inflation - and shoppers have less disposable income to spend in stores and restaurants. By volume, retail sales have continued to grow but at a much slower rate - falling from from 4.7% in 2016 to 1.9% last year. \"It has been a real issue for high street retailers and accelerated the decline of some,\" says Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \"The sector was already suffering from structural problems, such as the rise in online shopping and high business rates. But the burst in inflation since the EU referendum has squeezed incomes in real terms, leading to much weaker growth in sales than retailers had anticipated.\" 2. The shift to online shopping\nOnline giants such as Amazon have had a huge impact on the high street as more consumers see online shopping as cheaper and easier than going to the shops. And while overall retail sales growth is weak, online sales continue to shoot up. Paul Martin, head of UK retail at KPMG, says: \"With the overall market not growing, it is all about market share, and 20% of that market is held by online players. If you don\u0027t have the right online offering, again, you will struggle.\" That is pushing retailers to try to reinvent their stores, with the likes of John Lewis and Debenhams now holding more in-store events and \"experiences\" to lure shoppers in. If shops fail to do either \"value, convenience, or experience\" well, they will struggle, Mr Martin says. 3. Changing tastes\nToys R Us fell short in all three areas, according to Simon Thomas of Moorfields Advisory, the toy chain\u0027s administrators. He says it was \"unlikely\" the retailer can be saved because its business model \"isn\u0027t what consumers really want now\". \"We\u0027ve got very large stores which are fairly impersonal. People are looking now to have a better shopping experience, and we were unable to deliver that.\" Mr Thomas adds: \"On top of all that we have the online problem … people can go into our shop, look at something, then look at an alternative and buy it at a cheaper price.\" 4. Rising overheads\nInflation is not the only cost pressure retailers face. The National Minimum Wage and new National Living Wage for over-25s go up each year, pushing up payroll costs. Trade body the British Retail Consortium estimates that the National Living Wage costs the industry between £1.5bn and £3bn a year. Business rates - which are due to rise again in April - are a burden too, it says. Retailers will pay an additional £2bn over the next three years compared to the last three years, a spokesperson says. \"Business rates are deterring investment in local communities, causing shop closures and job losses in hard-pressed communities and preventing retailers from delivering what their customers want in an efficient and cost-effective way.\" 5. Too many shops\nWith trading conditions tight, retailers cannot afford to have underperforming outlets. And yet many companies over-expanded during the good years, leaving them dangerously exposed. According to reports this week, New Look is set to close as many as 60 of its 600 UK stores as it continues to battle massive debts. Burger chain Byron said last month it would close as many as 20 outlets as part of a rescue plan approved by its lenders and landlords. At the time, boss Simon Cope said the firm wanted to focus on a smaller number of profitable restaurants. Richard Perks, director of retail research at Mintel, says: \"In business you either go forward or backwards - but how do you go forwards? The natural thing is to open stores. People convince themselves they need to and then it goes pear-shaped. \"But there\u0027s a lot more to being a successful retailer than your store count - having too many stores wouldn\u0027t kill you if you got everything else right.\" 6. Too much debt\nAs a consequence of overexpansion, many retailers are shouldering \"high debt burdens\", says KPMG\u0027s Mr Martin. Just before its collapse, Toys R Us UK faced a looming VAT debt payment deadline of £15m. It would have been unable to pay it without a cash injection from an outside investor. Mr Martin says 2018 will continue to be difficult for retailers, but it\u0027s not all doom and gloom. \"There will be winners and there will be losers. But if you\u0027re not good at online, if you\u0027re not really rigid about your cost structure, there will be more challenges to face going forward and no doubt we will see further casualties.\" ","date":1519913643000,"topics":["Toys R Us UK administration","Toys R Us UK administration","Retailing"]}

For the player - who was dubbed \u0027Red Nev\u0027 in his playing days for his perceived role as a dressing room shop steward - also has a burgeoning and wide-reaching business empire that includes restaurants and hotels, property development, and a proposed university, among others. The 43-year-old says he first started thinking about a life after football back in his early 20s, after a bad injury disrupted the career of his Manchester United friend and colleague Ben Thornley, who was released from Old Trafford after just nine league games. \"I realised then I had to be dual skilled,\" says Neville, who in contrast to his former team-mate went on to win eight Premier League titles, and Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup winners\u0027 medals. \u0027Motivated teams\u0027\nAfter first dipping his toe in the business world at the age of 23, when he invested in a friend\u0027s design company, he now holds directorships in more than 30 companies that employ more than 500 people in total. \"After my [Manchester United] training with the team in the morning I would go into the office in the afternoon and work with a different team,\" he recalls of that initial foray from the dressing room into the boardroom. Council pitches plan backed by Neville is opposed Neville and Giggs\u0027 £200m Manchester plan opposed again Ex-Manchester United stars\u0027 university plan revised The former Old Trafford captain says that he soon discovered similarities between the world of sport and business. \"In both you have to have motivated people, and they have to enjoy what they do,\" he says. \"Also, in football and business you have to work the hardest you can every single day, and make sure you never give in.\" However, he says that in business - unlike in football - it can sometimes be difficult to achieve the \"peer group analysis\" he encountered in the high-pressure Old Trafford dressing room, where players would instantly acknowledge responsibility for mistakes. \"It can be difficult in an office for people to admit they didn\u0027t do very well, or have fallen below standards,\" observes Neville, who was in London for an SME business event organised by Intuit QuickBooks. \u0027Needed stimulation\u0027\nWhile his friend\u0027s design firm is still going strong, in his mid-20s Neville moved into the world of property development, being careful to keep this other life a secret from fearsome Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson. \"He would have seen it as a distraction,\" Neville says, recalling sneaking into the showers to make and take business calls away from the Scot\u0027s prying eyes. \"Physically I accepted I had to have a rest [after training], but mentally I needed to be stimulated.\" Major Gary Neville business interests:\n\u0027Falling off a cliff\u0027\nThe former England international says from the age of 32, until his retirement at 36, he started to really focus on three areas that might provide a post-playing career - seeking out media training, obtaining coaching badges, and expanding his business interests. \"It can be like falling off a cliff ending your football career, going from playing in front of 75,000 people and then not being able to do that any more,\" he says. \"I thought logically - \u0027how am I going to fill this large void that is going to come?\u0027.\" He says his parents had a strong work ethic, as did his Old Trafford coaches, which meant he was able to hit the ground running when he moved into his new careers. The former England international says that 90% of his current business interests are making a profit, some are breaking even, and a few - like Salford City Football Club - are losing money. \"That is the reality though for a football club as it tries to make its way through the leagues,\" he says. Focused approach\nThere are a couple of flies in the ointment with regard to two of his other business ventures. There is some local opposition to his plans to develop an area of flooded land in Stretford, Greater Manchester, into new training pitches to be used by Salford City and his proposed university academy. Neville is also promising to upgrade and extend an existing group of community buildings nearby, but there are some objections, including from residents of nearby retirement accommodation. \"They are nervous about noise and light pollution. I am going to sit down and have some cake with them, and discuss things in two weeks\u0027 time,\" he says, adding that he believes the project will a major boost for football infrastructure in the area. Meanwhile, his proposed St Michael\u0027s property development in central Manchester, near to the city hall, has failed for a second time to win support from heritage body Historic England, despite being scaled down last year from the original plans. The city council\u0027s planning department is currently considering the latest application for the site, but the scheme has received a boost after the plans have been backed by council officers. Neville has also pledged to \"stop spreading myself so thinly across so many businesses this year\", and part of his focused approach for 2018 also includes a pledge not to return to football management or coaching. Brexit optimist\nMeanwhile, looking at the wider economy and state of the nation, the opinionated pundit from Sky TV is as forthright as he is about the performance of Premier League teams. With regards to Brexit, which has struck apparent fear into so many business sectors and organisations, he is bullish. \"I am not even planning for it; we have no idea about what is going to happen, if you are not careful you can sit there worrying that the world is going to end,\" he says. \"As employers we have to be agile, and move with changing conditions. You can\u0027t just park your bike and say we are not going on. \"It is not the biggest event in the world, we have been through a lot as a country over the past 150 years, and we will still be here in 150 years time when there will still be businesses employing people.\" ","date":1519865174000,"topics":["Companies"]}

Yet songwriters and musicians have long complained that they\u0027re not getting their fair share of the spoils, but now a number of tech start-ups are trying to help them receive what they\u0027re owed and give them more control. Dan Haggis, drummer with Liverpool band The Wombats, is a happy man. The band\u0027s fourth album, Beautiful People Will Ruin Your Life, recently entered the UK chart at number three - a career best. And this time around, they stand to make more money from their success. This is because they\u0027ve signed to Kobalt, a technology-driven music services company that gives songwriters and bands complete ownership of their work and a greater share of income than has traditionally been the case in the industry. \"We never used to make any money because we were always paying off our advances,\" recalls Haggis, whose band formed in 2003. \"We\u0027d get about a 20% share of revenues and the label would keep the rest. \"Now we get to keep about 90% of what we earn ...it\u0027s such a difference, it just made sense.\" Other tech start-ups such as Mycelia and Choon are also trying to use new technology, such as blockchain, to give more financial power back to music creators and help them track down what they\u0027re owed. Mycelia, a \"think and do tank\" of music professionals set up by London-based artist Imogen Heap, argues that having a verified global registry of artists and their works would help make the payment process more transparent. And Choon, a new streaming service and payments platform, is based on the Ethereum blockchain and promises to get more cash to artists by paying 80% of the revenues generated by their streams to them directly. It was the byzantine nature of the music industry\u0027s payments system that inspired Kobalt\u0027s Swedish founder, Willard Ahdritz, to set up his music publishing and technology platform, with the aim of collecting and tracking artists\u0027 song royalties much more quickly and accurately. Clients can see on an app how much revenue their works are generating globally in real time. \"Transparency is probably the key word,\" says Haggis. One of the problems to date has been the lack of metadata accompanying song information, argues music writer Stuart Dredge. If a recording lacks the necessary credits for the writers, performers and producers, they may not get their cut. \"Streaming isn\u0027t the villain,\" he says, \"but it\u0027s shining a light on some of the music industry\u0027s historic problems around data and attribution and making sure the right people get paid.\" But music analyst Mark Mulligan is highly sceptical of blockchain\u0027s potential to become a force in the music business. \"No label or rights association is going to allow blockchain to gain any momentum because they rely on a lack of transparency - there\u0027s a huge amount of revenue that\u0027s never attributed properly because of messy data and that just goes straight to the bottom line of record labels and publishers,\" he says. While so-called collection agencies will try to track down royalty payments for artists and protect their copyright, they acknowledge that this isn\u0027t always easy given the complex nature of a global industry that now has so many distribution platforms. PRS for Music, one of the UK\u0027s biggest music licensing societies, is involved in a multinational project with Berlin-based ICE Operations, which is attempting to automate copyright processing using cloud computing and machine learning. \"There\u0027s an awful lot more to creating a successful song than most people realise,\" explains PRS chief executive Robert Ashcroft, \"it doesn\u0027t just happen. From the idea to the crafting, from the engineering to the sound production and promotion - it\u0027s the result of a lot of professional effort.\" Better technology enabling royalty tracking and payments means that artists and writers are starting to get paid for the first time in markets such as China, where piracy has previously dominated. Streaming is now raking in more than $5bn (£3.6bn) globally for the three major music groups - Universal, Sony Music and Warner, considerably more than the $3bn from sales of CDs and vinyl records. Services such as as Spotify, Deezer, Tidal, Apple Music, YouTube and Amazon Music have become the de facto way many of us now source our favourite tunes. More Technology of Business\nSpotify dominates, accounting for around two-thirds of all song streams. But it pays many music labels less than a cent per stream. How much of that the songwriter or band gets depends on the deal it has with the label, but the ratio of label income to artist income is roughly 4:1. But last month, the US Copyright Royalty Board ruled that streaming services - Google, Amazon, Apple, Spotify and Pandora - would have to increase the share of their income they pay songwriters and publishers from 10.5% to 15.1%. Good news for songwriters. Meanwhile Kobalt continues to grow in popularity. The firm now manages about one million songs and accounts for roughly 40% of the songs on the UK and US top 100 charts. Its roster of artists includes Max Martin, who co-wrote hits such as Shake It Off for Taylor Swift and Roar for Katy Perry, as well as household names such as Lorde, Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters, Sir Paul McCartney, Pet Shop Boys and Enrique Iglesias. And it is now moving into music recording as well. The Wombats\u0027 Dan Haggis hopes that better technology will help secure the band\u0027s future. \"With any luck we will start having some money from each of the streaming services each month to keep the band going so that we don\u0027t have to rely on playing live and selling merchandise,\" he says. \"It\u0027s kind of an exciting time really, putting that power back in bands\u0027 hands, giving you control of your career and where you\u0027re going with it.\" ","date":1519689739000,"topics":["Spotify","Apple","Companies","Music"]}

There will also be eight graduates from a film college in Kenya nervously awaiting the results. These graduates of the Africa Digital Media Institute (ADMI) in Nairobi were part of the team making a movie nominated in the category of best short live action film. The film, called Watu Wote (or All of Us), tells the story of a terror attack on a bus in Kenya by militant group Al-Shabaab in 2015, in which Muslim passengers protected Christians. Nairobi slum\n\"I was at work when I got a call telling me we had been nominated,\" says 22-year-old ADMI graduate Claire Njoki, who helped to design and build the film\u0027s set. \"My mum was the first person I told and we cried together. I felt so good that we were able to tell that story about Kenya, it is every filmmaker\u0027s dream to reach the Oscars.\" The short history of ADMI could itself be a script for a feelgood film. The film school\u0027s founder, Wilfred Kiumi, grew up in a slum in Nairobi and developed a love of film after his uncle took him to a government-funded cinema. He worked in a barbershop to make enough money to go to college. But his ambition was to set up a film school which would give Kenyan students the full range of skills needed to succeed in the industry. \"At first people thought I was joking when I said I was trying to set up a school, but the more I talked to people about it the more they encouraged me and connected me to others who could help,\" he says. Six years ago this month, the college welcomed its first intake of only five students. Today, it has 350 students at a purpose-built campus in Narobi\u0027s Central Business District, complete with well-stocked graphic design and animation labs, sound studios and post-production labs. They study a two-year diploma which includes training in film and TV production, graphic design, journalism, sound engineering and animation, and an internship. Self-reliant\nThis is a broader curriculum than other film colleges and it is because Wilfred wanted to teach students to \"produce, shoot and deliver all by themselves without having to rely on others\". The ADMI\u0027s leaders say the nomination for Watu Wote, which involves ADMI graduates and is directed by Katja Benrath of Germany\u0027s Hamburg Media School, is a good start. But they have even bigger aims - they want to reclaim Kenyan and African stories so that they are told in film by African directors. \"Almost 90% of the content we consume is from the rest of the world - from Mexican soaps to Malaysian stories to big box office American movies,\" says Laila Macharia, director of the institute. \"So we aren\u0027t even used to seeing our own stories on screen. This is where we can have a great impact on the world, and also on how the world sees Africa. \"The more films we produce, the more people will see the different sides of life in Kenya.\" In the future, Claire Njoki wants to stay in Kenya to help grow the film industry and change the perception people have of her country. \"I want to tell more stories from Kenya - good stories, sad stories of humanity and togetherness and love,\" she said. \"I believe that people in Hollywood are not the only ones who can make good films, we are showing we can make good films so my biggest aim is to stay in Kenya, grow the industry and tell our stories.\" Putting Kenya on screen\nIt\u0027s not just about changing perceptions. Wilfred says that developing the film and TV industry could make a huge economic contribution. \"Just one project is able to employ more than 100 people and the trend globally is that film crews are getting larger and big studios are increasing their budgets,\" he says. \"If we can get our films to a larger market, we are talking many thousands of possible jobs. We have realised we can create content and now we need to learn how to sell it,\" says Wilfred. The school has a foundation which funds places for students from low-income backgrounds, and many of its students come from the slums of Nairobi. \"We have a lot of kids from the slums and you see the transformation in one year,\" says Wilfred. \"They start getting gigs, dressing better, they change and they start hanging out with people who can develop their career.\" \u0027Move their parents out of the slums\u0027\nBut he says it can be difficult to convince parents that their children can make a career from film. \"My mum was the same - she didn\u0027t understand why I wanted to make films when I could do accounting instead,\" he said. \"Parents always ask me if their child will be successful.\" But he is adamant that the success of ADMI\u0027s graduates show that working in film can \"transform\" Kenyans\u0027 lives. \"It does pay well and, in future, our students will be able to move their parents out of the slums,\" he says. The school is now looking to set up collaborations with other colleges and companies around the world, and to persuade audiences to take a chance on African films. But until Sunday, they can be forgiven for focusing only on the Oscars. If Watu Wote wins, expect more tears from Claire and her mum.

{"hash":"9686b90f2a935b1f8619d4002b6e9e0f","title":"Drink up","author":"bbc","feed":"business","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43196787","content":"Walking into a bar in India, it is hard to miss the bottles of Bira 91 beer. Featuring a cartoon monkey with a punk hairdo and one eye smaller than the other, the labels read: \"Imagined in India\". Despite only launching in 2015, Bira 91 is now immensely popular across a country dominated by ubiquitous Kingfisher. Entrepreneur Ankur Jain started the brand when he moved back to his native New Delhi after 10 years living in New York. Noticing a gap in the Indian market for craft beers - beers more flavourful and carefully brewed than mass-market lager - he decided to start his own brewing business with $600,000 (£427,000) of funding raised largely from friends and family. The company began operations out of Hauz Khas Village, a neighbourhood often considered to be Delhi\u0027s hipster haven, and known for its bars and artsy boutiques. Yet while the Bira 91 head office is in Delhi, the brewing was initially done 4,000 miles (6,400 km) away in Belgium, hence the slogan \"imagined in India\" rather than \"brewed in India\". Mr Jain says he went to Belgium because he couldn\u0027t initially find a brewery in India that he thought was good enough. With the Belgians being world renowned for their brewing expertise, Bira 91\u0027s two initial beers were quickly a hit in India. So much so that Bira 91 couldn\u0027t import the bottles quickly enough, and in 2016 it started making the beers at a facility in the central Indian city of Indore. By the end of last year, annual production had increased 30-fold to 300,000 barrels of five different beers, and the company\u0027s annual revenues had reached $30m. At the same time Bira 91 had secured $35m of external investment, including from US venture capital firm Sequoia Capital. Mr Jain now has his eyes set on worldwide sales, and you cannot accuse him of not being ambitious. \"The intent is to become the first global brand of craft beer,\" he says. Bira 91 (the 91 comes from India\u0027s international dialling code) already exports its beers to the US, specifically to New York and New Jersey. It first started selling in those two states in 2016, after deciding to push the brand by sponsoring that year\u0027s Tribeca Film Festival in New York City. \"Our brand is in the middle of extreme hipsterdom and extreme mainstream,\" says Mr Jain. \"Metaphorically Tribeca [a neighbourhood of New York City] is that too - it\u0027s not the Upper East Side, and it\u0027s not Brooklyn - so it worked for us.\" Currently Bira 91 exports 2% of its Indian production to the US, but plans to increase that as it expands into Philadelphia and Boston. It also intends to start brewing in New York in the near future. And it hopes to be selling into Singapore, Hong Kong and Bangkok by the end of 2018. Now with 320 employees, Mr Jain says that he recently felt a need to reduce operational inertia in the company, and foster a culture of openness to new ideas. \"My active attempt was to ensure that a lot more people have decision-making empowerment,\" says the founder and chief executive. To do this Mr Jain decided to flatten the organisational structure of the business. His fellow directors saw their senior job titles and assigned seats in offices taken away, and now employees at Bira 91 sit around the same dinner tables, allowing junior and senior employees to freely exchange ideas. Bira 91 also opened a second Indian brewery last year in the central Indian city of Nagpur, and a third is planned for 2018. Brewing expert Sandeep Bhatnagar cautions that if Bira 91 is to substantially increase its exports, it will have to put a big focus on making the best beer it possibly can. \"Companies like Bira, when they want to explore international markets, they have to be very cautious about the quality that they are going to manufacture,\" says Mr Bhatnagar, who is managing director of Ambicon Consultants, a company that helps set up microbreweries and brewpubs. \"They are talking about taking it to various Asian countries, and that market is entirely different to the Indian market. The Indian beer market is still not mature, but those places are. \"So if someone is trying to venture into a place where people have knowledge about beer, that person has to be very careful.\" Advertising alcoholic drinks in India is also a challenge for Bira 91, since it is banned. As a result, companies have to turn to alternative ways to promote their products. Some brands opt for surrogate advertising, and promote alternative non-alcohol products, such as sodas or even music festivals, that have the same brand name. Bira 91 associates itself with food and music, particularly India hip-hop artists, and has a visual presence at events such as the prominent Indian music festival Magnetic Fields. Mr Jain says: \"We want to be part of the whole hip-hop revolution in India.\" Aanchal Chauhan, Bira 91\u0027s digital marketing head, adds: \"People will start relating hip-hop with Bira. \"We want to make it a cross-cultural movement, with artist collaborations in India and abroad.\" The company also uses social media extensively, across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. As Bira 91 pushes forward with its plans for international expansion, it intends to ultimately replicate the India model of collaborating with musical talent. While it will face a big challenge breaking into more established beer markets, already cluttered with a host of craft beers, and with their own laws and regulations, Mr Bhatnagar is confident that Bira 91 will make a success of it. \"If they have done it in India, they can do it anywhere else,\" he says.

Mr Nunberg said Mr Trump was aware of a 2016 meeting between his aides and a Russian lawyer, and may have \"done something\" during the campaign. Democrat Adam Schiff responded by saying his congressional panel \"needs to explore\" Mr Nunberg\u0027s allegation. Mr Nunberg is the latest figure to become embroiled in the Russia inquiry. \"Certainly if Mr Nunberg has light to shed about what the president knew about the Trump Tower meeting, we would like to find out,\" Mr Schiff said, referring to his House Intelligence Committee\u0027s investigation on Monday night. US President Donald Trump has denied any knowledge of that meeting, which has become a central focus of a separate inquiry by special counsel Robert Mueller into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin. Congressman Mike Conway, who serves as leading chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, dismissed the idea of calling Mr Nunberg to testify, saying of the Trump Tower meeting: \"I think we\u0027ve pretty much explored that to death.\" Mr Nunberg, who lost his job in 2015, complained in a series of remarkable interviews on Monday about being asked to share his email conversations with a long list of ex-campaign aides in response to a subpoena from Mr Mueller\u0027s team. The political operative, who helped launch Donald Trump\u0027s presidential campaign, said in a round of media interviews at first he would not comply with Mr Mueller\u0027s demand to testify before a grand jury. But he later told the Associated Press he would probably end up complying. \"I think it would be really, really funny if they wanted to arrest me because I don\u0027t want to spend 80 hours going over emails,\" he told MSNBC. While he thought investigators believed they had something on Mr Trump, he argued that the subpoena was unfair and added he would like Robert Mueller\u0027s team to narrow its scope of inquiry. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders would not be drawn on Mr Nunberg\u0027s remarks, saying: \"I\u0027m not going to weigh in on somebody that doesn\u0027t work at the White House.\" Who is Nunberg?\nSam Nunberg worked on the Trump campaign in 2015 until he was fired in August that year over racially charged Facebook posts. He was later sued by Mr Trump for $10m (£7.2m) for breach of confidentiality. The lawsuit was \"amicably settled\" out of court, a lawyer for the Trump Organization said at the time. \u0027He knew\u0027 about Trump Tower meeting\nMr Nunberg said Mr Trump was aware at the time of a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower when a group of Russians offered his campaign staff damaging information about Hillary Clinton. \"You know he knew about it,\" Mr Nunberg told CNN. \"He was talking about it a week before. I don\u0027t know why he went around trying to hide it.\" The White House has repeatedly denied Mr Trump knew anything about that meeting. \u0027Arrest me\u0027\nDuring Monday\u0027s interviews with US media, Mr Nunberg said he had met Mr Mueller\u0027s team for five-and-a-half hours over the weekend. He said he would not appear before a grand jury to testify on Friday. \"I\u0027m not co-operating. Arrest me,\" Mr Nunberg said on live television. \"You want to arrest me? Arrest me.\" \u0027They suspect something\u0027\nAt times during the interviews, Mr Nunberg appeared to contradict himself. He said: \"Trump may very well have done something during the election with the Russians. If he did that, I don\u0027t know.\" But Mr Nunberg also told CNN\u0027s Jake Tapper: \"It\u0027s the biggest joke to ever think Donald Trump colluded with the Russians.\" ","date":1520363337000,"topics":["Robert Mueller","Donald Trump"]}

China\u0027s biggest conglomerates have been snapping up businesses around the world, including some in fairly sexy sectors. Despite growing so big and borrowing so much, they were seen as untouchable because of their political connections. That was until the middle of last year when, after seemingly unrestrained growth, Beijing suddenly turned up the heat on some of those giants. And then last week, some real action. Beijing cracked down on one of those firms - taking control of insurance and financial giant Anbang, and prosecuting the firm\u0027s head. This, analysts suggest, could indicate more intervention is on the way. Who might be next?\nThe move against Anbang was called a \"warning shot\" by the Economist Intelligence Unit. But it is just one of the businesses which became known as \"grey rhinos\" - large, visible problems in an economy which are often ignored, until they start moving fast and trampling everything in their wake. And next in Beijing\u0027s crosshairs, analysts predict, is likely to be HNA, which has been described as the biggest company you\u0027ve probably never heard of. Investing an estimated $40bn (£28.7bn) in the past three years, it differs from Anbang having primarily bought into \"real businesses\" rather than being built mainly around complex financial structures. It owns China\u0027s Hainan Airlines, airport services firm Swissport, airline caterer Gate Gourmet, holds a major stake in Deutsche Bank, has a 25% share in the Hilton hotel group, and owns Carlson Hotels, which runs the Radisson chain. While there\u0027s no suggestion it\u0027s in financial difficulties, expect Beijing to lean on HNA to get rid of \"most if not all of its financial sector holdings\", says Michael Hirson of analysts Eurasia Group. Earlier this month, HNA said it had reduced its stake in Deutsche Bank from 9.9% to 9.2%. While most of Anbang\u0027s investors were individuals putting cash into things such as insurance policies, HNA\u0027s backers are mainly institutions. On the one hand, this would mean its collapse would be far less politically sensitive. The common man or woman on the street rarely sheds tears when financial giants get their fingers burned. But Eurasia Group says we should not expect a too punitive approach from the government. \"Beijing is reluctant to impose major losses on bondholders, which would make it more expensive for many other Chinese corporates to obtain external financing,\" Mr Hirson said. Significant bankruptcies would also carry political risks. HNA hasn\u0027t commented. But speaking last year to the BBC, chief executive Adam Tan was sanguine about plans by Beijing to tighten restrictions on Chinese businesses spending money abroad. He predicted HNA would still get support from Chinese banks, and could count on international banks as well because of its large presence outside of China. It seems unlikely he will feel so secure today. What about Dalian Wanda?\nOf all the Chinese firms facing a crackdown, Dalian Wanda has the highest profile overseas, partly because of the sort of investments it made. Run by Wang Jianlin, among the country\u0027s richest men, it grew into one of the country\u0027s most prominent property developers. And it invested overseas too, most noticeably in Hollywood - controlling the AMC cinema chain as well as Legendary Entertainment, co-producer of hit films such as Godzilla and The Dark Knight Rises. But Mr Wang, once considered a Beijing favourite, fell foul of the establishment, with lenders told to pull out their backing. And after the warnings came he was quick to offload businesses, including theme parks and hotels in one of China\u0027s biggest property deals as it focused on its core shopping mall and cinema businesses. A subsequent rejigging of the deal just added to the picture of chaos. Earlier it had pulled out of a $1bn bid for Dick Clark Productions - the owner of the Golden Globe TV and film awards - with China\u0027s clampdown on overseas investments blamed. Michael Hirson of Eurasia Group described the asset selling as \"aggressive moves\" to \"de-risk\". They were, he added, \"a painful decision for Wang but one that now looks very astute\". Who else is in the spotlight?\nThe other big player put on the watch list in mid-2017 was Fosun. It has investments in the English football club Wolverhampton Wanderers, leisure group Club Med, travel firm Thomas Cook and entertainments business Cirque de Soleil. And unlike the others, is still buying abroad. Just last week, it said it had completed a deal to become the majority shareholder in Lanvin, France\u0027s oldest surviving couture label. Though by its standards, the investment of about $120m is fairly small. Both Wanda and Fosun \"appear to be on more solid political ground\", according to Mr Hirson. What does this mean for Chinese overseas investment?\nThe clampdown is very much aimed at the large conglomerates buying into a huge range of sectors. Most other firms are able to keep investing. But there has been a fall from the peak years of 2015 and 2016. The number of Chinese deals in the US and Europe fell by almost 25% in 2017 from the previous year, Dealogic said. And the rhetoric against Chinese investment in the US from the Trump administration - as seen in the collapse of some major deals - means this trend is likely to continue. Just this week, Germany said it would be watching closely after Geely snapped up nearly 10% of Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler. Why was Anbang targeted?\nTo recap from last week, Anbang firm was known for its aggressive international acquisitions, including New York\u0027s Waldorf Astoria hotel. But Chinese authorities have been cracking down on the financial industry to guard against excessive borrowing and risk. The firm\u0027s head Wu Xiaohui, who was already detained by authorities last June, is to face prosecution for \"economic crimes\". Analysts at Eurasia Group described it as \"both a takedown and a bailout\". \"Beijing\u0027s approach reveals President Xi Jinping\u0027s approach to cracking down on conglomerates - punish wrong-doing by executives while sending a reassuring message to the markets,\" said Eurasia Group\u0027s Michael Hirson. China could have nationalised Anbang instead (as, for example, happened during the UK banking crisis in 2008 with Royal Bank of Scotland). Or it might have forced its sale to another company (continuing the UK analogy, look at how HBOS was sold to Lloyds Banking Group). Instead it put it under the stewardship of China\u0027s insurance regulator for one year. This, notes Mr Hirson was a \"relatively transparent and investor-friendly\" approach, allowing the regulators to sell-off Anbang assets and bring in funds while keeping it out of state ownership.

The 23-time Grand Slam singles champion will return to the WTA Tour at Indian Wells in California this week. In an interview with BBC Sport, the 36-year-old American said she is motivated by the thought of playing long enough for her six-month-old daughter to have memories of watching her. \"It\u0027s been hard,\" she said. \"There have been so many days, even still, when I\u0027m like, \u0027how am I going to keep going?\u0027 \"It\u0027s been really, really difficult but I keep going and I know that I might not be at my best yet, but I\u0027m getting there and every day is a new day and every day I should be getting better. \"As long as I\u0027m moving forward, even if it\u0027s at a turtle\u0027s pace, then I\u0027m OK with that.\" Williams was speaking before competing at the Tiebreak Tens event at New York\u0027s Madison Square Garden. In an article for CNN last month, she wrote she feels \"lucky to have survived\" Alexis Olympia\u0027s birth, having suffered a pulmonary embolism after an emergency Caesarean section. But now, having played an exhibition match in Abu Dhabi in late December and a doubles rubber for the US Fed Cup team against the Netherlands last month, she says the time is right for her to return. \"I\u0027m ready, or else I wouldn\u0027t be here,\" she said. \"If I\u0027m not ready now, I\u0027m just never going to be ready. I feel in two months I\u0027ll be way better than I am now, but you have to start somewhere. I don\u0027t want to keep sitting on the sidelines and thinking about it.\" Williams can take encouragement from her performance in New York on Monday. Her serve looked threatening and she hit some menacing winners as she beat another returning player - Marion Bartoli - before losing to Zhang Shuai in the semi-finals. Media playback is not supported on this device Williams last appeared in a Grand Slam at the 2017 Australian Open. Victory over sister Venus in the final left her just one behind Margaret Court\u0027s all-time record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles. She has made no secret of the fact she is motivated by the thought of winning 25. And also by giving her daughter a meaningful chance to watch her play. \"I don\u0027t need any more motivation,\" Williams said. \"I have the best thing I could ever want right now. I\u0027ve always been an extremely motivated person, but my main thing is that I would love for my daughter to be around with me doing great, and playing amazing, so that definitely gives me some motivation. \"I would have thought I would have retired six years ago, but I\u0027m still here and I\u0027m playing great, and I think I\u0027ll still be playing good.\" She added it was \"impossible\" to say how long she would continue to play for. Williams, who is unranked as she has spent more than 12 months away from the tour, has been drawn to play Zarina Diyas of Kazakhstan in the first round in Indian Wells. The match is likely to be played on Thursday evening, Californian time. She could play her sister Venus in the third round, but has understandably sounded a note of caution. After all, the former world number one only gave birth six months ago, and six weeks of that time was spent in bed as she recovered from emergency surgery. \"My expectations, I don\u0027t know what they are,\" said Williams. \"I can\u0027t go and say I expect to lose because that is something I will never say. It\u0027s just a little different. I\u0027m just expecting to see where I am more than anything. \"This is a good time to start for the summer. If I want to play in those Grand Slams [the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open] and play well, I think now is the perfect time to start.\" The only mother to have won the Wimbledon singles title since World War One was Australia\u0027s Evonne Cawley (nee Goolagong) in 1980.

Hooker Hartley, 31, has tightness in his calf and will be monitored before Thursday\u0027s team announcement. Exeter\u0027s Nowell rolled an ankle injury in training and will play no further part in the tournament. Bath flanker Sam Underhill has also been ruled out of the France game. The 21-year-old sustained a toe injury in training but could return for England\u0027s final game against Ireland. Nowell, 24, and Underhill have both featured off the bench in all three of England\u0027s matches so far in the championship, but have now returned to their clubs. According to England forwards coach Steve Borthwick, Northampton\u0027s Hartley and Exeter prop Harry Williams, 26, have reported muscle tightness, but at this stage both are expected to be fit. \"Dylan trained fully yesterday and just had a bit of tightness afterwards. There will be ongoing assessment on a daily basis,\" Borthwick told BBC 5 live. Luke Cowan-Dickie has been called up as \"precautionary cover\" for Hartley, while Kyle Sinckler is in camp as back-up to Williams. If Hartley is unable to recover then Jamie George is in line to start in Paris, with Owen Farrell taking over the captaincy. Sam Simmonds will come back into contention after returning from injury, while experienced flanker James Haskell is also set to be included in the matchday 23. Defending champions England are currently second in the table behind Ireland, having lost to Scotland at Murrayfield in their last outing. ","date":1520346426000,"topics":[]}

The car, driven by Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne, broke down three times on day one of the final test in Barcelona. The first two failures were caused by a battery problem, the third a loss of hydraulic pressure. McLaren completed the fewest laps on Tuesday and Vandoorne was 12th fastest of the 13 drivers taking part. McLaren headed into the pre-season tests following their switch from Honda to Renault engines with hopes of competing for podium finishes this season. They split with Honda last season after three seasons of poor performance and reliability and claimed that they had a chassis that was on about the same level as Red Bull. They have expectations of competing this year with the four-time champions, who also use a Renault engine. \"We aren\u0027t overly concerned about the issues that we\u0027ve faced today,\" said McLaren racing director Eric Boullier. \"It\u0027s obviously not the productive day we had planned, but the problems are the types of niggles that we almost hope and expect to face during testing, in order to prepare us properly for the season ahead. \"We are here to test, and today is what sometimes happens in testing. It\u0027s not ideal, and we would have liked more track time, but we\u0027re working on it, we\u0027re learning from it.\" It is always difficult to judge a team\u0027s actual competitive position from pre-season testing because the specification in which the cars are running is not made public. But, with three days of testing remaining before the first race in Australia on 23-25 March, the McLaren car\u0027s apparent lack of reliability and pace is a major concern. A succession of issues have restricted mileage in testing. Fernando Alonso lost a wheel after just six laps of the first day of testing last week because a nut had not been tightened properly. The following day Vandoorne was hit by overheating in the engine bay caused by a broken exhaust clip. The final two days of the first test were rendered largely useless by poor weather. The second test started with two early problems in the morning session on Tuesday - the car cut out on its way into the pits after an early run, and then after setting his first lap time, Vandoorne ground to a halt on the pit straight. He managed eight laps in total in the morning after the team managed to get the car back out just before the lunch break. Vandoorne had increased his tally to 38 laps when the hydraulic problem hit midway through the afternoon. The team were unable to get him out on track again. McLaren racing director Eric Boullier said at the end of last week\u0027s first test that doing a race distance this week was \"key\", but the team seem far from that at this stage. By comparison, Ferrari and Mercedes both did more than 160 laps - nearly three race distances - on Tuesday. If McLaren\u0027s problems continue, it would mean a fourth consecutive wasted season for two-time champion Fernando Alonso, who re-signed for McLaren last autumn in expectation of a better season. Alonso, winner of 32 grands prix and still regarded at the age of 36 as one of the greatest drivers of his era, left Ferrari at the end of 2014 having lost faith in their ability to win the title again before the end of his contract, which ran to 2016. But while the Italian team have remained Mercedes\u0027 closest challengers in the intervening period - and were title contenders last season - Alonso has been far worse off in the McLaren, his best results a handful of fifth places. McLaren\u0027s troubles have been put in stark relief by Honda\u0027s generally reliable running with new partners Toro Rosso, the Red Bull junior team. Toro Rosso driver Pierre Gasly ended the day fifth fastest, behind Sebastian Vettel\u0027s Ferrari, Mercedes\u0027 Valtteri Bottas, Red Bull\u0027s Max Verstappen and world champion Lewis Hamilton, who took over the Mercedes from Bottas at lunch time. However, Toro Rosso also hit trouble on Tuesday, the car failing to get out of the pits at all in the afternoon session. And Verstappen was another driver to stop on track in the afternoon. Vettel\u0027s fastest time of one minute 20.396 seconds was set on the \u0027medium\u0027 tyre and put him 0.2secs ahead of Bottas on the theoretically faster \u0027soft\u0027 tyre. Verstappen was just 0.053secs slower than the Mercedes on the medium. The opening race of the 2018 season is the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne\u0027s Albert Park on 23-25 March. Fastest times, first day, morning session 1. Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Ferrari 1:20.396 2. Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Mercedes 1:20.596 * 3. Max Verstappen (Ned) Red Bull-Renault 1:20.649 4.

But Guardiola said: \"It is not about independence. It is about people being in jail when they did nothing to deserve it.\" The FA took action when former Barcelona manager Guardiola wore the yellow ribbon pitchside - he is free to wear it elsewhere - during Man City\u0027s FA Cup fifth-round defeat at Wigan on 19 February.

In the middle of a basketball gymnasium, Stanton \"Mikey\" Robinson, 30, sat with all of his worldly possessions. Fighting back tears he explained his dream of having a small apartment with a small table and a single bed. \"I don\u0027t like it in here. I don\u0027t feel comfortable in this place,\" he told us. \"(tell the government to) Please help me.\" Twenty metres away on what\u0027s meant to be spectator seating, Makeba Hesky, 34, sat nursing her 10-month-old child. A large hole - unpatched since the hurricane - in the roof of the BVI Sports Complex allowed rain and light to pour into the otherwise unlit gymnasium. \"It seems to me like everybody just give up on us,\" Hesky said. Hesky and Robinson are among the approximately 20 people still living in the shelter who have faced repeated deadlines to move out despite nowhere to go. Many more are living with friends and family. Outside the sports complex and across the islands, signs of Irma\u0027s (destructive) visit can still be seen everywhere - not least at the island\u0027s government building. Most of the structure\u0027s windows are boarded, awaiting replacement. Inside, the island\u0027s premier, Orlando Smith, works from a sparse office while repairmen are still labouring to repair the extensive damage. Asked if he could guarantee that those in the shelter would not be thrown out with nowhere to go, Smith told the BBC, \"that\u0027s why they\u0027re still there… we\u0027re looking to provide the necessary accommodation for them\". The \"biggest priority is housing - getting those roofs back on, getting people in homes,\" he said, speaking outside his office. \"Then of course, there is the matter of the economy. We\u0027ve got to get that economy back up and running.\" Economically speaking, the islands\u0027 tourism sector took the biggest hit. Few know that better than Roselyn Hill. She like many others here worked in the tourism industry for decades, only to be laid off when Irma damaged the resorts and attractions at which they worked. \"Peak season a couple of years ago - sometimes it looks like more boats than water. You can\u0027t see the water for the yachts,\" she said, standing on a cruise ship dock that (now lies) laid empty. Two of the biggest cruise companies have stopped bringing ships to the BVI, and the reduced numbers of tourists has meant a slow recovery for the tourism industry. \"It\u0027s not a good feeling you know back then to compare it to now,\" she said. \"When we see a cruise ship, it\u0027s like light\". The hardships have caused many to question whether the United Kingdom did enough to support those on the islands. Across town, Rita Plunkett was doing her washing on a day off. Stepping inside, she explained how windows and doors to her home were broken during the storm and pointed to massive water damage to a bedroom ceiling. On the roof of her apartment building, bits of UK Aid-branded tarpaulin stood between her and regular rainstorms. She said the UK\u0027s response came up short. She received, \"no aid, apart from the six bottles of water I got - that was it,\" she said. It was a common perception we have heard here over the past few days - that other than the work done by British troops in the month after the storm, more could have been done. Upon returning from a preaching trip to the island of Virgin Gorda, Bishop John Cline went a step further than most we spoke with. \"When we did need them to show that we are truly a child of the United Kingdom, I think they disappointed us,\" he said. \"It changed our view in terms of a relationship, to saying \u0027are we really a part of you or is that just in name only?\u0027\" But the island\u0027s British governor, Gus Jaspert, says he\u0027s proud of the UK\u0027s contribution to the BVI\u0027s recovery - noting that much of Britain\u0027s work has been behind the scenes. \"The UK had a very first visible phase, which was military out and about. People saw that a lot more,\" he said. \"Behind the scenes, the UK has been supporting with infrastructure, supporting with technical advisors in each of the key departments and ministries… as well as grants on specific projects - both on immediate needs, but also on longer term. \"(Together) we\u0027ve got the electricity back on. We\u0027ve got businesses back open. We\u0027ve got all children getting educated, and key services are back up and running,\" he said, while acknowledging that much work still remained. The governor is right about progress being made. Given the scale of the destruction even removing debris has been a huge feat, albeit one that is still ongoing. The island\u0027s main high school lies in ruin. Many other schools appear damaged. Harbours are littered with overturned and abandoned boats - some boats lay where they washed up on land. Roads are littered with potholes. And some debris remains strewn about. And now, with hurricane season less than 100 days away, many island residents are worried about what the next storm may bring.

The company said it would screen new and existing photos and remove pictures featuring weapons from the app. However, military and law enforcement officers in uniform will be allowed to show weapons in their photos. Bumble said it was taking \"an opportunity to make our platform safer\". \"As mass shootings continue to devastate communities across the country, it\u0027s time to state unequivocally that gun violence is not in line with our values, nor do these weapons belong on Bumble,\" the company said in a statement. In February, 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Since then, survivors have campaigned for stricter gun control in the US. Bumble says it has 30 million members worldwide, and the company already employs 5,000 moderators. They will now filter out photos of guns in addition to nudity, knives and hate speech. However, photos displayed on a Bumble profile from a linked Instagram account will not be screened. \"Online behaviour can both mirror and predict how people treat each other in the real world. Bumble has a responsibility to our users and a larger goal to encourage accountability offline,\" the company said in a statement. The app\u0027s founder Whitney Wolfe Herd acknowledged that the ban would affect law-abiding gun owners, hobbyists and hunters. \"It\u0027s a very tricky battle we\u0027ve chosen to take on, but I\u0027d rather pursue this than just ignore it,\" she told the New York Times. The company has also donated $100,000 (£72,000) to the March For Our Lives campaign, which was founded by survivors of the Parkland shooting. \"We stand with them, and join them in working towards a non-violent future,\" the company said.

The scammers pose as celebrities on Twitter and claim to be giving away crypto-cash such as Bitcoin or Ether to their fans. They ask people to send them a small amount of crypto-currency to qualify for the giveaway, but victims do not get any bitcoins back. Twitter has not yet removed the imposter Elon Musk account. How does the scam work?\nThe scammers impersonate well-known personalities on Twitter by copying their profile pictures and choosing usernames very similar to the genuine accounts. They then post replies to popular tweets made by the genuine celebrity. This gives their nefarious messages prominence on Twitter. Typically, the scammers ask people to send them small amounts of crypto-currency, offering to send a larger amount back as part of a giveaway. The scam can be convincing, because at first glance it looks like the celebrity has replied to their own tweet. However, the fake profiles can be detected as they do not have Twitter\u0027s \"verified\" badge and often have no followers and have never posted before. Amplified by bots\nOn Tuesday, an account posing as Elon Musk using the username @elonmuskik tweeted that the entrepreneur was going to \"give away\" 3,000 Ether, worth about £1.7m. The scam was amplified by several automated accounts known as bots. The bots had been dormant since September 2017 and had never posted before, but came to life to chat among themselves about the supposed crypto-cash giveaway. \"Sо nice! Just sent and immediately received back. You\u0027re super fast,\" one said. The founder of the Ethereum (ETH) crypto-currency Vitalik Buterin has been targeted by the scam so many times that he has changed his username to \"No I\u0027m not giving away ETH\". \"No, I\u0027m not giving away ETH... y\u0027all are getting nothing,\" he tweeted. Twitter has been criticised for taking a long time to tackle the problem of bots on its platform. It told the BBC: \"We\u0027re aware of this form of manipulation and are proactively implementing a number of signals to prevent these types of accounts from engaging with others in a deceptive manner.\" At the time of publication, the fake Elon Musk post had been up on the platform for 11 hours and remained visible.

At present, owners are required to keep drones within their own line of sight unless they have been given special permission to do otherwise. The new system is being co-developed by the air traffic control service Nats and a start-up, Altitude Angel. They aim to launch it in 2019 or 2020. The aim is to keep the lower-level air space, to which drones would still be restricted, safe. That means preventing drones crashing into each other as well as eliminating the risk to passenger jets and other manned aircraft, which are already tracked. \"This technology will enable us to be able to create a single picture so we can see where everyone is intending to fly and where they are already flying,\" the head of drones at Nats, Andrew Sage, told the BBC. \"Altitude Angel has a lot of expertise in data management that we don\u0027t have within Nats... and we are deploying that technology so we can react more quickly.\" He added that the initiative should also help tackle the number of near-misses between drones and planes, which have been on the rise. The two organisations had previously collaborated to develop an app used to provide guidance to drone pilots about safe places to fly. Drone deliveries\nNats says it has already had conversations with the drone industry and believes trials of the new system could begin within the UK before the end of 2018. Unmanned aircraft would still need to be fitted with technology to allow their locations to be shared, as well as sensors and software to react independently to collision threats. Mr Sage predicted that blood deliveries and search-and-rescue missions would be among early uses of drones that could fly beyond their operators\u0027 sightlines. But another expert said companies such as Amazon might be keen to shift parts of their logistics operations off the road. \"Drones flying beyond line of sight would be a very big deal - the scope of operations just changes dramatically,\" commented Dr Ravi Vaidyanathan, from Imperial College London. \"Goods deliveries would be one example of how it could be put to use, because products could be sent from a warehouse to a distant location. \"One could argue that if a drone has to be limited to being within line of sight, as at present, then it\u0027s probably easier to drop the package off yourself.\" ","date":1520341421000,"topics":["Drones"]}

It is in direct opposition to the Federal Communications Commission regulator, which has moved to roll back net neutrality. At least 20 other states are considering similar legislation. Some states have banned agencies from doing business with broadband providers that don\u0027t uphold net neutrality. Net neutrality is the principle that all internet traffic should be treated equally. In December the FCC voted to repeal the rules, in what was seen as a major victory for the telecoms industry. Chairman Aji Pai argued that it would lead to greater investment in broadband infrastructure because service providers would have new avenues to make money. But a vocal and growing list of opponents, including tech firms and public interest groups, have promised to mount legal challenges to preserve the rules which they say are at the heart of what makes for a fair internet. Free flow\nWashington State governor Jay Inslee said at the signing ceremony: \"We\u0027ve seen the power of an open internet. It allows a student in Washington to connect with researchers all around the world -  or a small business to compete in the global marketplace. \"It has allowed the free flow of information and ideas in one of the greatest demonstrations of free speech in our history.\" The decision in Washington means that internet service providers may have to have a different set of policies there compared to other states that they operate in. Net neutrality supporters in Congress are trying to overturn the new law through legislation. California is also considering its own state law to preserve net neutrality. Senator Scott Wiener introduced the legislation in January, saying net neutrality \"was essential to our 21st century democracy\". \"We won\u0027t let the Trump-led FCC dismantle our right to a free and open internet, and we won\u0027t let them create a system where internet providers can favour websites and services based on who pays more money.\" The final draft of the rules takes place on April 23, which will be the day the repeal takes effect.

Details of an age verification tool developed by a major porn site owner were revealed at the weekend. From April 2018, porn site visitors in the UK will have to prove they are aged 18 or over to access adult material. The regulation is designed to protect children from explicit content. It is part of the UK government\u0027s Digital Economy Act. MindGeek, which runs sites including PornHub, YouPorn and RedTube, said its AgeID age verification tool had been in use in Germany since 2015. It said its software would use \"third-party age-verification companies\" to authenticate the age of those signing in. AgeID spokesman James Clark told the BBC there were multiple verification methods that could be used - including credit card, mobile SMS, passport and driving licence - but that it was not yet clear which would be compliant with the law. AgeID would be made commercially available to all porn sites accessible within the UK, MindGeek said, and would be offered free to independent UK studios, producers and bloggers. Once registered, users would be able to access multiple sites across multiple devices without logging in again, it said. MindGeek also said it would not store any data itself. \"We have created a tool to comply with the impending UK legislation, which both protects children from stumbling across adult content, and enables those of legal age to securely and privately access adult websites through a one-time verification process,\" said Mr Clark. However, the tool will be effective only for those who go directly to porn sites rather than use search engines or follow social media hashtags that include pornographic content. These could be blocked by the parental controls offered by most internet service providers. Mr Clark said the scope of the regulations were a matter for the regulator, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), but that AgeID would work across MindGeek\u0027s network and all others that signed up to use it. Treasure trove\nMyles Jackman, legal director of the Open Rights Group, said while MindGeek had said it would not hold or store data, it was not clear who would - and by signing in people would be revealing their sexual preferences. \"If the age verification process continues in its current fashion, it\u0027s a once-in-a-lifetime treasure trove of private information,\" he said. \"If it gets hacked, can British citizens ever trust the government again with their data? \"The big issues here are privacy and security.\" Mr Jackman said it would drive more people to use virtual private networks (VPNs) - which mask a device\u0027s geographical location to circumvent local restrictions - or the anonymous web browser Tor. \"It is brutally ironic that when the government is trying to break all encryption in order to combat extremism, it is now forcing people to turn towards the dark web,\" he said. The chief executive of the BBFC, David Austin, said age verification was already in place for other services, including some video-on-demand sites. \"This is not about stopping adults from watching pornography that is legal; it is about making the internet a safer place for children,\" he said. \"There are a range of methods for verifying whether someone is 18 or over, and we expect to see a number of solutions offered by providers to give people different ways to verify their age.\" ","date":1520294859000,"topics":["Privacy","Cyber-security","Pornography"]}

{"hash":"f0410cd0605c01928dac26a19e2efcf5","title":"Satellite links to optimise European airspace","author":"bbc","feed":"tech","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-43307812","content":"The European Space Agency and London\u0027s Inmarsat company are moving to the next phase of their project to improve the efficiency of European airspace. The pair\u0027s Iris programme would see air traffic controllers route planes via robust and secure satellite data links. At the moment, this management involves VHF radio voice messages - a system that will soon likely reach capacity. Additional technologies are therefore needed to cope with the expected growth in air traffic over the coming decades. Passenger demand is currently increasing by more than 5% a year globally with the European market among the busiest. Iris, which will now see a large-scale demonstration over the next 36 months, should help speed up the transmission of messages between controllers and cockpits; and ultimately aims to make full 4D trajectory management possible. \"Flight paths are defined by latitude, longitude, altitude and time - and Iris, because of its performance, allows us to determine those waypoints to plus or minus 2-3 seconds,\" explained Captain Mary McMillan, vice president of aviation safety and operational services at Inmarsat Aviation. \"With resilient and ubiquitous satellite downlink frequencies, controllers and aircraft will have the confidence to know that planes will be where they say they\u0027re going to be at the prescribed time - and that will enable us to put more aircraft into the available airspace and do it safely,\" she told BBC News. Iris has been in an R\u0026D phase for a number of years, with demonstrations restricted to some small experimental flights. This next phase, funded through a €42m contract from Esa to Inmarsat, will see the technology prepared and proven on a larger number of aircraft fitted with the necessary communications equipment. The messages will be sent over Inmarsat\u0027s L-band network of telecommunications spacecraft that sit high above the Earth. If all goes well, Iris would then be available for wide-scale adoption in the 2020s. Esa and Inmarsat have had to show that not only are satellite links robust and broad enough to carry the digital routing messages, but that the system as a whole can resist hacking. \"It has to be safe, but it also has to be trusted and resilient for cyber security,\" said Carlo Elia, the head of the telecommunications technologies, products and systems department at the space agency. Iris is a key element of the European Commission\u0027s Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research programme, also known as Sesar. This is developing a number of technologies to streamline the coordination of flights. At the moment, it is thought more than 40km is added to the average flight in Europe because routing is not optimised. If this can be improved there are obvious gains to be had for passengers in shorter flight times, and for airline operators in reduced fuel-use and emissions. Iris is one of a number of public-private partnerships that Esa now runs out of its telecoms HQ in Harwell, Oxfordshire. \"The agency aims always to help improve the competitiveness of Europe\u0027s satcom industry and to explore ways to enlarge markets. Iris is a typical case,\" said Carlo Elia. \"The other motivation for us of course is the clear societal and environmental benefits that come from such a project,\" he told BBC News. As well as Inmarsat, more than 30 companies across Europe are working on Iris, including prime partners CGI UK and Thales Alenia Space, Italy.

It follows leaks from news site The Daily Beast showing a Russian troll farm active on the website. Co-founder Steve Huffman said that it had removed \"a few hundred accounts\" suspected of being of Russian origin. In a blogpost, he said \"indirect propaganda\", which was more complex to spot and stop, was the biggest issue. \"For example, the Twitter account @TEN_GOP is now known to be run by a Russian agent. Its tweets were amplified by thousands of Reddit users, and sadly, from everything we can tell, these users are mostly American and appear to be unwittingly promoting Russian propaganda.\" Conspiracy theories\nMr Huffman added: \"I believe the biggest risk we face as Americans is our own ability to discern reality from nonsense, and this is a burden we all bear. \"I wish there was a solution as simple as banning all propaganda, but it\u0027s not that easy. Between truth and fiction are a thousand shades of grey. \"It\u0027s up to all of us—Redditors, citizens, journalists—to work through these issues.\" The @TEN_GOP account appeared to be run by Republicans in Tennessee. It tweeted a mix of pro-Trump content and conspiracy theories, as well as more obvious fake news stories. The Daily Beast investigation suggested no outright support of any particular candidate or viewpoint and concluded that Russia\u0027s aim was to provoke and divide Americans on the internet and, as a result, in the physical world too. Social media \u0027weapon\u0027\nSocial media platforms are under increased scrutiny from the US Congress over the issue of Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Facebook has given the Senate Intelligence Committee thousands of ads believed to have been purchased by Russian agents. The Washington Post reported that Reddit was now likely to be questioned over its involvement in the \"weaponisation of social media\" during the election. Special counsel Robert Mueller has charged 13 Russians with interfering in the US election, all of whom are linked to troll farm the Internet Research Agency. Meanwhile, pressure is mounting on Reddit to clean up the content on its platform. In February, it banned a group that was generating fake porn - imagery and videos that superimpose a person\u0027s face over an explicit photo or video without permission. This week, it emerged that another subreddit was sharing images of dead babies and animals being harmed. Mr Huffman said the company was aware of the group, which currently has nearly 19,000 subscribers, and that the community was \"under review\".

David Bunting said Mr Baylis from Twickenham, south-west London, died on Monday of natural causes after a long illness. Mr Baylis invented the Baygen clockwork radio in 1991. He was appointed CBE in 2015 after campaigning to make theft of intellectual property a white-collar crime. He said chatting with the Queen at the ceremony was \"like catching up with an old mate\". Mr Baylis had also worked as a film and TV stuntman and an aquatic showman. He had been seriously debilitated, having suffered from Crohn\u0027s disease, Mr Bunting said. Mr Baylis was previously awarded the OBE for his radio, which he designed after seeing a documentary about Aids in Africa that suggested educational radio programmes could help tackle the spread of the virus. He had said he received almost none of the profits from the invention because people took advantage of patent laws to sell other versions of it. In later life Mr Baylis advised other inventors on developing their ideas, and campaigned against theft of intellectual property. Mr Bunting, who runs Trevor Baylis Brands, said Mr Baylis had no living relatives. Analysis - Prof Will Stewart, The Institution of Engineering and Technology\nTrevor Baylis\u0027 wind-up radios could work anywhere. They were sold in the UK, but we weren\u0027t the intended market. What made them important was that they were designed for a Third-World application. They were aimed at Africa and places where mains electric power and access to batteries was a problem. The original one had a clockwork-like mechanism with a very ingenious double-spiral spring. It wound off one pulley onto another and would run for relatively short periods of time - about 15 minutes. Later versions lasted longer and were powered by rechargeable batteries. They were charged up with a crankable dynamo or could be plugged into the mains or solar energy panels, if available. Nelson Mandela would say fine things about them, and they won Trevor Baylis various prizes. But while the Baygens certainly sold and were used, their biggest impact was probably that they had been made by a First World engineer who cared about the Third World. There are now all sorts of inventions aimed at the developing world and it\u0027s a relatively common thing for young engineers to dedicate themselves to, but that didn\u0027t always used to be the case. I think Trevor Baylis deserves considerable credit for having kicked that off and for having served as an inspiration to many other young engineers and inventors.

The computers were stolen during four raids on data centres around Iceland. The country is a popular location for data centres because almost 100% of the power generated there comes from renewable sources. Two of the suspects are in custody, and nine have been released on bail. The stolen servers have not been recovered. The AP newswire said police were now contacting internet service provider (ISPs), electricians and storage units, asking them to report sudden spikes in power usage or other signs the stolen servers had been reconnected. The value of the stolen computers has been put at $2m (£1.45m). In February, Iceland\u0027s HS Orka power generation company said it was seeing an \"exponential\" rise in the amount of energy being used in these data centres to mine and verify crypto-currency transactions.

Putting a chip under your skin is not so very different from getting a piercing or tattoo, argued one of the panellists - except there was often less blood. For some, transhumanism - the theory that the human race can evolve beyond its physical and mental limitations with the help of technology - is a crucial part of the advancement of society. Bio-hacker Lepht Anonym has nine implants and strongly believes what she does will benefit humankind as well as her own curiosity. But she admits it can be painful. \"The magnets in my fingers really, really hurt. They hurt so much that your vision goes white for a bit. Really, really painful.\" The magnets allow her to sense electromagnetic radiation so she can tell if a device is on or off, whether a microwave is running and identify where power lines are. All of which, she admits, is \"not hugely useful\". She also has a chip under her skin that lets her interact with her phone and unlock doors. She hopes that the \"primitive results\" she has achieved can be used by other, more skilled people, to build something better. \"The bio-hacking community is a co-operative. It is about improving the quality of life for people but in a practical way.\" Hygiene issues\nNot everyone is a fan of the trend. Andreas Sjostrom, who leads CapGemini\u0027s global mobility practice, had an implant in 2015 which allowed him to download his customer number from airline tickets and get through security gates with a swipe of his hand. It got him noticed by security staff at the airport and worked but he has since become more cynical about the technology. \"In order for this to be widely used or adopted it has to improve on the current situation,\" he said. \"The hardware that reads such chips is designed for a flat surface such as you\u0027d find in a card,\" he explained, adding that chips in hands are often not recognised by the readers. \"And, if everyone is pressing their hands on the reader, that is less hygienic.\" It is estimated that more than 10,000 people around the world have chip implants in their bodies, making it far from mainstream but clearly a growing trend. The current range of implants includes magnets that are installed into fingertips, radio frequency identification chips (RFiD) implanted in hands, and even LED lights that can shine beneath the skin. Chips used for opening doors carry a unique serial number the can be read by a device attached to whatever you want to open and one chip can carry multiple numbers meaning you do not need a separate chip for everything you want to access. Amal Graafstra provides such implants via his firm Dangerous Things and thinks there are three good reasons to have an implant. \"We all carry with us keys, wallet and phone. These are major burdens, they are so important for modern life but everyone hates carrying them. \"With a simple implant that uses less energy and carries less risk than an ear-piercing, you can replace them.\" He is able to access not only his house but his car via the implant under his skin, although he admits that getting the device to work with his car required \"a bit of hacking\". But he envisions a future where chips can do far more - and that, he predicts, will attract more people to the community of bio-hacking. \"If someone could use an implant to get on the train, buy coffee, secure their computer, secure their data, get into their house, drive a car - all of these possible applications will compel a lot more adoption.\" For Matt Eagles, the implant he has in his brain is not a luxury so much as a necessity to cope with the Parkinson\u0027s disease he has had since he was a child. He has two 15cm electrodes that run deep into his brain and create two bumps on his head which he affectionately refers to as \"baby giraffe horns\". The implants are attached to a pulse generator in his chest, which disrupts the electrical signals to his brain and allows him to walk. \"They have given me back my dignity. When you struggle to turn over in bed at night or can\u0027t get out of bed to go to the bathroom, to be suddenly able to do so is a huge plus.\" It has also given him back confidence to pursue his love of photography - he was an accredited football photographer at the 2012 Olympics - and, perhaps most importantly, he has got married. Many regard medicine as being the real mainstream application for bio-hacking, from cochlear implants which improve hearing loss to smart pills that can be ingested and access, analyse and manipulate bodily functions. Some bio-hackers are ready to go one step further. In October 2017, Josiah Zayner, who has a doctorate in biochemistry and molecular biophysics from the University of Chicago, injected his arm with DNA from a gene-editing tool called Crispr. It is a stunt that he has since said he regrets but his attempt to edit his own genes - in this case to trigger a genetic change in his cells to increase muscle mass - made headlines at the time, largely around the ethics of such experimentation. \"There is a continuum between therapy and enhancement and it is difficult to draw the line between where medicine ends and enhancement begins,\" said Prof John Harris, an ethicist from the University of Manchester. \"As for gene editing the tools are available and relatively cheap and easy to use, but people would be extremely ill-advised to try it.\" There has also been objections on religious grounds from some, with Mr Sjostrom receiving negative feedback from a group in the Christian community. \"They see implantable technology and assume the end of times are here and that it is the mark of the beast. It is important to know how to deal with this technology from a theological point of view.\" ","date":1520049711000,"topics":[]}

In a White House briefing following the Florida school shooting, when press secretary Sarah Sanders was asked about the president\u0027s policy on gun control she said Donald Trump will \"be meeting with members of the video game industry to see what they can do on that front\". Ms Sanders response has been widely discussed on social media, with some criticising the president for pointing the finger at fictional guns, rather than actual firearms. You may also like: Some people wondered if they had inadvertently stumbled into the past, as the relationship between video games and violent behaviour has long been debated in the media.

Meanwhile, Twitter users have begun to question exactly who it is that Donald Trump intends on meeting. Video game journalist Jason Schreier tweeted that the Entertainment Software Association, whose members include many of the largest game publishers in the United States, says neither the ESA nor its members have been invited to a meeting. And if a meeting does happen, one person wondered how the meeting could go ahead without causing contention. Who is he going to meet with? Activision? EA? ID? Bungie? Valve? Nintendo? Also, since the video game industry has spent literally DECADES rejecting the idea that they’re to blame for violence, this sounds like a pretty contentious meeting in the making. https://t.co/YD5J1ejsnr End of Twitter post by @jackmjenkins ","date":1520001223000,"topics":["Donald Trump"]}

It said it hoped to work with \"outside experts\" and is inviting proposals. Its chief executive, Jack Dorsey, said the platform\u0027s \"instant, public, global messaging\" had \"real-world negative consequences\" that Twitter had neither fully predicted nor understood. Twitter has repeatedly been criticised for the amount of abuse and propaganda posted by some of its users. In support of its new stance, Mr Dorsey tweeted a link to an organisation called Cortico. It identifies \"shared attention\", \"shared reality\" (which it describes as \"using the same facts\"), variety of opinion and reception to different views as indicators of a healthy public conversation. Lisa-Maria Neudert, from the Oxford Internet Institute, said it was a positive step to see Twitter prepared to share its data with researchers and fund their work, but questioned how the measurements might be made. \"I\u0027m not sure if you can measure health of a discourse,\" she told the BBC. \"If the shared topic of discourse is a terrible propaganda message that\u0027s not very healthy.\" \u0027Not proud\u0027\nHowever, Ms Neudert said it was a good move for Twitter. \"This is Twitter\u0027s way of saying \u0027we realise our platform has problems and we have to do things about it\u0027,\" she said. \"It\u0027s not just propaganda and meddling but there is also a hostile community on Twitter.\" Mr Dorsey admitted that the firm had found it difficult to manage the way its platform was used. \"We aren\u0027t proud of how people have taken advantage of our service, or our inability to address it fast enough,\" Mr Dorsey wrote on Twitter. In a series of tweets he said that the firm had focused on removing offensive content rather than trying to encourage \"more healthy debate\". Explaining Twitter\u0027s decision to seek a health check, he said: \"If you want to be able to improve something, you have to be able to measure it\". Twitter has seen a variety of high profile accounts closed, often by celebrities, because of persistent trolling. The Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones left in 2016 after a barrage of abuse following the release of the remake of the movie, which attracted criticism because of its all-female cast. She has since returned. The singer Ed Sheeran has been another example of someone famous abandoning Twitter.

And will sales continue to decline until they do? Samsung is casting a long shadow over this year\u0027s Mobile World Congress. The technology industry get-together in Barcelona is set to be dominated by the launch of its Galaxy S9 and S9+ handsets. The reaction from many rivals - including Huawei, HTC and LG - appears to have been to hold off their own flagship launches until later in the year. Based on \"leaks\", the S9 looks to be another rectangular, rigid product with an almost-all glass front and sleek metal back. Samsung\u0027s own teaser campaign has centred on its camera\u0027s capabilities rather than a radical form. Of the few other new phones expected, speculation has focused on how many lenses they will feature, where their fingerprint sensors will be placed, their display dimensions and whether they will retain a headphone jack, rather than any expectation of a major leap forward. Asus Zenfone 5 Lite - quad cam (2 x 20MP selfie + 2 x 16MP rear) FHD+ pic.twitter.com/819mlsLJm7 End of Twitter post by @evleaks \"The tragedy is that we had two decades of incredible innovation with flip-phones, candy-bar phones, sliders, round phones, square phones - all kinds of different things,\" said Ben Wood, from the consultancy CCS Insight. \"But the world changed in 2007 when Steve Jobs pulled the iPhone out of his pocket, and had what became the dominant design. \"We\u0027ve since gravitated to the black rectangle with a touchscreen as the form factor of choice, and it feels like we\u0027ve now reached a technology plateau where firms compete by offering marginal changes around the edges.\" Even so, there does appear to be an appetite for something \"a bit different\". The big story from last year\u0027s MWC was the Nokia 3310. The \"reimagined\" version of the Finnish company\u0027s classic handset had both physical number keys and a screen that bulged at its bottom. Its manufacturer, HMD Global, struggled to meet demand when it went on sale, despite several critical reviews. More revolutionary still, Lenovo has previously shown off a foldable phone concept that wrapped around the wrist. And Samsung has exhibited a prototype with a roll-out display. Both prompted lots of online chatter but have yet to be turned into commercial products. But change for change\u0027s sake can be a mistake. Two generations of LG\u0027s curved-screened Flex smartphones left many consumers confused as to what benefit the design had. And the South Korean company quickly retreated from the G5\u0027s ability to pop off its bottom to allow bolt-on hardware modules to be added, after sales disappointed. Pixel planner\nIt\u0027s somewhat telling about the current state of smartphone design that when the creative lead of Google\u0027s Pixel 2 discussed his work with the BBC, much of the conversation was dedicated to its colour schemes. \"On the panda one [there\u0027s a] very bold, very expressive black-and-white colourway, with... a spark of optimistic colour in the orange power button,\" Alberto Villarreal said. The Mexico-born designer said he had been excited by recent trends in the fashion industry, and in particular the way people were combining formal items with athletics wear. \"The mix-and-match of those neutral tones, with some sparks of colour that make it more sporty, are things we definitely looked at for inspiration,\" he said. When it came to the rest of the design, Mr Villarreal says he took a less-is-more approach. \"One thing that we been very careful about is making sure that when you look at the phone from the front, the attention of the user is focused on the screen. \"So [it was about] removing anything that is distracting from that. \"We have no branding, no buttons. And even details like the front-facing stereo speakers [is] something that we are treating very discreetly, blending with the black front. \"Even the bezels of the phone are black.\" Mr Villarreal declined to discuss how flexible components and other innovations might affect future designs. But he did say the public should be sceptical when they read reports about technology companies making last-minute hardware changes. \"We were were working on the [Pixel 2] before we had released the previous one,\" he said. \"In order to manufacture a product in high-volume, you have to start the pre-production quite a few months before. \"So, I cannot think of major changes that could happen to a product very close to the launch date.\" Handset-makers may currently be more occupied dreaming up new artificial intelligence features and augmented reality capabilities than trying to rethink how mobiles look in the hand. But recent shipment figures indicate many consumers don\u0027t see these features as compelling reasons to upgrade. IDC recently reported the global market was down 6.3% over the October-to-December quarter in 2017 compared with the same three months the previous year, while Strategy Analytics put the fall at 8.8%. China - the world\u0027s biggest market - represented a particular black spot. Local demand for smartphones suffered a 14% year-on-year plunge, according to Canalys. While absorbing those figures, it\u0027s worth noting that the data would have been even worse had Apple not released the iPhone X - a device that at least looked different to its predecessors, even if it too conformed to the current minimalistic aesthetic trend. \"Hardware is always the easiest thing to sell - if it looks different you get consumers attention, and then you build from there,\" said Carolina Milanesi, a consumer technology analyst at Creative Strategies. \"Trying to get someone into a store for something that looks the same as last year is difficult, even if it has new things to offer.\" She added that shop workers often struggled to explain new artificial intelligence and cloud-based facilities, while many consumers had proved suspicious of the privacy implications. Return of the flip\nThat\u0027s not to say there aren\u0027t some companies attempting something out of the ordinary. UK-based Bullit Group - which previously designed a Kodak-branded phone whose rear resembled a compact camera - has a new rugged CAT phone with a smell sensor, and is also promising to unveil a Land Rover-inspired handset at this year\u0027s MWC. Movie camera-maker Red is developing the Hydrogen One for later in the year. The phone promises a new type of \"holographic display\" and is intended to have a variety of camera-based modules attached to its back. And Samsung itself recently launched a modern take on the flip-phone, in China - the W2018 - with screens on both its inside and outside as well as a physical dial-pad. It is, however, expected to cost upwards of $3,000 (£2,140) - an idiosyncratic look, it seems, can merit an extraordinary price.

Currently only the original yellow skin tone is available for the 34 emojis for relationships and families. \"We want our kids to have emojis that look like their parents,\" Alexis is reported to have said. \"[Emoji] are the universal language of the internet and should reflect the modern world where interracial relationships are normal.\" The Unicode Consortium is a non-profit body which reviews and develops emoji standards - including making things more inclusive. There\u0027s a specific request that three skin tones - light, medium, and dark skin tones - be added to each face in the couple with heart and kissing emoji. This is despite the emoji keyboard now having six skin tones to choose from on emojis which show an individual\u0027s face. Unicode then has to vote on the proposal in a process that can take up to two years before it\u0027s rolled out on different platforms. In a statement Tinder said: \"As the largest and most diverse platform for meeting new people, we are uniquely positioned and incredibly proud to petition for this update. \"Inclusivity is a core value at Tinder, and we believe in fighting for what our users believe in.\" Recent petitions to expand the emoji catalogue have resulted in water pistols replacing guns, adding same sex couples to the emoji keyboard as well as more recently a redhead emoji. As it stands, the emoji keyboard already shows a range of family set-ups - including single parent families and same-sex parent families. Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

{"hash":"df2998b5dd7c1937191ff192d5397993","title":"Obituary: Trevor Baylis","author":"bbc","feed":"tech","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-28316975","content":"Trevor Baylis believed that the key to success was to think unconventional thoughts. It was this mindset that saw him develop his clockwork radio after hearing about the problems of educating African people about HIV and Aids. It enabled those in remote areas without electricity, or access to batteries, to get the information that could save their lives. But despite the success of this, and other inventions, Baylis never made a great deal of money from his many ideas. Trevor Graham Baylis was born in Kilburn, north-west London, on 13 May 1937 and brought up in Southall, Middlesex. His father was an engineer and the young Trevor was introduced to a Meccano building set which inspired his fascination with mechanical things. The young Baylis supplemented the family income by working on a local milk round which saw him getting up at 3am each morning. He was also a proficient swimmer and narrowly failed to qualify for the 1956 British Olympic team, something he greatly regretted. He left school at 15 to work in a local soil mechanics laboratory, attending day-release courses in mechanical and structural engineering. Baylis did his National Service as a physical training instructor in the Army. When he left, he got a job as a salesman with Purley Pools, one of the first companies to sell free-standing swimming pools. Recycled\nBecause he was a good swimmer he demonstrated the pools at shows, attracting crowds of potential customers. He went on to form an aquatic stunt troupe which saw him diving into a glass-sided tank and also performing an underwater act in a Berlin circus. \"It was fantastic,\" he later recalled. \"I made enough money to buy a plot of land and and build the house of my dreams The death of a close friend in a trapeze accident prompted him to begin developing products for people with disabilities. \"Her death broke my heart,\" he said. \"You realise disability is only a banana skin away.\" He developed a range of products under the Orange Aids label, including one-handed scissors and devices for opening bottles and cans. But although the products were successful they failed to make his fortune. The costs of getting a patent were prohibitive and companies were able to copy his inventions. Aids\n\"I went into the deal which I thought would secure the future of Orange Aids with culpable impetuosity. I had been used to doing business on a handshake and my word of honour, and I made the error of actually believing what the men in the pinstriped suits told me.\" It was to be something that dogged his career but he remained philosophical, saying he always followed his heart. \"It\u0027s not about the money,\" he said in a 2004 interview. \"I can\u0027t imagine anything worse than looking at a computer all day then glancing at your watch because there is an important meeting about the men\u0027s toilets at 3pm.\" The idea for his wind-up radio came while he was watching a TV programme in 1991 about the spread of Aids in Africa and a proposal to tackle it by broadcasting educational programmes on the radio. Baylis later said he went into a reverie imagining himself as a colonial settler, nursing a gin and tonic and listening to a wind-up gramophone. The image encouraged him to go to his workshop, which was filled with disassembled domestic appliances and, within half an hour, he had a working prototype of his clockwork radio. Learning from his Orange Aids experience, Baylis patented the project and went in search of a manufacturer. Everyone he approached turned him down. Failed\nIt was an appearance on the BBC\u0027s Tomorrow\u0027s World programme in 1994 that finally brought his invention to public attention. \"Everyone thought I was a genius whereas, up to then, I was just another silly little man.\" Further publicity followed. He was awarded the BBC Design Award for Best Product and Best Design in 1996 and met Nelson Mandela and the Queen. A South African company began manufacturing his radio in 1997 but, once again, Baylis failed to make a great deal of money from the product. \"My mistake was that I trusted the people I was working alongside. Large corporations can circumnavigate your patents.\" He eventually lost control of his design and the company, somewhat ironically, began making cheaper wind-up radios for a Western market increasingly concerned with green issues. Undaunted, Baylis continued coming up with new ideas including a shoe that could generate electricity as the wearer walked. Disarray\nHe demonstrated them with a 100-mile hike across Namibia to raise money for a landmine charity. He also set up the Trevor Baylis Foundation to encourage and develop new products and, importantly, advise inventors how to protect their intellectual property. He was awarded an OBE in 1997 and collected a number of honorary degrees from leading universities. Trevor Baylis never married, believing that no wife would put up with the disarray in which he liked to work. He strongly believed that Britain was cavalier in its treatment of inventors, meaning many products disappeared overseas. \"Inventors do not get enough credit,\" he said. \"I always say, art is pleasure, invention is treasure. \"Nobody seems to know who invented the paper clip but everybody has one.\" ","date":1520341619000,"topics":[]}

The price to get automated \"bot\" accounts to make a hashtag trend for a few hours is around £150 ($200). It was an odd topic for people to suddenly be talking about. In early December a phrase which roughly translates as \"Grilled Lamb Delivery\" was a top trending phrase on Twitter in Saudi Arabia. Nearly 17,000 tweets mentioned the phrase - most of them promoting just one restaurant, and listing its phone number. As it turned out, thousands of \"people\" weren\u0027t in fact talking about one establishment\u0027s meat products, as succulent, juicy or overcooked as they might have been. In fact, the \"Grilled Lamb Delivery\" hashtag was a clandestine advertising campaign being pushed - successfully - by a network of automated bot accounts. The lamb trend is one of many artificially manufactured hashtags which regularly hit Twitter\u0027s list of \"Trending Topics\" in Saudi Arabia. They\u0027re promoted by shadowy companies that make money by gaming the social network\u0027s algorithm in an attempt to make conversations seem organic and natural - when they are anything but. You might also be interested in\n\"Trending Topics\"\nAt its most basic, Twitter\u0027s \"Trending Topics\" list is a real-time gauge of what people are talking about on the network. If you\u0027re looking at Twitter on a desktop, the list usually runs in a prominent position along the side of the page (circled below in red): On the Twitter mobile phone app, the list is one of the first things you see if you touch the magnifying glass icon. There\u0027s a worldwide list of Trending Topics, but also separate local lists detailing what\u0027s going big in individual countries and cities. Users can easily change their settings and look at lists from around the world. What goes on the Trending Topics lists is governed by an algorithm that measures not only sheer popularity (i.e. the total number of tweets), but velocity - in other words, how fast certain topics are surging on the network. It\u0027s why, for instance, names associated with breaking news and popular news site headlines often crack the list very quickly. Companies can pay Twitter to appear on the list. But these \"Promoted Trends\" are clearly marked as advertising. That\u0027s not the case for the artificially trending hashtags BBC Trending found. Congratulations Fahima!\nOur investigation discovered that companies in Saudi Arabia are promising to make hashtags hit the Trending Topics list for relatively small sums - and in many cases they are succeeding. To boost the popularity of otherwise mundane phrases and hashtags, these companies are using networks of bots - automated accounts which are programmed to shoot out a stream of messages at a particular time. Trending approached several companies which claimed to be able to make hashtags trend. Eventually we managed to contact the company behind the \"Grilled Lamb\" hashtag campaign. After a series of negotiations via WhatsApp, we were charged $200 (just under £150) to get the Arabic equivalent of \"Congratulations Fahima\" onto Saudi Arabia\u0027s Trending Topics list. The person behind the company promised that he could get the hashtag trending throughout the Gulf country. One attempt was aborted when the company representative said that high Twitter traffic due to a celebrity wedding meant he could not make the hashtag trend on our first chosen date. He was more successful several days later. The hashtag hit the list of top trends in the Saudi city of Jeddah, reaching as high as the sixth slot on the list. The botnet used by the company pumped out more than 600 messages including the \"Congratulations Fahima\" hashtag. But once it hit the list of Twitter Trends, real people began to use it. Some asked who Fahima was or claimed to be her friend. \"I know Fahima!\" tweeted one. \"She just had quadruplets!\" Bot limitations\nThere were definite limitations to the power of the company\u0027s botnet. The hashtag did not make it onto the general list of trends in Saudi Arabia - although other hashtags, like the \"Grilled Lamb\" one, did trend nationwide. And claims by the company and other similar firms that they could get hashtags trending in the UK and other Western countries appear to be highly exaggerated. But the ability to force something onto the trending list is impressive in a country where Twitter is hugely popular. According to a survey in 2014, Saudi Arabia had 2.4 million Twitter users - more than 40% of all active users of the social network in the Arab region. Trending tried to call the number associated with the WhatsApp account which handled the transaction, but the man who answered denied knowing anything about the company\u0027s business. Political potential\nHashtags which appear to be advertising in disguise regularly trend in Saudi Arabia. And although the most obvious ones are commercial in nature, there is potential for political manipulation as well, according to Marc Owen Jones, a lecturer of the history of the gulf and the Arabian Peninsula at Exeter University. \"I realised in the last Saudi-Qatar crisis that thousands of accounts were producing information that are either fake or propaganda,\" he says. \"What\u0027s interesting is having lots of these accounts is that they can manipulate what\u0027s seen by many audiences in the world, so the more accounts you have picking on a certain topic the more the topic gets pushed up to trend.\" \"Having those bots makes people believe that this is what people in the Gulf are talking about,\" he said.

{"hash":"dfd78a1478d2018b0ed02190f577fa88","title":"Wot, no signal?","author":"bbc","feed":"tech","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43090226","content":"Large chunks of the planet are still of out of reach of mobile phone signals - billions are still without access to digital communications. But this could change thanks to shrinking satellite sizes and costs. Lower-cost, space-based mobile phone services will soon be a reality thanks to one firm\u0027s fleet of nano-satellites that will bounce your voice or text signal from one spacecraft to the next and finally down to the person you\u0027re calling. \"People were thinking of using nano-satellites for Earth imagery but nobody had thought of using them for voice or text communications,\" says Israeli former fighter pilot Meir Moalem, the chief executive of Sky and Space Global (SAS). \"We were the first.\" His firm is aiming to offer customers mobile phone connections via a constellation of 200 shoebox-sized satellites weighing just 10kg (22lb) each. The fleet is set to be operational by 2020 and will provide text, voice and data transfer services to the Earth\u0027s equatorial regions - including much of Latin America and Africa - to a market of up to three billion people. \"Affordable mobile services are critical for the economic and social development of many developing countries,\" says Mr Moalem, who believes SAS\u0027s nano-satellites will shake up the space-based communications market. \"Our total constellation costs just $150m (£108m). That\u0027s less than the cost of a single standard communications satellite. This is what we mean when we talk of a disruptive technology.\" But SAS is just one of a number of companies with big plans for space right now. Perhaps the most ambitious is Elon Musk\u0027s SpaceX, which is aiming to build a huge 4,400-satellite constellation offering global internet coverage. It will be using its own Falcon-9 rockets to launch its fleet and plans to have the network operating by 2024. And OneWeb has an 800-satellite constellation set for 2020, again focused on global broadband, while Google and Samsung are also mulling similar initiatives. With all these satellites, low-Earth orbit - an altitude of 2,000km (1,200 miles) or less above the planet - is becoming an increasingly crowded space. This could make future launches potentially difficult and dangerous with space debris. Then there is the issue of finance. Not every planned constellation is going to find the investors with deep enough pockets to back it, though David Fraser, research director at APP Securities, says SAS could be \"an attractive alternative option\" given its low capital costs. Vincent Chan, professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT, believes that satellite miniaturisation and cheaper launch vehicles mean that the \"nano-sat is ready to serve the public\". Such lower-cost infrastructure could bring much-needed mobile communications to the world\u0027s poorer regions, he says, helping to reduce the digital divide. But, he adds, SAS\u0027s focus on voice and text services rather than broadband internet, suggests that \"the digital divide will be narrower but not disappear\". For its part, SAS is using a non-traditional method of getting its satellites into orbit. They will be air-launched in batches of 24 by Virgin Orbit, part of Richard Branson\u0027s Virgin group. Virgin\u0027s modified Boeing 747-400 will fly up to 35,000ft (10,000m), then LauncherOne, a two-stage liquid oxygen-powered expendable rocket, will blast the payload into orbit. It\u0027s one of a number of air-launch-to-orbit systems under development. The advantage of launching from an aircraft is that the rocket can be launched in exactly the direction to suit the satellite\u0027s planned orbit. Virgin is planning its first launch later this year, while SAS\u0027s craft will be launched in 2019. Launch costs will typically be about $12m, much less than a traditional launch, says Virgin. It is \"all about helping the small satellite community get into orbit,\" says Dan Hart, Virgin Orbit\u0027s president and chief executive. Such lower-cost launch services will open up space to \"a whole host of communications [and] remote sensing applications,\" he says. SAS has already proved that its communications systems works with three pilot satellites, and is now signing deals with partners in Africa and Latin America - including one of the biggest satellite-communications providers in the Americas, Globalsat Group. Globalsat\u0027s chief executive, Alberto Palacios, says his firm\u0027s current customers - in the mining, energy, defence banking, and government sectors - can afford the costs of traditional satellite phone calls. But he believes nano-satellites are a game-changer. \"Some customers invest several hundreds of dollars in the hardware for a satellite phone terminal and will pay $50 a month for the service. But if you can offer a solution for half of that - then the price can be compared to conventional mobile phones,\" he explains. SAS says it is going for the gap in the market between existing satellite communications operators, such as Iridium, Inmarsat and Globalstar, and land-based mobile networks such as Vodafone, Telefonica, Airtel and Safaricom. It is targeting customers earning less than $8 a day. In Ghana, the company has just signed a five-year deal with telecoms provider Universal Cyberlinks to help government agricultural projects and public services, including monitoring cocoa production across 5,000 buying centres and checkpoints. \"When you travel outside of a city in Africa, often you lose your phone signal because it is not cost-effective to put up phone masts everywhere. That\u0027s where we come in,\" says Mr Moalem. \"In the West, we tend to forget that in many parts of the world people are not concerned about high-speed internet, they want to make simple phone calls, texting or money transfers. It\u0027s a basic need.\" Africa is certainly becoming a key market for mobile services. There were 420 million mobile subscribers in 2016 and by 2020 there will be more than 500 million, around half the population, says industry body GSMA. More Technology of Business\nFor his part, as you might expect of a former fighter pilot, Meir Moalem is optimistic about any rivals muscling in to the nano-sat communications niche. \"We welcome competition. It means we are a good business and there is money to be made,\" he says. \"There is room for other firms to do this, but we will have \u0027first mover\u0027 advantage.\" ","date":1519381699000,"topics":["Aerospace","Mobile phones"]}

{"hash":"69d23a79bed3356548dd0180311a0ebc","title":"Humble origins","author":"bbc","feed":"tech","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43060675","content":"Sweden is one of the most innovative countries in the world, yet has a business culture that discourages bragging about its success. So is this humility a help or a hindrance when it comes to start-ups? From household names such as Spotify and Skype, to gaming leaders King and Mojang and cashless payment companies iZettle and Klarna, Sweden is a hotspot for industry-changing new technologies. Despite just 10 million inhabitants occupying a land mass largely defined by forest wilderness, the Nordic nation has in recent years created more billion dollar companies per capita than anywhere else outside Silicon Valley. Last month, Sweden was top in Europe in Bloomberg\u0027s global innovation ranking. The more familiar narrative for Sweden\u0027s start-up success story typically touches on several factors. It has a strong digital infrastructure, a highly educated, tech-savvy workforce, and an ideal population size for testing new innovations. And for those whose ideas don\u0027t take flight, there is a strong social welfare net to set them back on their feet. But since the death of Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad - and obituaries highlighting his humility and frugality - these firmly-embedded cultural traits have recaptured attention. Local and global observers are questioning their continuing role in shaping Sweden\u0027s thriving economy - including its disruptive tech scene. \"Trying to keep boasting to a minimum and finding a consensus so that everybody is on the same page\" remain two of the most pervasive practices in the Swedish workplace, says Lola Akinmade Akerstrom, a former programmer and now a cultural commentator, who highlighted this in her recent book Lagom: The Swedish Secret of Living Well. While the language in other innovation hubs might focus on individual rockstar CEOs \"killing it\"; in Swedish businesses \"it\u0027s about everybody getting together, making sure their voices are heard equally, so that they can all reach an optimal solution together,\" she says. At least part of this consensus-based culture has its roots in what Swedes call \u0027Jantelagen\u0027 (the Law of Jante) which draws its modern name from a town called Jante depicted in a 1933 novel by Danish-Norwegian author Aksel Sandemose. This describes a centuries-old tradition that discourages extravagant displays of wealth or success and deconstructs hierarchies. In other words, nobody should consider themselves better than anyone else. \"In the workplace, Jantelagen creates a more collaborative, as opposed to a more competitive, environment because it\u0027s trying to remove all the stress points of competition or feeling like you\u0027re better than each other,\" explains Mrs Akerstrom. About 400 miles north of the Swedish capital, the concept is being discussed over strong cups of coffee on the minimalist wooden benches and soft bean bags inside House Be, a co-working space and membership club for outdoor-loving tech workers in the mountainous town of Are. Despite a population of just 5,000, Are has the highest proportion of young entrepreneurs in the country, according to the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise (Svenskt Naringsliv), with many people drawn by opportunities to spend time on the slopes or out hiking, while also building a business. The hub was co-founded by Spotify\u0027s former international growth manager, Ulrika Viklund, who argues that the most positive aspect of Jantelagen in the start-up scene is that it encourages people to \"help each other out more\". \"We usually don\u0027t have this big boss that sits in a corner office and take all the decisions,\" she explains. \"At Spotify it wouldn\u0027t have been possible to succeed without this working culture where all the competences in the company are utilised because everyone is allowed to be innovative and say what they believe is the right thing to do.\" Johan Formgren, a tech entrepreneur previously based in Berlin, adds that Sweden\u0027s penchant for flat structures and modesty also helps to create strong networks. \"In Stockholm I was part of a network called SUP46 that gave us a lot of access to the biggest, greatest Swedish tech companies. The founder of Skype was there maybe once a month, and was accessible and wanted to talk to all us young tech start-up people.\" Currently building his fifth business - a digital human resources tool - from Are\u0027s snowy mountains, Mr Formgren has already raised \"close to half a million dollars\" in investment for his latest venture. Yet it\u0027s worth noting that these are details he only discloses after 30 minutes of conversation. And it is this aspect of Jantelagen - avoiding bragging - that many argue is detrimental to Sweden\u0027s tech scene. \"It has made it more difficult to have role models,\" argues Ulrika Wiklund. \"The people that succeed, they don\u0027t dare to drive a luxury car, they don\u0027t dare to show when they have done something good. Maybe that has made it more difficult to inspire entrepreneurs.\" Swedish start-ups attracted €1.3bn ($1.6bn: £1.1bn) in 2017, according to figures from European venture capital database Dealroom.co - compared to €2.9bn in Germany and €7.1bn in the UK. While the statistics are impressive given Sweden\u0027s size, does Jantelagen hold back companies from aiming higher? \"Research suggests you receive capital depending how confident and boastful you are about your idea,\" says Sofia Wingren, chief executive of Hyper Island, a business school in Stockholm with a focus on equipping students for careers in the digital sector. She argues that Swedes have typically been too susceptible to \"working in the quiet\" to \"perfect\" products, before seeking funding or launching them on to the market. More Technology of Business\nWhile Hyper Island\u0027s current crop of millennial students is less bashful and more globally-minded than previous generations, a core part of the school\u0027s teaching is focussed on trying to address this issue. \"We have a lot of performances or stage presentations where we coach and guide students on how... to present themselves and how to be confident,\" Ms Wingren says. External factors will clearly also play a role in Sweden maintaining its reputation as a leading innovation hub. An acute housing crisis, taxes on stock options and strict migration regulations are fuelling national debates about the country\u0027s ability to attract the global skills needed to help companies in the small Nordic nation to realise their ideas. Meanwhile, observers point to the challenge of maintaining the emphasis on trust and consensus that characterises Swedish business practices, in the face of growing global competition from other innovation hubs and rapid digitalisation. \"The world is moving so fast that we may not have time to get everybody\u0027s opinion,\" argues Lola Akinmade Akerstrom. \"Sweden has to find the sweet spot. It\u0027s about taking the best parts of that consensus mindset and a culture steeped in organisation, and being open to creativity and flexibility and diverse points of views and ways of working.\" ","date":1518739782000,"topics":["Entrepreneurship","Sweden"]}

How do you know if farmed salmon have had enough to eat? Well, according to Lingalaks fish farms in Norway, which produce nearly three million salmon each year, the fish make less noise once the feeding frenzy is over. The firm knows this thanks to a new hydro-acoustic system it has installed at one of its farms. The system listens to the salmon sloshing loudly about as they feed in a cluster. When the fish have had enough, they swim off and the noise lessens. Lingalaks chief executive Erlend Haugarvoll hopes this knowledge will save his firm lots of money in reduced feed, as much of it currently gets wasted. \"I think it could improve [expenditure] by about 5%,\" he says. \"That could be between 7m-10m krone (£630,000-£900,000; $900,000-$1.3m) for our firm.\" The system, developed by tech firm CageEye, has taken years to develop, says chief executive Bendik Sovegjarto. \"It\u0027s not like a pellet detector,\" Mr Sovegjarto says, which observes the number of fish food pellets left in the water. \"When you don\u0027t see any pellets, you can\u0027t be certain if it\u0027s because the fish are full or that you\u0027re looking in the wrong place because of the water currents.\" Using audio data from the caged salmon is more accurate and could save Norwegian fish farms 1bn krone a year in un-gobbled feed, believes Mr Sovegjarto. The technology has been developed with the help of Ole Folkedal, at the Institute of Marine Research, in Bergen. He has monitored salmon feeding patterns and other data, such as water temperature and oxygen levels, and this is giving scientists and farmers new insights into the factors influencing how much the fish want to eat. \"You have huge variations in how much to feed every day,\" says Mr Folkedal. He adds that the data can be used to operate completely automated feeding systems, with humans simply overseeing the process. The rise of artificial intelligence technologies like these, which make decisions about when feeding should stop and start, is set to make big changes to the lucrative industry of salmon farming. There are other hi-tech approaches to automated fish monitoring, too. For example, one start-up, Aquabyte, recently raised $3.5m (£2.5m) for a system that makes better use of existing video surveillance data. Many modern fish farms already use video cameras to monitor the salmon in their cages, says Aquabyte founder and chief executive Bryton Shang. \"They stick CCTV in the pens and have operators off site watching the fish and determining how much to feed,\" he explains. \"We take the images from the CCTV and use computer vision algorithms [instead].\" With this approach, computers carefully monitor the group of feeding fish visually. The system is also designed to look out for a perennially problematic visitor to fish farms - the parasitic sea louse. Lice attach to salmon and eat them, causing damage that can be fatal. The lice can also make the fish inedible for humans. Mr Shang hopes his technology will help farmers detect sea lice so that they can then be removed manually. But even lice removal could be automated in the future. Stingray has come up with a self-guided tool that fires lasers at the lice to destroy them. \"The louse is hit with a fatal result, and coagulates within milliseconds,\" boasts the company\u0027s website. Meanwhile the de-loused salmon, thanks to its mirror-like skin that reflects the laser, swims off unharmed. It\u0027s perhaps no surprise that salmon farmers are turning to hi-tech solutions - the industry is certainly a wealthy one. Fish farms are worth nearly 50bn krone (£4.6bn; $6.4bn) to the Norwegian economy, and this year the country is expected to see growth of 9% in farmed salmon production. Norwegian fish company Salmar\u0027s gigantic offshore installation, Ocean Farm 1, is a 110m-wide (120 yards) cage capable of containing 1.5 million fish. London-based Hemang Rishi, co-founder of Observe Technologies, says his firm is developing technology that can visually monitor feeding in salmon cages. \"We are just deploying our first product on site for an extended period of time in Chile, where they have the second largest salmon market in the world after Norway,\" he says. And in Florida, a firm called Atlantic Sapphire is hoping to construct a giant salmon farm - on land. The concept involves water swirled mechanically in large tanks to give fish the illusion that they are still at sea. It\u0027s not hard to imagine highly automated fish farms of the future, in which humans have very little to do. More Technology of Business\n\"My prediction is that autonomous systems will do most of the jobs in future years,\" says Mr Folkedal. However, he notes that current regulations in Norway mean that, for now at least, farmed fish must be manually checked regularly for signs of illness and mortalities. But many of the tasks farmers must perform daily - such as counting and measuring fish - are tedious, and could be automated once machines become accurate enough, Mr Folkedal believes. \"That\u0027s something that the farmers really want,\" he says.

The US president said \"the statements coming out of South Korea and North Korea have been very positive\", but also said it might be a \"false hope\". South Korea earlier said the subject was raised when its officials met the North\u0027s leader, Kim Jong-un, on Monday. Seoul said Mr Kim was also open to US talks, and would pause weapons testing. In previous programmes to halt its nuclear ambitions, the North has failed to keep its promises. The leaders of North and South Korea have also agreed to meet at a summit next month, Seoul\u0027s envoy says. It will be the first such meeting for more than a decade and the first since Kim Jong-un took power in North Korea. Throughout February\u0027s Winter Olympics in South Korea, the two countries struck a friendly tone, sending athletes to compete in a joint team and holding talks. What did President Trump say?\nSpeaking to reporters at Washington\u0027s Oval Office, he said: \"We have come certainly a long way, at least rhetorically, with North Korea. \"The statements coming out of South Korea and North Korea have been very positive. That would be a great thing for the world.\" The US leader also praised Pyongyang for its decision to take part in the Pyeongchang Olympics. But he earlier posted a cautious tweet, warning about a \"false hope\". Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction! End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump Meanwhile, US Vice-President Mike Pence said: \"Whichever direction talks with North Korea go, we will be firm in our resolve. \"The United States and our allies remain committed to applying maximum pressure on the Kim regime to end their nuclear program. \"All options are on the table and our posture toward the regime will not change until we see credible, verifiable, and concrete steps toward denuclearisation.\" Lt Gen Robert Ashley, who heads the US Defense Intelligence Agency, said he did not share optimism voiced in America, adding that \"we\u0027ll see how this plays out\". The US has maintained that North Korean gestures of rapprochement would carry little weight without a commitment on nuclear weapons - particularly following last year\u0027s nuclear and missile tests carried out by the North. The South Korean delegation is expected to visit Washington later this week to brief US officials on their talks in the North. Meanwhile, China\u0027s foreign ministry said it hoped the Koreas could continue with efforts to advance reconciliation, Reuters news agency reported. What is North Korea reported to have said?\nA statement from the South Korea president\u0027s office issued earlier on Tuesday said: \"The North showed willingness on denuclearisation in the Korean Peninsula. If military threats to the North Korea decrease and regime safety is guaranteed, the North showed that it has no reason to retain nukes.\" The North\u0027s KCNA news agency said Mr Kim had \"warmly welcomed\" the delegates and held an \"openhearted talk\" with them. It said the dinner took place \"in a warm atmosphere overflowing with compatriotic feelings\". However, some critics have suspicions over North Korea\u0027s intentions. In the past, they have failed to follow through on deals, notably an aid-for-disarmament agreement in 2005. What happened at the Pyongyang dinner?\nSouth Korean officials had a four-hour dinner with Kim Jong-un on Monday. Among the delegation were intelligence chief Suh Hoon and National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong. Pictures showed Mr Kim and visitors from the South smiling broadly around a dinner table. Also present was Mr Kim\u0027s wife, Ri Sol-ju, who rarely appears at official events, and his sister Kim Yo-jong, who was part of a North Korean delegation to the Pyeongchang Olympics. The two sides appear to be aiming to capitalise on the reduced tensions after the Games, which saw the Koreas march together under one flag. During their visit, the South\u0027s officials also held a boardroom meeting and passed on a letter from South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in which he invited Mr Kim to attend further talks. KCNA said Mr Kim had \"exchanged views and made a satisfactory agreement\" on the letter and gave orders for it to be acted on.

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature assessed the status of 700 European beetles that live in old and hollowed wood. Almost a fifth (18%) are at risk of extinction due to the decline of ancient trees, the European Red List of Saproxylic Beetles report found. This puts them among the most threatened insect groups in Europe. Saproxylic beetles play a role in natural processes, such as decomposition and the recycling of nutrients. They also provide an important food source for birds and mammals and some are involved in pollination. \"Some beetle species require old trees that need hundreds of years to grow, so conservation efforts need to focus on long-term strategies to protect old trees across different landscapes in Europe, to ensure that the vital ecosystem services provided by these beetles continue,\" said Jane Smart, director of the IUCN Global Species Programme. Logging, tree loss and wood harvesting all contribute to the loss of habitat for the beetles, said the IUCN. Other major threats include urbanisation and tourism development, and an increase in wildfires in the Mediterranean region. Conservation efforts need to focus on long-term strategies to protect old trees and deadwood across forests, pastureland, orchards and urban areas, the report recommended. It said there should be inventories of ancient and veteran trees for each European country, to ensure these trees are protected in all landscapes. \"It is critical for the Common Agricultural Policy to promote the appropriate management of wood pasture habitats containing veteran trees across Europe,\" said Luc Bas, director of the IUCN European Regional Office. Monitoring\nThe report pointed to the need for different ages of trees in the landscape, including saplings, mature trees, ancient trees, standing dead trees, fallen tree trunks and stumps. It said some progress had been made in the forestry sector, while the importance of deadwood is being increasingly acknowledged in many countries. In Europe, there are 58 families of beetles, made up of nearly 29,000 species. About 4,000 are thought to rely on dead and decaying wood for at least part of their lifecycle. However, for many of these species data is lacking, suggesting more monitoring is urgently needed. \"The population trend of half the species assessed remains unknown,\" said Keith Alexander, IUCN Saproxylic Beetles Specialist Advisor. He said that three of the species from the list were found in the UK, including a type of longhorn beetle that lives only on veteran oak trees. He called for raised public awareness of their conservation needs. \"Some of these beetles are incredibly beautiful interesting things - if people stopped and looked at them and appreciated them, they\u0027d realise they\u0027re just as worthy of conservation as elephants and tigers,\" he told the BBC. \"And these things live in the countryside on our doorstep.\" Beetles at risk:\nFollow Helen on Twitter.

The chick lived 127 million years ago and belonged to a group of primitive birds that shared the planet with the dinosaurs. Fossils of birds from this time period are rare, with baby fossils seen as \"the rarest of the rare\". Scientists say the discovery gives a peek into the lives of the ancient, long-extinct birds that lived between 250 and 66 million years ago. The bird belonged to the enantiornithine family, most of which had teeth and clawed fingers on each wing, but otherwise looked much like modern birds. \"It\u0027s amazing to realise that many of the features we see among living birds had already been developed more than 100 million years ago,\" said Luis Chiappe, from the LA Museum of Natural History. Minute matter\nFrom nose to tail the hatchling was a bit shorter than the little finger of a human hand, and it weighed just 10 grams. The bird died not long after leaving the egg, giving a window into a critical stage of development. Researchers from the UK, Spain, Sweden and the US used state-of-the-art technology to study its fossilised bones. Analysis in a synchrotron - particle accelerators that use very intense light to study minute matter - revealed that the chick probably could not not fly at this stage. The cartilage in its sternum (breast bone in the centre of the chest) had not yet fully turned to bone. Lead researcher Fabien Knoll of ARAID-Dinopolis and the University of Manchester said analysis of bone development can be used to study a host of evolutionary characteristics. \"New technologies are offering palaeontologists unprecedented capacities to investigate fossils,\" he said. The fossil was found many years ago in the famous Las Hoyas site in Spain. However, it has remained largely unstudied until now. \"Truth be told, the techniques we used to analyse it in the paper (such as synchrotron microtomography and elemental mapping) had not yet been developed when the specimen was discovered,\" said Dr Knoll. Studying the process of bone development can explain a lot about a young bird\u0027s life and development. These early bird chicks may have been much like modern chickens, which have feathers and can move around from birth. Or they might have been more similar to living love birds, which hatch with no feathers and their eyes shut, meaning they need parental care. The research, published in the journal, Nature Communications, suggests the enantiornithines were very diverse in their behaviour and development. Follow Helen on Twitter.

Numbering more than 1.5 million birds, they were first noticed when great patches of their poo, or guano, showed up in pictures taken from space. The animals are crammed on to a rocky archipelago called the Danger Islands. The researchers, who detail the discovery in the journal Scientific Reports, say it is a total surprise. \"It\u0027s a classic case of finding something where no-one really looked! The Danger Islands are hard to reach, so people didn\u0027t really try that hard,\" team-member Dr Tom Hart from Oxford University, UK, told BBC News. The scientists used an algorithm to search images from the American Landsat spacecraft for sites of possible penguin activity. Landsat does not return especially high-resolution pictures and so when the system flagged potential colonies, they had to be followed up with much sharper pictures for confirmation. \"And the sheer size of what we were looking at took our breath away,\" said Dr Heather Lynch from Stony Brook University, New York. \"We thought, \u0027Wow! If what we\u0027re seeing is true, these are going to be some of the largest Adélie penguin colonies in the world, and it\u0027s going to be well worth our while sending in an expedition to count them properly.\" You may also be interested in:\nBut, as the name implies, the Danger Islands are notoriously difficult to reach. Even in the austral summer, the ocean surrounding the archipelago is filled with the kind of thick sea-ice that ships try to avoid. However, in December 2015, the team did manage to get on the ground to begin its count. And one of the most effective techniques was to deploy drones, which flew above the birds to make large mosaics of their nesting sites. \"The drone lets you fly in a grid over the island, taking pictures once per second. You can then stitch them together into a huge collage that shows the entire landmass in 2D and 3D,\" explained Prof Hanumant Singh from Northeastern University. Once again, trained software was called upon to do the actual counting. The survey revealed that the Danger Islands host in total 751,527 pairs of Adélie penguins, including the third and fourth largest colonies in the world. The result is of major significance because it would appear the archipelago has somehow avoided the recent Adélie declines documented elsewhere on the peninsula, particularly on its western side. Scientists suspect that decline has something to do with reductions in sea-ice, which is an important habitat for krill, the small crustaceans that form a key part of the penguin diet. Dr Hart commented: \"On the West Antarctic Peninsula, Adelie and chinstrap penguins are declining pretty fast, while Gentoo penguins are increasing. \"It\u0027s hard to know the causes. Clearly climate change and reduction in ice and krill play a part, but a decline in sea-ice also allows in shipping - fisheries in particular - which may exacerbate the problem. \"In the past we\u0027ve looked at this on the West Antarctic Peninsula versus places like Elephant Island (further to the north). Finally getting into the Danger Islands and counting the penguins shows how robust populations are where the ice is intact.\" And Dr Lynch added: \"The other point worth making is that these islands are right in the mix for a couple of marine protected areas that are being proposed. \"Whether they\u0027ll be in or out, we don\u0027t know but at least now the people making those decisions will understand how important this area is,\" she told BBC News. Dr Peter Fretwell from the British Antarctic Survey knows the team but was not involved in this study. He also uses satellites to identify and count animal groups. \"Despite our modern technologically advanced world there are still remote corners that we know very little about - usually because they are extremely difficult to get to,\" he said. \"Modern satellites are fantastic tools for exploring and studying these hard-to-access places. I am sure that there are many other natural discoveries to be made using these \u0027eyes in the sky\u0027.\" Follow Jonathan and Vic on Twitter ","date":1519985032000,"topics":["Penguins","Antarctic","Drones"]}

Berta Caceres was shot dead inside her home exactly two years ago, on the night of 2 March 2016. She had led protests against a dam project. The arrested man, Roberto David Castillo, is executive president of Desa, the firm that was building the dam. Desa has insisted he is innocent. The company blamed \"international pressure and smear campaigns of various NGOs [non-governmental organisations]\" for the development. Mr Castillo is reportedly a former military intelligence officer. Eight other people have already been tried over the killing, including members of the armed forces and other Desa staff. Ms Caceres\u0027 family have long maintained she was murdered for economic reasons. They say she suffered months of threats from police, politicians and construction companies. In November 2017, a 92-page report by international experts concluded that energy company executives and state agents had conspired to kill the activist. The murder raised outrage internationally, with Oscar-winner Leonardo DiCaprio tweeting that Ms Caceres\u0027 work should be honoured. She is remembered for peacefully defending the rights of Honduran indigenous communities and in 2015 won the Goldman Prize, one of the most prestigious awards for environmentalism. The judges said she had \"rallied the indigenous Lenca people of Honduras and waged a grassroots campaign that successfully pressured the world\u0027s largest dam builder to pull out of the Agua Zarca Dam\". The dam would have flooded large areas of land and cut off the supply of water, food and medicine for hundreds of Lenca people. News of Mr Castillo\u0027s arrest broke amid protests demanding justice for Ms Caceres, who was a mother of four. She is one of over 100 land activists murdered in Honduras in the last decade.

Waste consultancy Eunomia estimates official figures over-state the quantity of plastic packaging sent for recycling by about a third. Much of what does go into the waste stream may be of such poor quality it cannot be re-used, its report said. An industry spokesman said he was \"very confident\" of the accuracy of the data from packaging firms. But Eunomia argues that the industry\u0027s figures simply do not tally with the amount of plastic actually in the waste stream. And it says packaging firms contribute a small fraction of the £2.8bn burden on local authorities of dealing with waste. So who does the calculations? And who is making sure that companies get it right? Well, packaging firms have to take part in government-approved schemes under what is known as \"producer responsibility\". This obliges them to purchase a credit - a Packaging Recovery Note (PRN) - from a recycling firm to contribute to improving recycling. Defra says the scheme raised £50m in 2016. The cash was to be used for \"capacity building\" in the recycling system through increasing collection and processing of recyclables. But critics say the scheme is so opaque it is hard to tell exactly how the money is spent. Local councils, which have to run waste collection and litter services, complain they do not see a penny of it. The row goes to the heart of the government\u0027s current review of plastics and waste. Green campaigners want ministers to adopt the sort of deposit and return schemes on drinks containers that are seen across northern Europe. This system is transparent because every container going on to the market has to be registered for the deposit. So the tally of recycled bottles and cans is based on real numbers, not estimates. The packaging industry is urging ministers to stick with the current PRN scheme, which it says is cheaper. It is offering to make the system more transparent and to increase the amount raised for improving recycling. The Environment Secretary Michael Gove is expected to make a decision on the issue after Easter. Official statistics say that in 2016 the UK produced 2.26 million tonnes of plastic packaging waste, and recycled almost 44.9% of it. But Eunomia\u0027s Dominic Hogg countered: \"No-one believes these figures.\" He said when packaging was placed on the market it is clean, dry and free from extra materials such as labels. But when the quantity of plastic collected for recycling is measured, the weight is inflated by moisture, contaminants and labels. Another problem may be that volumes of plastic packaging placed on the market are based on estimates provided by the packaging industry itself. These firms, Eunomia claims, have little incentive to ensure accurate data because the more plastic they put on the market, the bigger their recycling bill through the PRN system. EU comparison\nThe PRN operation is run by a group of compliance firms. The main operator is Valpak. Its spokesman, Adrian Hawkes, told BBC News there was no evidence of producers deliberately under-reporting their plastic production. He said robust systems were in place to develop reasonable estimates of the total packaging placed on the market. \"We are confident in our information because it is based on very detailed and comprehensive data representing over 50% of UK packaged goods sales,\" he told BBC News. \"We use the UK\u0027s largest and most comprehensive database of packaging weights covering hundreds of thousands of different products to calculate the total tonnage of packaging put on the market.\" But he did concede the report raised challenges over packaging associated with on-line purchases across borders - and the fact that some smaller businesses do not currently have to make a report. He said their calculations were audited by the Environment Agency - and pointed out that providing false data is an offence. Dr Hogg maintained that the audit system was not tight enough, adding: \"The system of producer responsibility is failing. It has allowed problems with plastic packaging to grow.\" He said reform of the producer responsibility system must form part of a more radical overhaul of waste policy. And added that the PRN scheme was run at the lowest cost for business - not the lowest cost for society, because taxpayers have to foot the bill for collecting and disposing of waste. \"There should be a deposit refund scheme for beverage containers,\" he said. \"And producers of other packaging should be charged fees that really reflect how much recycled material it contains, and how well it is recycled.\" Local councils support a change in the system. The Local Government Association\u0027s spokesman, Cllr Martin Tett, told BBC News: \"Councils support reforms that see producers take greater responsibility around the creation and disposal of waste - including making a contribution towards local authority costs. \"The UK raises the lowest level of contribution to costs from producers amongst all EU states.\" \u0027Kerbside success\u0027\nValpak told BBC News: \"The producer responsibility system was deliberately designed by government and industry to meet required recycling targets at minimum cost. It was not intended to cover all the costs (of recycling).\" A spokesman said it estimated that producers contributed £100m a year towards recycling - that\u0027s between 25% and 30% of what they estimate is the total recycling bill. He said that Valpak had recently calculated that the situation is not so bad as it is portrayed. The current collection rate for plastic drinks containers in the UK is actually 74% - not the 57%, he said - thanks to kerbside collection systems. He added that government was considering changes to the PRN system which could involve an increased cost share by producers to fund specific activities. Samantha Harding from the Campaign to Protect Rural England told BBC News that packagers were \"dangling the carrot\" of more cash from an improved PRN system in order to avoid a deposit-return system. \"At the moment, 90% of costs fall on the taxpayer and this isn\u0027t right,\" she said.

They did it with the aid of a small radio telescope in the Australian outback that was tuned to detect the earliest ever evidence for hydrogen. This hydrogen was in a state that could only be explained if it had been touched by the intense light of stars. The team puts the time of this interaction at a mere 180 million years after the Big Bang. Given that the cosmos is roughly 13.8 billion years old, it means the first stars lit up a full nine billion years before even our own Sun flickered into life. Dr Judd Bowman of Arizona State University, US, is the lead author on the scholarly paper describing the observation in the journal Nature. He told BBC News that the discovery\u0027s great significance meant his group had to be absolutely sure no mistakes were made. \"We first started seeing signs in our data back in late 2015. And we\u0027ve really spent the last couple of years trying to think of all sorts of possible alternative explanations, and then rule them out one by one,\" he said. \"This is the first time any team has been able to present evidence for the detection of this signal and hopefully it will go down as a milestone for this type of astrophysical observation.\" For decades, scientists have sought evidence for the very first population of stars. Theory says they would have grown out of the cold hydrogen gas that filled the Universe following the Big Bang. They were very probably unwieldy giants that burned brilliant but brief lives, before then exploding and seeding the Universe with all the chemical elements that make life possible. We cannot see these ancient behemoths directly with current technology, but we can, say astronomers, capture an indirect proof of their activity. Their ultraviolet light should have altered the great clouds of hydrogen surrounding them, exciting the gas into a state that made it absorb background radiation at a very specific radio frequency of 1.4 gigahertz. The challenge for the table top-sized telescope at the Murchison observatory in Western Australia was to try to pick out this signal in the sea of radio noise coming from the sky. Part of the issue was knowing where exactly to search on the spectrum, given that the expansion of the Universe over the eons would have stretched the signal to much lower frequencies. But the team eventually found it in the region of 78 megahertz. And knowing what we do about the rate of cosmic expansion, the shift in frequency gives an origin for the starlight-hydrogen interaction of 180 million years after the Big Bang. \u0027New window\u0027\nOf significant interest is the strength of the signal which is well above expectation. This suggests, say commentators, that the hydrogen gas was a lot colder than previously supposed. One exciting explanation for this is if the hydrogen atoms in the early cosmos had some direct interaction with so-called \"dark matter\". This unseen \"stuff\" is postulated to exist because of the way its gravitational influence is seen to affect the rotation of galaxies. But its substance is unknown because no other type of interaction has yet been observed. The Murchison observation may be the first hint that such interactions are possible and the news therefore is likely to galvanise efforts to make the first detections of dark matter particles. Paolo de Bernardis is a professor of astrophysics at the University of Rome \"La Sapienza\", and was not connected with the research. He said the signal was extremely interesting. \"If confirmed, it\u0027s a breakthrough,\" he told BBC News. Quite why the signal was so strong, we would have to indulge our fantasies until follow-up experiments could probe it further, he added. \"But I find this measurement really exciting.\" Prof Brian Schmidt, who won the Nobel Prize for detecting an acceleration in the expansion of the Universe, described the discovery as potentially \"revolutionary\". And Prof Karl Glazebrook from Swinburne University of Technology, Australia, said astronomers worldwide would now be holding their breath until the result was confirmed by an independent experiment. \"If it is, then this will open the door to a new window on the early Universe and potentially a new understanding of the nature of dark matter,\" he explained.

The team, led by the British Antarctic Survey, was thwarted in its attempts to reach the massive block known as A-68 by thick sea-ice in the Weddell Sea. The iceberg broke away from the Larsen C Ice Shelf on the eastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula last July. It revealed portions of the sea-floor that had been covered for many thousands of years. The team, which is on the Royal Research Ship James Clark Ross, had been hoping to sample what were likely to be new species. These animals would have had to adapt to an environment devoid of light to survive. \"We knew that getting through the sea-ice to reach Larsen C would be difficult,\" said expedition leader Dr Katrin Linse. \"Naturally, we are disappointed not to get there but safety must come first. \"The captain and crew have been fantastic and pulled out all the stops to get us to the ice shelf, but our progress became too slow, with just 8km travelled in 24 hours and we still had over 400km to travel. Mother Nature has not been kind to us on our mission. \"But we have a \u0027Plan B\u0027; we will head north to areas which have never been sampled for benthic biodiversity. \"The Prince Gustav Channel Ice Shelf and neighbouring Larsen A Ice Shelf collapsed in 1995. We\u0027ll be sampling deeper than we planned at Larsen C - down to 1,000m - so we\u0027re excited about what deep sea creatures we might find.\" The expedition has gone later in the Antarctic season than it would have been ideal, but the urgent proposal to go sample A-68\u0027s waters had to fit with BAS schedules that had long been agreed for this season. Normally, it takes a few years to put such a venture together. There should, however, still be an opportunity to visit the berg next year as many on the current expedition will join a German effort run out of the Alfred Wegener Institute. It will use the Research Vessel Polarstern. In the meantime, the BAS Plan B goes into action. It will see the team collect seafloor animals, microbes, plankton, sediments and water samples in the vicinity of the alternative ice shelves.

The critcism comes from Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who said some firms had paid no tax and hidden their earnings offshore. And he promised to back the regulator Ofwat in tightening up rules to protect bill-payers and the environment. The industry body Water UK responded that the companies were dealing firmly with issues that threatened trust. But Mr Gove’s speech to a water industry conference must have made uncomfortable listening. He complained that water firms had paid out almost all of their £18bn profits to shareholders, instead of re-investing it in mending leaks and protecting the environment. And he named names: The boss of United Utilities taking home £2.8m a year; the head of Severn Trent, £2.4m. The secretary of state said last year Anglian and Southern paid zero corporation tax, whilst Thames has paid no corporation tax for a decade. He suggested: \"Some of their best brains appear to be as intent on financial engineering as much as real engineering.\" Mr Gove promised to back recommendations from the regulator Ofwat due to be published in April – and said he would not hesitate to increase the pressure. He told the firms: \"You may be private companies, but you have a responsibility to the public who can’t take their custom elsewhere.\" The politician complained that three billion litres of water still leak out every day - and said the figure has barely improved in the past four years. He said there had been no investment in new nationally significant supply infrastructure, such as major reservoirs, since privatisation. Craig Bennett from Friends of the Earth welcomed the comments but said Mr Gove could do much more himself to improve management of water. \"Defra are not doing enough,\" he told BBC News. \"They are still allowing new houses on flood plains – and there is constant backsliding on the need to use water more efficiently.\" Dr Matt Prescott from the Environmental Rating Agency told BBC News: “The environmental problems with the industry are a signal of financial problems \"We need effective regulation – it’s clearly not happening at the moment. Politicians can’t just have an obsession with bills.\" Dr Prescott said that during the recent prosecution of Thames Water at Aylesbury Crown Court they found that the Environment Agency did not have direct access to independently sourced pollution monitoring data. Instead, they had to rely on to water companies to self-monitor pollution levels discharged from sewage works. \"We think these forms of self-regulation should stop,\" he said. Water UK Chief Executive Michael Roberts countered that companies were putting public interest first. \"Water is fundamental to all of our lives, and companies fully understand their clear responsibility to act in the public interest,\" he said. \"For me, that boils down to doing the right thing in the right way, and tackling issues where they arise, because we want to maintain the high levels of trust our customers have for us. \"We know that they trust us, because more than eight out of 10 of them say so in our private polling. \"We should not lose sight of that as we address some of the issues that critics have raised.

Diabetes - or uncontrolled blood sugar levels - is normally split into type 1 and type 2. But researchers in Sweden and Finland think the more complicated picture they have uncovered will usher in an era of personalised medicine for diabetes. Experts said the study was a herald of the future of diabetes care but changes to treatment would not be immediate. Diabetes affects about one in 11 adults worldwide and increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, blindness, kidney failure and limb amputation. Type 1 diabetes is a disease of the immune system, which affects around 10% of people with the condition in the UK. It errantly attacks the body\u0027s insulin factories (beta-cells) so there is not enough of the hormone to control blood sugar levels. Type 2 diabetes is largely seen as a disease of poor lifestyle as body fat can affect the way the insulin works. The study, by Lund University Diabetes Centre in Sweden and the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, looked at 14,775 patients including a detailed analysis of their blood. The results, published in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology, showed the patients could be separated into five distinct clusters. Prof Leif Groop, one of the researchers, told the BBC: \"This is extremely important, we\u0027re taking a real step towards precision medicine. \"In the ideal scenario, this is applied at diagnosis and we target treatment better.\" The three severe forms could be treated more aggressively than the two milder ones, he said. Cluster 2 patients would currently be classified as type 2 as they do not have an autoimmune disease. However, the study suggests their disease is probably caused by a defect in their beta-cells rather than being too fat. And perhaps their treatment should more closely mirror patients who are currently classed as type 1. Cluster 2 had a higher risk of blindness while cluster 3 had the greatest risk of kidney disease, so some clusters may benefit from enhanced screening. Better classification\nDr Victoria Salem, a consultant and clinical scientist at Imperial College London, said most specialists knew that type 1 and type 2 was \"not a terribly accurate classification system\". She told the BBC: \"This is definitely the future of how we think about diabetes as a disease.\" But she cautioned the study would not change practice today. The study was only on Scandinavians and the risk of diabetes varies considerably around the world, such as the increased risk in South Asians. Dr Salem said: \"There is still a massively unknown quantity - it may well be that worldwide there are 500 subgroups depending on genetic and local environment effects. \"Their analysis has five clusters, but that may grow.\" Sudhesh Kumar, a professor of medicine at Warwick Medical School, said: \"Clearly this is only the first step. \"We also need to know if treating these groups differently would produce better outcomes.\" Dr Emily Burns, from Diabetes UK, said understanding the diseases could help \"personalise treatments and potentially reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications in the future\". She added: \"This research takes a promising step toward breaking down type 2 diabetes in more detail, but we still need to know more about these subtypes before we can understand what this means for people living with the condition.\" Follow James on Twitter ","date":1519951587000,"topics":[]}

The region was one of the last on Earth to be permanently settled by humans who used canoes to traverse hundreds of miles of open ocean. Two different studies tracked changes over time in the genetic make-up of people inhabiting Vanuatu - regarded as a gateway to the rest of the Pacific. The work appears in Nature Ecology \u0026 Evolution and Current Biology. Prof David Reich, from Harvard Medical School, said the region had a \"tremendous\" range of human diversity, adding that Vanuatu itself had an \"extraordinary diversity of languages\" in a relatively small area. The number of languages in the tiny island state is thought to be more than 130, though several are endangered with just a few active speakers. Prof Reich, who is lead author of the study in Current Biology, added that Vanuatu was a \"gateway to the remote Pacific islands... through that region of Vanuatu and neighbouring islands, people spread all over the Pacific\". The first people to arrive in the islands belonged to the Lapita culture, who expanded out of Taiwan between 5,000 and 6,000 years ago, reaching Vanuatu about 3,000 years ago. \"They were really talented seafaring people,\" said Dr Cosimo Posth, from the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany. Dr Posth was co-author of the study in Nature Ecology \u0026 Evolution. Their secret was the specialised outrigger canoe, which is characterised by the addition of lateral support floats which stabilise the main hull. This innovation, says Dr Posth, \"allowed them to cover immense distances over the ocean\". The Lapita voyages represent the most extensive dispersal of agricultural people in history. They carried farming technology and languages belonging to the Austronesian family as far west as Madagascar and as far east as Rapa Nui (Easter Island). But modern people in the wider region have varying amounts of ancestry from \"Papuan\" populations like those that live today on New Guinea, and other islands in the Bismarck Archipelago such as the Solomons, New Britain and New Ireland. However, when exactly this ancestry spread across the region has been hotly debated. One idea was that the Lapita mixed with people speaking Papuan languages early in their voyages, spreading both types of ancestry throughout the region. Alternatively, it could be explained by more recent seafaring expansions by people from the Bismarck Archipelago. DNA from burials on Vanuatu dating from between 2,900 and 150 years ago show that the first Lapita people were genetically similar to present-day populations such as the Ami who live in Taiwan. \"The first people of these remote pacific islands had none of the Papuan ancestry from the New Guinea region that is ubiquitous today and everyone has about 25% of it,\" said Prof Reich. That means that ancestry from the south must have arrived in the region more recently. Indeed, by studying the DNA of the Vanuatu population through time, the researchers found that people bearing Papuan-like ancestry arrived in the islands around 2,600 years ago. An influx of - mostly male - newcomers steadily transformed the genetic make-up of the island. Intriguingly, all of this happened without a replacement in the language. The people of Vanuatu today speak Austronesian languages like those presumably spoken by the Lapita. This may be because a \"lingua franca\" developed in the region among seafaring, mobile people voyaging and trading across long distances. Other peoples of the Pacific, such as those living in Polynesia, derive their Papuan ancestry from a different source to the one that populated Vanuatu. \"What we\u0027re detecting is not one, but at least two movements of Papuan ancestry out into the Pacific,\" said Prof Reich. These other movements remain a focus for future studies. Dr Posth commented: \"All the islands in eastern Polynesia - from the Cook Islands to Hawaii, New Zealand, French Polynesia - were settled much later, about 1,500 years after the Lapita expansion. So there must have been further technological advancements [to the initial outrigger canoe design] that allowed people to spread even further east.\" ","date":1520023349000,"topics":["Vanuatu"]}

That target was set by the UN as a Sustainable Development Goal. However, the new maps, which give detail to the level of an individual village, show that almost every nation has at least one region where children\u0027s health is improving. They are published in Nature. The two studies have mapped child growth rates and educational attainment for women of reproductive age - tracking progress in both in 51 countries between 2000 and 2015. The scientists targeted these two factors in particular because they are important predictors of child mortality. \"Together, these are very useful indicators of where populations are doing well and where they\u0027re being left behind,\" explained Prof Simon Hay, a global health researcher from the University of Washington in the US. Prof Hay and his team pieced together data from community-level surveys and produced a series of 5km by 5km scale maps, showing child growth and educational attainment across Africa over the 15-year span of the study. \u0027Stark disparities\u0027\nThis revealed that most African countries, especially much of sub-Saharan Africa and eastern and southern regions, show improvement in malnutrition. They also showed large disparities within individual countries. But by mapping these in such detail, scientists say policymakers will have the evidence to direct their resources. Kofi Annan, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former secretary general of the UN, endorsed this aim in an article he wrote in response to the maps\u0027 publication. \"Without good data,\" he wrote, \"we\u0027re flying blind. If you can\u0027t see it, you can\u0027t solve it.\" While highlighting what he called \"stark disparities\" in progress, particularly in conflict-affected areas, Mr Annan said the progress in Africa that these maps painted was \"astonishing\". \"Especially for me,\" he said, \"an African accustomed to international headlines depicting a continent consumed by war, famine and hunger. The Africa shown in these maps tells a different story - one of measurable, steady progress on issues long thought intractable. \"[But] there are villages where all children are too short for their age. Across most of the Sahel, a semi-arid swath of land from the Atlantic to the Red Sea, high rates of stunting persist, with no hint of improvement. \"Such fine-grained insight brings tremendous responsibility to act.\" Lessons to learn\nProgress in Africa has never before been mapped in this level of detail and Prof Hay said that making the data openly available and providing \"the best information we can\" would help to direct resources towards the populations most in need. \"We can look at those communities that are doing particularly well and ask if there are lessons we can learn and apply elsewhere,\" he told BBC News. In a study that is considered to have been the birth of modern epidemiology in the 19th Century, the London physician John Snow mapped cholera cases in London - revealing in a world-changing map how cases in the city were clustered around one water pump in Broad Street. This led to the revelation that the disease was spread through contaminated water. Mr Annan concluded that these maps could be as powerful in the long battle against hunger. \"They are another tool in our arsenal,\" he said. \"Alone, they won\u0027t eradicate malnutrition but they will enable Africa\u0027s leaders to act strategically.\" ","date":1519876055000,"topics":["United Nations"]}

The use of neonicotinoids has been restricted in the European Union since 2013, following earlier risk assessments. Nations will discuss a European Commission proposal to extend the ban next month. Neonicotinoids are the world\u0027s most widely used insecticide. The new assessment considered more than 1,500 studies on the impacts of three neonicotinoids - clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam. \"There is variability in the conclusions, due to factors such as the bee species, the intended use of the pesticide and the route of exposure,\" said Jose Tarazona, head of the European Food Safety Authority\u0027s pesticides unit. \"Some low risks have been identified, but overall the risk to the three types of bees we have assessed is confirmed.\" Real-world situations\nThe EU banned the use of the three chemicals on flowering crops - seen as most attractive to bees - almost five years ago in a move then opposed by the UK. The Environment Secretary Michael Gove recently reversed the government\u0027s position and said it would back a ban on non-flowering crops too, including wheat and sugar beet. A Defra spokesperson said the government had fully applied restrictions on the use of neonicotinoids introduced by the EU to date and, following an assessment by UK scientists, announced last November that it was in favour of further restrictions. \"We always keep the evidence on neonicotinoids under review and will look in detail at today\u0027s report from the European Food Safety Authority,\" said the spokesperson. \"We make all decisions on pesticides based on the science and they are only approved once regulators are satisfied they meet safety standards for people and the environment.\" However, the National Farmers Union said further restrictions were not justified as the assessments failed to take into account \"real field situations, where evidence shows there are a number of factors affecting bees\". \"The reality is that there is a balance between environmental protection and food production that has to be considered and the impacts of a \u0027no neonicotinoid\u0027 scenario on pollinators also need to be fully assessed,\" said NFU Senior Regulatory Affairs Adviser, Dr Chris Hartfield. Bee health\nBayer, a major producer of the neonicotinoids imidacloprid and clothianidin, said the assessments did not justify further restrictions. \"Bayer fundamentally disagrees with EFSA\u0027s updated risk assessment conclusions for the active substances imidacloprid and clothianidin,\" the company said in a statement. \"EFSA\u0027s findings place it outside the current mainstream science on bee health, as represented by recent similar assessments done by agencies such as the US EPA and Canadian PMRA.\" Bees and other insects are vital for global food production as they pollinate most crops. The decline of pollinators in recent years has been blamed on disease, habitat loss and the widespread use of pesticides. Follow Helen on Twitter. ","date":1519853298000,"topics":[]}

The brightly-coloured flies may be picking up bee viruses as they forage at the same flowers. And scientists think hoverflies could then be spreading the deadly infections long distances when they migrate. Bees and other pollinators are vital to most of the world\u0027s food crops but have been in decline in recent decades due to the destruction of wild habitats, disease and pesticide use. It\u0027s not clear if hoverflies are harmed by the viruses or are simply carriers, but, either way, they could be moving them around the countryside and over long distances, say UK researchers. \"The hoverfly species that we detected the viruses in are known to migrate across Europe,\" said Emily Bailes of Royal Holloway University of London. \"They\u0027re moving a lot further than say a honey bee would and so you could be moving different types of the viruses into new places where the bees haven\u0027t been exposed to those before.\" Key driver\nInfectious diseases have been identified as a key driver of bee population declines. Scientists have a clear picture of parasites and viruses that can damage honey bees, but much less is known about what is happening in hoverflies and other pollinators. Hoverflies themselves are important pollinators of crops and wild flowers. They can be very mobile, and some migrate long distances every year. The research, carried out in collaboration with Oxford University, looked at four types of hoverflies collected at woodland in Oxfordshire. The samples were analysed in the lab for the presence of viruses. Three common bee diseases were found in two types of hoverflies that feed at the same flowers as bees. These cause symptoms like deformed wings which lead to rapid death or the bee being expelled from the hive. \"We don\u0027t really know what they\u0027re doing there yet, but because hoverflies are visiting the same flowers as bees, they could be spreading the virus around in quite a different way to the way that the bees are,\" said Dr Bailes. Ecosystem services\nKarl Wotton of the University of Exeter, who is not connected with the study, said there are about a dozen migratory hoverflies that move seasonally through Europe and in many other parts of the world. \"The numbers entering and leaving the UK each year are huge, in the billions, and all the while they provide ecosystem services including pollination and, for some species, biological control of crop pests,\" he said. They are almost certainly transferring pollen to create pollination networks that link across national borders, raising the question of whether they are doing the same with bee viruses. \"Perhaps,,\" he added, \"but it remains to be seen how the virus may affect the ability of hoverflies to undergo a strenuous long-distance migration or how long the virus may persist in their bodies given that no viral replication was detected.\" The research is published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters.

The illustrations are of a wild bull and a Barbary sheep on the upper-arm of a male mummy, and S-shaped motifs on the upper-arm and shoulder of a female. The discovery pushes back evidence for the practice in Africa by 1,000 years. Details of the tattoos have been published in the Journal of Archaeological Science. Daniel Antoine, one of the lead authors of the research paper and the British Museum\u0027s Curator of Physical Anthropology, said that the discovery had \"transformed\" our understanding of how people lived in this era. \"Only now are we gaining new insights into the lives of these remarkably preserved individuals. Incredibly, at over 5,000 years of age, they push back the evidence for tattooing in Africa by a millennium,\" he told BBC News. The male mummy was found about 100 years ago. Previous CT scans showed that he was between 18 and 21 years old when he died from a stab wound to the back. Dark smudges on his arm were thought to be unimportant until infrared scans revealed that they were tattoos of two slightly overlapping horned animals. One is interpreted to be a wild bull with a long tail and elaborate horns; the other appears to be a Barbary sheep with curving horns and a humped shoulder. The female mummy has four small S-shaped motifs running down her right shoulder. She also has a motif that is thought to represent batons used in ritual dance. The designs are under the skin and the pigment is probably soot. Previously, archaeologists had thought only women wore tattoos in the ancient past, but the discovery of tattoos on the male mummy now shows body modification concerned both sexes. The researchers believe that the tattoos would have denoted status, bravery and magical knowledge. The mummies were found in Gebelein in the southern part of Upper Egypt, around 40km south of modern-day Luxor. The individuals were buried in shallow graves without any special preparation, but their bodies were naturally preserved by the heat, salinity and aridity of the desert. Radiocarbon results indicate that they lived between 3351 and 3017 BC, shortly before the region was unified by the first pharaoh at around 3100 BC. The oldest example of tattooing is found on the Alpine mummy known as Ötzi who is thought to have lived between 3370 and 3100 BC. But his tattoos are vertical or horizontal lines, rather than figurative. Follow Pallab on Twitter ","date":1519876007000,"topics":["British Museum"]}

{"hash":"da876ff604ef256ab52910b68d179624","title":"Recycling gum","author":"bbc","feed":"science","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-43198104","content":"British designer Anna Bullus is on a mission to recycle chewing gum into useful objects, cleaning up our streets in the process. More than £14bn is spent on chewing gum around the world each year, but a lot of that gum will end up stuck to the ground. Gum is the second most common type of street litter after cigarette materials. In the UK, councils spend around £50m each year cleaning up the mess. But Anna had an idea. What if the sticky stuff could actually be recycled and turned into useful objects? Around 10 years ago, she began a project looking at kerbside litter. She examined random samples, looking at things like crisp packets and cigarette butts. She then tried to figure out which elements could be recycled. \"One of the litters I found was a piece of chewing gum and as a designer I was completely amazed there was nothing actually being done to recycle it,\" she said. Researching the chemistry of chewing gum, she discovered that its main ingredient, the gum base, is commonly a synthetic rubber, a type of polymer similar to plastic. Hear more\n\"It\u0027s called polyisobutylene,\" explains Anna, \"the same stuff you find in the inner tube of bicycle wheels.\" It is obtained from petrochemicals, which are refined from fossil fuels like crude oil. She realised that chewing gum, even once it has been finished with, is a versatile and potentially useful material. Collecting gum\nBut how do you persuade people to donate their gum - instead of carelessly tossing it on to the street? As part of her strategy, Anna created bright pink, bubble-shaped bins specially for disposing of gum called Gumdrop, which can be hung at head-height. These bins are themselves made of recycled chewing gum. A message next to the bins explains that any gum collected will be recycled into new objects. But would gum-chewers use them? The University of Winchester was one of the first places to sign up to use the bins. Around 8,000 people live and work on its campus and the authorities wanted to keep it clean of gum litter. It adopted a twin-pronged strategy to tackle the problem. It installed 11 of Anna\u0027s special bins and to reinforce the message that gum can be recycled if disposed of responsibly, it gave out hundreds of coffee cups made of recycled gum to first-year students. \"Students would give the cup a sniff to check it didn\u0027t smell of mint or bubble gum,\" recalls Liz Harris, the university\u0027s environmental officer. \"It\u0027s because so much of the chewing gum sold on the high street is a polymer [so it] can be used to make new products. \u0027When people get it, it\u0027s a really nice moment.\" Eighteen months later, the university noticed a drop in gum litter and is expanding the scheme. Heathrow Airport also ran a three-month trial which it said led to a \"noticeable improvement\" and saved it £6,000 in cleaning costs. Great Western Railway has installed the bins in more than 25 of its railway stations and is rolling out the scheme further. In each case, the bins did not suddenly solve the problem of gum litter, but they did seem to begin to change people\u0027s behaviour. Moulding gum\nAnother challenge for Anna was to find industrial partners willing to recycle old gum - something completely novel. She eventually persuaded a recycling plant in Worcester to get on board. It takes her bins and filters out unwanted material, like paper or sweet wrappers, before grinding it into pieces and then compounds this with other recycled plastic polymers. The proportion in the mixture varies, but Anna says each object she makes contains a minimum of 20% chewing gum. At a plastic moulding specialist in Leicester called Amber Valley, which normally makes alarm casings, Anna creates her designer objects. Here, the mixture containing the old chewing gum is put into an injection moulding machine. It is heated and then ejected as a paste, which can be moulded into new objects as it cools. \"There\u0027s no difference [from] the equivalent polypropylene material that it\u0027s based against, the processing temperatures and parameters are all identical,\" says Brett Nixon, a manager at the plant. \"When you are handling the finished product, you do take a while to adjust to the fact that this has been in somebody\u0027s mouth previously. \u0027But once you get over that fear it\u0027s easy. By recycling it and giving it another lease of life it\u0027s helping the environment, it\u0027s an absolutely fantastic idea.\" Industry response\nThe UK Parliament has considered imposing taxes on chewing gum companies if they do not do more to combat gum litter. Anna\u0027s project has been given financial support from Wrigley, one of the largest manufacturers. It also provides her with surplus material from its Plymouth factory to add to her supply. Alex Hunter-Dunn, a spokesman for Wrigley, explained why the company backs the project. \"Gumdrop is a really creative and innovative way to get people responsibly disposing of their gum and binning it. We fundamentally believe that behaviour change is the only long-term sustainable solution to tackle the issue and we are very much behind that.\" Other approaches are being tried to beat the scourge of gum litter. Researchers have worked on a synthetic chewing gum that is biodegradable and will wash off the streets more easily, which is also the case with an organic chewing gum, made from Chicle gum native to Central America, which has a small market. But in the current market, dominated by synthetic, non-biodegradable gum, Anna thinks her method is the best option on the table. \"I do believe that through right design, \" she says, \"we can actually change the way people behave.\" Follow Dougal Shaw on Twitter @dougalshawbbc You can learn more about recycling chewing gum in the latest People Fixing the World podcastfrom the BBC World Service ","date":1520296781000,"topics":["University of Winchester","Recycling","World Hacks"]}

{"hash":"f8ce034d550ca65527e864241dcc5660","title":"Sound of speed","author":"bbc","feed":"science","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-43290177","content":"A British team is developing a car that will be capable of reaching 1,000mph (1,610km/h). Powered by a rocket bolted to a Eurofighter-Typhoon jet engine, the vehicle aims to show its potential by going progressively faster, year after year. In 2018, Bloodhound wants to run above 500mph. In 2019, the goal is to raise the existing world land speed record (763mph; 1,228km/h) to 800mph. And in 2020, the intention is to exceed 1,000mph. The racing will take place on Hakskeen Pan in Northern Cape, South Africa. Plans are developing nicely for our forthcoming \"Bloodhound 500\" test session later this year. Bloodhound\u0027s chief executive, Richard Noble, has just returned from a hugely busy week of meetings in South Africa. Richard met with the South African Government, the British High Commission team, a whole list of companies (who all want to help) and a range of national media. No surprise that everyone is getting excited about Bloodhound going to South Africa this Autumn. While we\u0027re busy planning the event schedule for our test runs (lots of you keep asking for more details; I promise we\u0027ll update everyone soon!), there\u0027s plenty of research still going on to understand how the car will behave. One of the key things we are looking at is noise. How much noise will the car generate? How will this noise affect the structure of the car, the driver (me!) and the watching crowds? The noise will come from two main sources. The jet engine and the rocket motor will create a lot (and I mean A LOT) of noise at the back end of the car, with a bit of jet intake jet noise over the cockpit as well. At supersonic speeds, I don\u0027t have to worry about the jet intake noise anymore, as I\u0027ll be travelling faster than the sound the jet engine is making. However, at that point, the supersonic shockwaves start to generate some fairly large \"acoustic energy effects\". In other words, they will probably create even more noise than the jet intake, so it\u0027s going to be noisy whatever speed we\u0027re doing. You may be surprised to hear that I\u0027m not that worried about the noise levels in the cockpit. During our \"slow speed\" (200mph) tests at Cornwall Airport Newquay last year, we found that the cockpit was not as noisy as we had first thought. If we find it\u0027s getting too noisy when we go faster (like supersonic fast), then we can fit a lot more sound-proofing. We\u0027ve already got a big box of something called \"Basotech\" (the same sound-absorbing foam that Ariane rockets use), ready to fit in the cockpit if required. We\u0027re not too worried about the effects on the crowd either, as there are some easy solutions. First, we\u0027ll be monitoring the noise levels at the edge of the track, when the car runs. If it gets too noisy, then we\u0027ll simply move the crowd line back further (don\u0027t worry if you\u0027re coming to see us, it won\u0027t be too far and you\u0027ll still get a fabulous view!). In fact, the main problem may come when we get round to timing our final runs, to set a new World Land Speed Record. At this point we need FIA timekeepers, who traditionally use a few hundred metres of cable to record their timing light signals. We\u0027ve already warned them that they are probably going to need wireless timing equipment, as they are likely to be a kilometre of more back from the track. The real thing we\u0027re concerned about is the noise effects on the car. Back in 1997, when we set the current World Land Speed Record, we saw quite a lot of acoustic damage to the car. This included cracking of the titanium panels at the rear of the car, due to the shattering noise of the jet engine exhaust. The supersonic shockwaves also did their fair share of damage. We had to replace one of the body panels under the car, which was cracked by shockwave vibrations. Things like rocket motors can produce so much energy that they risk destroying the vehicle (usually a spacecraft) that they are attached to. For example, the Space Shuttle had to use massive water sprays to damp down the acoustic energy at launch. And I do mean \"massive\u0027 - they sprayed over one million litres of water on to the launch pad in just over half a minute, to prevent acoustic damage to the payload and crew. That\u0027s a lot of water and a lot of noise. Bloodhound is not going to be using anything the size of the Shuttle main engines, which is just as well, as there\u0027s nowhere on the car to keep a million litres of water. We can\u0027t just ignore the problem, though. Between them, the Rolls-Royce jet engine and the Nammo hybrid rocket will make Bloodhound SSC the loudest (as well as the fastest) car in history. We need to make sure that all this noise is not going to damage the back end of the car. This is where our new best friend Nick Eaton of Space Acoustics comes in. Nick is developing an \"advanced numerical solution to noise from turbulent mixing\" for Bloodhound. In short, that means he\u0027s modelling the noise. His first model is for a speed of Mach 0.8, in other words 80% of the speed of sound, or around 600mph. That\u0027s comfortably above our Bloodhound 500 target for this year of 500+ mph, to give us some worst-case noise figures to look at for this year\u0027s testing. This year\u0027s test runs will be with our EJ200 jet engine only, as the rocket development will not be completed until next year. For the test programme, that makes things simpler, as we can focus on two cases - jet engine at full power (measuring the total noise exposure of the car) and jet engine off (measuring the noise from the airflow only, as the car slows down). That will give us accurate figures for the airflow noise and, by measuring the difference with power on, for the jet engine noise. Nick can then use these figures to improve the accuracy of his model (if required), before we fit the rocket and start doing supersonic runs. Before I talk about the expected noise levels, I have to touch on the difficult subject of noise measurement. Nick\u0027s figures are looking at something called the Sound Pressure Level (SPL), which is a measure of the pressure caused by the sound waves. This is ideal for Bloodhound\u0027s requirements, as we want to understand how the sound might affect the structure of the car, so it\u0027s the pressure that we\u0027re interested in. Slightly confusingly, the sound pressure is different to the power or energy of the sound wave, for reasons I won\u0027t attempt to explain - just take my word for it. The SPL is measured relative to a reference pressure, which is the quietest sound that you can hear. To make things a bit more complicated, it\u0027s measured on a logarithmic scale, in units called decibels, or dB. The quietest sound your ear can detect is reference pressure at 0 dB(SPL). On this scale, 20 dB(SPL) is 10 times the sound intensity of 0 dB, and 40 dB(SPL) is 100 times the intensity. Confused? Yes, me too. Let\u0027s stick to some simple examples. If 0 dB(SPL) is the quietest sound you can hear, then the \"pain threshold\" of sound, where the noise starts to cause you injury, is around 120-130 dB(SPL). The variation is because the pain threshold is slightly subjective: a really loud (130 dB(SPL)) rock concert may well be \"great music\" to a 20-year old and \"painful noise\" to someone over 40…. With 130 dB(SPL) as a \"painfully loud\" reference (at least for me - I\u0027m over 40), the sound levels around BLOODHOUND may make a bit more sense. The predicted noise level (SPL) at the cockpit is 135 dB, so it may not be comfortable, but it\u0027s nothing to be scared of. I\u0027ll be wearing a full-face helmet and Ultimate Ear moulded earplugs (like you see the F1 drivers using), so I\u0027m well protected against this level of noise. Of more interest is the prediction for noise at the back on the car, where the SPL figure is 150 dB. This is really quite loud. Unhelpfully, most of the examples of this kind of noise level are things like military jet engines or heavy artillery gunfire. Unless you work with military jets or heavy artillery, this doesn\u0027t mean much. More exciting is the sort of effects that it has on the human body, which are variously quoted as \"chest cavity vibrates\", \"giddiness\" and \"choking\". This noise level will damage more than just your hearing. OK, we\u0027ll make sure that we all keep well back. Question is, what\u0027s it going to do to the car itself? Now that we have this data, our engineering team can start to look at exactly this question. Better still, we can measure the effects on the car when we start testing it later this year. If you want to see how we get on, come along and join us for our first high-speed test session this autumn in South Africa. We\u0027d love to see you there. Don\u0027t forget to bring your earplugs.

{"hash":"3ff6e75fa61afefe76bffb6091cece64","title":"Fast charge","author":"bbc","feed":"science","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43285885","content":"Imagine being able to charge your electric car in minutes rather than hours, or your smartphone in seconds. That\u0027s the enticing prospect being touted by researchers who reckon they\u0027ve discovered a new material that could boost the performance of a carbon-based supercapacitor - sometimes called an ultracapacitor - a type of energy storage device that can be charged very quickly and offload its power very quickly, too. Dr Donald Highgate, director of research at Superdielectrics Ltd, says a material he originally developed for soft contact lenses is also surprisingly good at holding an electrostatic field. Very simply, supercapacitors don\u0027t produce electricity through chemical reactions as conventional batteries do, they create these electrostatic fields. Dr Highgate is working with Bristol and Surrey universities to develop supercapacitors using the new polymer and hopes that they could eventually rival, or even surpass, lithium-ion (li-ion) batteries - so long as they manage to replicate prototype performance on a large scale. So far, supercapacitors have been good at providing quick bursts of power - to start a car engine, for example, or to give trains a boost when accelerating. They\u0027re also well-suited to harvesting energy from vehicles when they brake, making them an important component in electric vehicles. And national electricity grids use them to provide quick power top-ups when balancing supply and demand. South Korea\u0027s capital Seoul is hoping to have 3,500 supercapacitor-powered buses operating by 2020, and they\u0027re also being used in Shanghai, China. European car maker PSA Peugeot Citroen has been using them in its cars since 2010 - supercapacitor maker Maxwell Technologies says more than a million vehicles now incorporate its products. But to date, supercapacitors haven\u0027t been very good at holding much power or holding on to that power for very long. This poor energy density, as it\u0027s called, the amount of power they can hold per kilogramme, has put them at a significant disadvantage to li-ion batteries. More Technology of Business\n\"The two main advantages of conventional supercapacitors over batteries are their ability to handle much higher charge and discharge rates, and their longer cycle life,\" says Gareth Hinds, Fellow of the UK\u0027s National Physical Laboratory. \"The downside is that they tend to be relatively high cost and can only store a few seconds-, or at most, minutes-worth of power.\" This isn\u0027t a problem when your supercapacitor is being used to power a tool on a factory assembly line, for example. It can be recharged in seconds once it\u0027s placed back in its charging dock. But it is if you\u0027re in an electric car or bus that needs recharging every few miles. Taavi Madiberk, chief executive and co-founder of Skeleton Technologies, a supercapacitor maker based in Estonia, Germany and Finland, says his products incorporate layers of graphene - a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice - and other carbon-based materials in its supercapacitors. These layers have a huge surface area - just 1g of graphene can cover 2,000 sq m, says Mr Madiberk. This allows them to hold on to a lot more power. His firm\u0027s products are already used in hybrid vehicles, particularly buses and lorries. In one experiment, they installed supercapacitors in a Sainsbury\u0027s supermarket diesel-electric delivery van and \"achieved 32% fuel savings\", says Mr Madiberk. But he acknowledges that in the short-term, combining supercapacitors with li-ion batteries is probably the best way to enjoy the best of both worlds, particularly in electric vehicles. Ulrik Grape, chief executive of NaWa technologies, another supercapacitor maker based in the South of France, agrees, saying: \"Supercapacitors don\u0027t store as much energy but their response is instantaneous. So a supercapacitor could handle acceleration and energy recovery under braking - taking care of the stressful part of a battery\u0027s life - possibly doubling or tripling a battery\u0027s life expectancy.\" NaWa\u0027s technology involves electrodes made from \"vertically aligned carbon and graphene nanotubes that can store the energy on the surface of these tubes,\" explains Mr Grape. These tubes, which are coated with another carbon-based material, are so tiny you can fit 10 billion of them in a square centimetre. As carbon is a light material, incorporating supercapacitors into li-ion batteries would also reduce the overall weight, and this would improve the range performance of an electric vehicle. A Formula E racing car\u0027s battery, currently made by Williams Advanced Engineering, weighs 300kg, but this could be reduced by a third to 200kg, NaWa believes, without any loss of range. \"We think the ability to charge and discharge a battery fast will be one of the most important things in the future,\" says Mr Grape. \"We don\u0027t have as much energy as a lithium-ion battery but we can do many more cycles - charges and discharges - up to a million. Carbon is such a robust material.\" By contrast, a normal battery, which relies on chemical reactions to create electricity, eventually wears out once those chemicals lose their potency - after about 3,000 to 5,000 cycles of charging and discharging. Another advantage of supercapacitors, makers say, is that they don\u0027t require rare materials, such as cobalt. Of course, supercapacitors don\u0027t mean the end of traditional batteries by any means. Li-ion technology is still being improved by about 5-10% each year. New forms of energy storage will be critical to the success of renewable energy as a replacement for fossil fuels. When the sun doesn\u0027t shine or the wind doesn\u0027t blow, we\u0027ll need to access stored energy very quickly to plug the gap. As well as traditional energy storage methods, such as pumped hydro, flywheels, compressed gas and large battery arrays, highly efficient supercapacitors could eventually become a crucial component in a fully sustainable energy network. But these are early days. \"Polymer-based supercapacitors are emerging as a promising technology,\" concludes Gareth Hinds, \"but there is a lot of work still to do to achieve the required energy storage capacity without compromising on power, lifetime and cost.\" ","date":1520295329000,"topics":["Renewable energy"]}

{"hash":"d3e51cfa914414ac650f58ddc3f75f9a","title":"Water stress","author":"bbc","feed":"science","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-43252435","content":"A recent report has said the south Indian city of Bangalore could be doomed, like Cape Town in South Africa, to face the threat of running out of drinking water. But is this really the case? The BBC\u0027s Imran Qureshi investigates. The fact that Bangalore is under \"water stress\" cannot be denied. The term is used to refer to pressure on water resources which causes problems like shortages. Officials and experts admit the growth of the city has put pressure on its water resources, particularly because in the last few years alone more than 100 villages have been absorbed into this rapidly expanding metropolis, known as India\u0027s Silicon Valley. In 2012, nine million people lived in Bangalore. Now, there are 11 million. Government officials say shortage of water is a very real problem, particularly in the peripheral areas of the city which are already dependant on tankers for drinking water supply. These tankers get their supply from borewells, but as demand increases they are being forced to dig deeper and deeper to find water. The Bangalore water supply and sewerage board ( BWSSB), the agency that provides drinking water and manages the city\u0027s sewage system, acknowledges that in 2014, a survey predicted Bangalore was on the verge of running out of water. But, they say the situation has changed since then - one critical government decision just may have staved off complete disaster, at least for now. In 2013, the government decided to divert an additional 10 thousand million cubic feet of water from the Cauvery river to Bangalore for its drinking water needs. The Cauvery is the principal source of water for not just the city, but also for the irrigation needs of much of Karnataka state where Bangalore is located. And Cauvery water is precious. The state has been involved for more than a century in a dispute over sharing water resources from the river with neighbouring Tamil Nadu state. The Supreme Court has had to intervene on multiple occasions, but has also permitted states to prioritise the use of water for drinking purposes. \"The current supply of water to Bangalore amounts to about 100 litres of water per person per day,\" Tushar Girinath, chairman of the water supply board, told the BBC. Officials estimate that by diverting the river water, the city will gain a little more than 50% of its current supply. The project, called \"Cauvery Water Supply Stage Five\", is funded by the Japanese International Cooperation Agency. The additional supply is expected to help Bangalore provide drinking water to a 225 sq km (87 sq-mile) area that is currently dependent upon water supplied via borewells and tankers. In addition to the additional supply from the Cauvery, the city will in the next 18 months also receive water from another river called the Nethravati. Mr Girinath said this would make the water position of the city more \"comfortable\". \"Yes, we will face some water stress until 2023. But we certainly are not facing a crisis, because we are augmenting the supply,\" he said. Officials say the plan has taken the rapid growth of the city into account. Merely increasing supply will not be enough to ensure Bangalore has adequate water supply though. The city\u0027s residents also need to participate in conservation and harvesting efforts. But this has not been the case so far. The water board has run massive campaigns promoting rainwater harvesting in an effort to help replenish ground water supplies. But this has got a disappointing response. It is mandatory for people to construct rainwater harvesting facilities at their homes, but this is often ignored. The board in fact, collects a sum of more than 20m rupees (about $300,000; £222,000) in fines every month from people who have not complied. \"Bangalore\u0027s annual rainfall alone could give the city 2,740 million litres of water a day,\" Vishwanath Srikantaiah, a water expert, told the BBC. Mr Girinath adds that people will also have to begin recycling water using their own sewage treatment plants. \"They will also have to understand that the board cannot provide treated water. Our sewage treatment plants are so huge that we have set them up outside the city. So, we expect people living in complexes housing 50 or more apartments to construct smaller plants to treat water for their own needs,\" he said. A sewage treatment plant small enough to be used by an apartment costs around 750,000 rupees to install. People living in smaller houses or slums will get free treated water from the water board. \"Of the 100 litres used by every person per day, people need only 20 litres for cooking, drinking water and bathing purposes. The remaining 80 litres is used for non-potable purposes like flushing toilets, cleaning floors and washing cars,\u0027\u0027 BN Tyagaraja, who headed an expert panel to look for additional water sources, told the BBC. \"The citizens have to realise that water is a scarce commodity. Not just in Bangalore but across the world. We need to conserve water,\" he said. Mr Srikantaiah agrees. \"Bangalore is not likely to run out of water but we will have to manage it well,\" he says.

{"hash":"e5eed2bd970377f217670efa98599a53","title":"Lassa fever","author":"bbc","feed":"science","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-43211086","content":"Since the beginning of the year, Nigeria has been gripped by an outbreak of a deadly disease. Lassa fever is one of a number of illnesses which can cause dangerous epidemics, but for which no vaccine currently exists. Lassa fever is not a new disease, but the current outbreak is unprecedented, spreading faster and further than ever before. Health workers are overstretched, and a number have themselves become infected and died. The potentially fatal disease is a so-called \"viral haemorrhagic fever\", which can affect many organs, and damage the body\u0027s blood vessels. But it is difficult to treat. Most people who catch Lassa will have only mild symptoms such as fever, headache and general weakness. They may have none at all. However, in severe cases, it can mimic another deadly haemorrhagic fever, Ebola, causing bleeding through the nose, mouth and other parts of the body. Lassa fever normally has a fatality rate of about one per cent. But in the Nigerian outbreak it is thought to be more than 20% among confirmed and probable cases, according to the country\u0027s Centre for Disease Control. Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria\n22% fatality rate among confirmed and probable cases 1081 suspected cases (1 January - 25 February) 90 deaths 14 health care workers affected in six states About 90 people are thought to have died so far, but the true number may be much higher, because Lassa is so hard to diagnose. Women who contract the disease late in pregnancy face an 80% chance of losing their child, or dying themselves. In the early stages it\u0027s almost impossible to distinguish from other common diseases like malaria and dengue. With no readily available test, the only way to confirm a diagnosis is to analyse a blood or tissue sample in one of small number of specialised laboratories. The disease was first identified in the Nigerian town of Lassa in 1969, after an outbreak in a mission hospital. It has since been seen in many West African countries including Ghana, Mali and Sierra Leone. However, this outbreak is causing particular concern because the number of cases is unusually high for the time of year. Health officials are working to understand why. Outbreaks can be influenced by seasonal weather conditions, which affect the numbers of the virus\u0027s natural host - the multimammate rat. These small mammals are common across West Africa, where they easily find their way into homes. Another possibility is that the high number of cases reflects heightened public awareness. Or it\u0027s possible that something about the virus has changed. Most people catch Lassa fever from anything contaminated with rat urine, faeces, blood or saliva - through eating, drinking or simply handling contaminated objects in the home. It can also pass from person to person through bodily fluids, meaning healthcare workers and people taking care of sick relatives without protective equipment are particularly at risk. The incubation period for Lassa is up to three weeks. Researchers are trying to work out whether - like Ebola - Lassa can stay in the body and be passed on through sexual contact even after illness subsides. Nigeria has a strong public health system, and is used to dealing with epidemics like this. The World Health Organization (WHO) is working with Nigerian authorities to help coordinate the response and the UK government has deployed a team of experts from its Public Health Rapid Support Team. Those living in affected areas are being advised to take basic precautions: blocking holes that may allow rats to enter their homes, disposing of rubbish in covered dustbins, and storing food and water in sealed containers. People are advised to wear protective gloves when caring for anyone who may have Lassa fever, and to carry out safe burial practices. Despite these measures, the fight against Lassa - and other infectious diseases - is hampered by a lack of effective medical tools like diagnostic tests, treatments and vaccines. It is likely that a vaccine could be found for Lassa - reducing the possibility of an outbreak becoming a global health emergency - but as with other epidemic diseases that mainly affect poorer countries, progress has stalled. Vaccine development is a long, complex and costly process. This is especially true for emerging epidemic diseases, where a prototype vaccine can usually only be tested where there is an outbreak. A new organisation called CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations) - set up in 2017 with financial support from the Wellcome Trust, national governments and the Bill \u0026 Melinda Gates Foundation - hopes to accelerate vaccine production. Lassa is one of the diseases on its hit list and it\u0027s hoped one or more promising vaccines will be ready for large-scale testing in the next five years. The WHO has drawn up a list of other serious, but often poorly understood diseases, with the potential for devastating outbreaks, including MERS, Nipah, Rift Valley Fever and, of course, Ebola. It plans to highlight gaps in our knowledge of these diseases and to begin further research. But research alone isn\u0027t enough. Stronger health systems are needed in the countries where epidemics are most likely to arise. This could mean building better healthcare facilities and training staff to recognise and respond to outbreaks. It will also mean working with communities to understand how to identify outbreaks at an early stage and prevent their spread.

Putting a chip under your skin is not so very different from getting a piercing or tattoo, argued one of the panellists - except there was often less blood. For some, transhumanism - the theory that the human race can evolve beyond its physical and mental limitations with the help of technology - is a crucial part of the advancement of society. Bio-hacker Lepht Anonym has nine implants and strongly believes what she does will benefit humankind as well as her own curiosity. But she admits it can be painful. \"The magnets in my fingers really, really hurt. They hurt so much that your vision goes white for a bit. Really, really painful.\" The magnets allow her to sense electromagnetic radiation so she can tell if a device is on or off, whether a microwave is running and identify where power lines are. All of which, she admits, is \"not hugely useful\". She also has a chip under her skin that lets her interact with her phone and unlock doors. She hopes that the \"primitive results\" she has achieved can be used by other, more skilled people, to build something better. \"The bio-hacking community is a co-operative. It is about improving the quality of life for people but in a practical way.\" Hygiene issues\nNot everyone is a fan of the trend. Andreas Sjostrom, who leads CapGemini\u0027s global mobility practice, had an implant in 2015 which allowed him to download his customer number from airline tickets and get through security gates with a swipe of his hand. It got him noticed by security staff at the airport and worked but he has since become more cynical about the technology. \"In order for this to be widely used or adopted it has to improve on the current situation,\" he said. \"The hardware that reads such chips is designed for a flat surface such as you\u0027d find in a card,\" he explained, adding that chips in hands are often not recognised by the readers. \"And, if everyone is pressing their hands on the reader, that is less hygienic.\" It is estimated that more than 10,000 people around the world have chip implants in their bodies, making it far from mainstream but clearly a growing trend. The current range of implants includes magnets that are installed into fingertips, radio frequency identification chips (RFiD) implanted in hands, and even LED lights that can shine beneath the skin. Chips used for opening doors carry a unique serial number the can be read by a device attached to whatever you want to open and one chip can carry multiple numbers meaning you do not need a separate chip for everything you want to access. Amal Graafstra provides such implants via his firm Dangerous Things and thinks there are three good reasons to have an implant. \"We all carry with us keys, wallet and phone. These are major burdens, they are so important for modern life but everyone hates carrying them. \"With a simple implant that uses less energy and carries less risk than an ear-piercing, you can replace them.\" He is able to access not only his house but his car via the implant under his skin, although he admits that getting the device to work with his car required \"a bit of hacking\". But he envisions a future where chips can do far more - and that, he predicts, will attract more people to the community of bio-hacking. \"If someone could use an implant to get on the train, buy coffee, secure their computer, secure their data, get into their house, drive a car - all of these possible applications will compel a lot more adoption.\" For Matt Eagles, the implant he has in his brain is not a luxury so much as a necessity to cope with the Parkinson\u0027s disease he has had since he was a child. He has two 15cm electrodes that run deep into his brain and create two bumps on his head which he affectionately refers to as \"baby giraffe horns\". The implants are attached to a pulse generator in his chest, which disrupts the electrical signals to his brain and allows him to walk. \"They have given me back my dignity. When you struggle to turn over in bed at night or can\u0027t get out of bed to go to the bathroom, to be suddenly able to do so is a huge plus.\" It has also given him back confidence to pursue his love of photography - he was an accredited football photographer at the 2012 Olympics - and, perhaps most importantly, he has got married. Many regard medicine as being the real mainstream application for bio-hacking, from cochlear implants which improve hearing loss to smart pills that can be ingested and access, analyse and manipulate bodily functions. Some bio-hackers are ready to go one step further. In October 2017, Josiah Zayner, who has a doctorate in biochemistry and molecular biophysics from the University of Chicago, injected his arm with DNA from a gene-editing tool called Crispr. It is a stunt that he has since said he regrets but his attempt to edit his own genes - in this case to trigger a genetic change in his cells to increase muscle mass - made headlines at the time, largely around the ethics of such experimentation. \"There is a continuum between therapy and enhancement and it is difficult to draw the line between where medicine ends and enhancement begins,\" said Prof John Harris, an ethicist from the University of Manchester. \"As for gene editing the tools are available and relatively cheap and easy to use, but people would be extremely ill-advised to try it.\" There has also been objections on religious grounds from some, with Mr Sjostrom receiving negative feedback from a group in the Christian community. \"They see implantable technology and assume the end of times are here and that it is the mark of the beast. It is important to know how to deal with this technology from a theological point of view.\" ","date":1520049711000,"topics":[]}

{"hash":"ab153299b729b7f746bfed25fc14b91c","title":"Scarcer snow?","author":"bbc","feed":"science","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43158532","content":"Cities across Europe have been hit by a Siberian snow blast this week - also known as \"the Beast from the East\". Even Mediterranean islands such as Corsica and Capri haven\u0027t escaped; parts of Spain and Italy have seen their first snowfall in years; and in the UK, there has been widespread disruption to transport and schools. But despite this wintry weather, in some places snow is actually getting rarer. For it to snow, you need a big enough cloud and, perhaps most obviously, temperatures close to or below freezing. Data from the principal organisations monitoring global temperatures all show they are rising. For example, according to Nasa, global average temperatures were 0.9C higher in 2017 than the 1951-80 average. And in the past 27 years, there is no year when annual global average temperatures have been cooler than the 1961-90 average. So how is this increase in temperature affecting snowfall? The UK picture\nAccording to a report by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), there is evidence that the number of times snow is observed in a year has reduced - a sense of this change can be gained by looking at the animation below of data from the Met Office. If you look at Merseyside, for example, between 1961 and 1990, the area would normally have about 20 to 30 days of snow falling each year. By 1981-2010, that had reduced to about 10 to 20 days per year. Of course, there\u0027s variation across the country. Elevation of the land is an important factor as air cools by 1C for each 100m (330ft) increase in altitude, so upland parts of the UK have a greater number of days of snowfall than low areas. North-eastern areas have more snow than milder south-western areas. Snowfall in the UK is often difficult to predict, with 10ths of a degree Celsius making the difference between cold rain or snow - a nightmare for forecasters. However, the Met Office Regional Climate model simulation has shown that the trend of decreasing days of winter snow in the UK will probably continue. Will snow become rarer in other parts of the world?\nNot necessarily - it\u0027s a mixed picture. According to a report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) the fraction of precipitation falling as snow in winter has changed little in places that are more than 55 degrees north of the equator. That\u0027s because the air is already very cold and rising temperatures haven\u0027t made much difference. In some cases, higher temperatures have actually led to more snow. Around the Great Lakes of North America, for example, there\u0027s actually been a large increase in the amount of lake-effect snow observed. In the past, the Great Lakes would have been more often covered by ice in winter, effectively putting a lid on them and preventing moisture from evaporating into the atmosphere to make snow. With less ice on the lakes in recent winters, there\u0027s more evaporation - and so more snow. But the IPCC did report declines in the proportion of annual precipitation falling as snow in some specific areas: This may be due to more marginal temperatures or an earlier onset of spring there. So for some, snow could become rarer in the future, but this may cause further headaches. Disruption from snow tends to be worse in areas where snow occurs less frequently, whether from lack of investment in snow-clearing infrastructure, or people just being unused to the conditions. So even if snow does become scarcer in a future warmer world, that doesn\u0027t mean we\u0027ll see an end to problems on the roads, rails and airports caused by snow anytime soon.

{"hash":"2f42b48f4f1748d28db2823dfdd8019d","title":"Burn or bury","author":"bbc","feed":"science","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-43120041","content":"Should we burn waste plastic - or bury it? Since China refused last month to accept any more foreign waste for recycling, the UK is facing a challenge. How can it recycle more of its own waste? And should it bury or burn the low-grade waste that it can\u0027t recycle? We\u0027re trying to answer the second question. And it certainly divides opinions. So what are the facts about plastic waste? Well, according to the HMRC\u0027s UK trade info website, about 800,000 tonnes of plastic waste was exported from the UK for recycling to nations like China in 2014. News reports suggest much of this was contaminated by other rubbish, and had to be burned. The UK itself was left with 1,244,774 tonnes of packaging sent either to landfill or incineration in 2016. The National Packaging Waste Database estimates that 1,015,226 tonnes of plastics packaging was recycled in 2016. Remember, this is packaging, not all plastic waste. So should we burn our hard-to-recycle waste, or bury it? The case for burning\nHere\u0027s the case for burning. Plastic is made from oil and gas, and it creates a lot of heat when it\u0027s burned. So at first sight it makes sense to harness that by burning it in an incinerator to make electricity. It\u0027s even more efficient if the incinerator can capture the waste heat from the process and use it to warm offices and homes. Burning plastic this way currently substitutes in some places for burning dirty fossil fuels like oil or coal. Mark Pawsey, the Conservative MP for Rugby, is chairman of the All-Party Group for the Packaging Manufacturing Industry. He told the Commons: \"Waste is used to generate the heat that enables the cement company based in my constituency to manufacture cement. \"That strikes me as a much better use of the calorific value of packaging than sending it to landfill.\" His argument is supported by the people who run incineration - the Environmental Services Association (ESA). Its director Jacob Hayler told us: \"It is better to recover energy from non-recyclable waste through (incineration), than send it to landfill.\" He quotes the government\u0027s Digest of UK Energy Statistics (DUKES) saying that in 2016, the waste used to fuel Energy from Waste (EfW) was equivalent to replacing 2.5m tonnes of virgin fossil fuel oil. Mr Hayler says that overall greenhouse gas emissions from incineration are lower than from landfill. So it seems there\u0027s a strong case for incineration - but it\u0027s not quite that simple. Because those statistics are based on the incineration of general waste including plastics - not of plastic waste alone. Much of our household waste in landfills does indeed create greenhouse gases that heat the world, unless they are captured as landfill gas. But this doesn\u0027t apply to plastics, which are extremely stable. They don\u0027t break down in landfill, so don\u0027t emit greenhouse gases. And, in fact, there\u0027s a strong case against incinerating plastics. So what\u0027s the case for burial?\nBurning plastic creates harmful dioxins and if incinerators are inefficient, these leak into the environment. Modern incinerators are said to have largely solved this problem. But climate change is another consideration. The consultancy Eunomia says plastics burned in incinerators set up to generate only electricity create heat at 25% efficiency. This is much lower than the 55% efficiency for new gas-fired power stations. Dominic Hogg from Eunomia told BBC News: \"When coal is phased out for generating electricity, incineration of unrecycled waste will be the most CO2-intensive form of generation. \"This doesn\u0027t make sense if the government\u0027s trying to reduce CO2 emissions - unless the government takes drastic action to reduce the amount of plastic in unrecycled waste.\" Environment groups also fear that if the UK builds new incinerators to cope with the stockpile created by China\u0027s rejection of waste plastic, the policy will lock in a demand for burning waste plastic that ideally should get recycled. The government seems to have been persuaded by this argument. The environment minister Therese Coffey told the Commons: \"In environmental terms, it is generally better to bury plastic than to burn it.\" Capturing carbon emissions\nIndeed we could go one step further and make the case that burying waste plastic in landfill is actually a cheap form of carbon capture and storage. Governments have been promising for decades to develop plants that will capture the carbon emissions from power stations and force them into underground rocks. Burying plastic would have the same effect of locking up unwanted carbon at a fraction of the cost. Elena Polisano, Oceans Campaigner for Greenpeace UK reluctantly agrees. She told BBC News: \"We should reduce, reuse, and recycle, in that order. \"When we get to the stage of deciding whether to burn or bury waste, we have already failed, failed some more and then failed again. \"However, it is safer to contain that failure than to spread it through the atmosphere in the form of toxic gases.\" The question may seem rather academic. But it is highly pertinent for a government whose environment secretary is preparing a new plan for waste - and who has stated that the UK must \"stop offshoring our dirt\".

It is often said the world\u0027s next world war will be fought over water and there are few places as tense as the River Nile. Egypt and Ethiopia have a big disagreement, Sudan is in the middle, and a big geopolitical shift is being played out along the world\u0027s longest river. There\u0027s been talk about a dam on the Blue Nile for many years, but when Ethiopia started to build, the Arab Spring was underway and Egypt was distracted. \"Egypt was the gift of the Nile\" the pharaohs said, and they worshiped the river as a god. Explore the Nile with 360 video\nJoin the BBC\u0027s Africa correspondent Alastair Leithead and his team, travelling from the Blue Nile\u0027s source to the sea - through Ethiopia and Sudan into Egypt. This 360° video is a version of the first VR documentary series from BBC News. To view the full films, click here. For thousands of years, and more recently buoyed by British colonialism, Egypt has wielded political influence over the Nile. But the ambition of Ethiopia is changing all that. There are few African countries with a plan to deal with the doubling of the continent\u0027s population over the next 30 years. Yet despite its political challenges and its limited freedoms, industrial parks are being built as Ethiopia seeks to transform itself into a middle-income country, and so it needs electricity. Africa\u0027s largest hydroelectric power station and one of the world\u0027s largest dams will do that, but with 85% of the river emerging from the Ethiopian highlands, Egypt is concerned its rival has the capability to control the flow of the river. \"It\u0027s one of the most important flagship projects for Ethiopia,\" says Seleshi Bekele, the country\u0027s Minister for Water, Irrigation and Electricity. \"It\u0027s not about control of the flow, but providing opportunity for us to develop ourselves through energy development. It has a lot of benefit for the downstream countries.\" And Sudan certainly welcomes it. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is just a few kilometres from the border and the pylons are already in place, waiting for the power generation to begin and for cheap, renewable power to fizz through the cables. Dams also regulate the flow of the river. At the moment the difference between high water and low water level in Sudan is 8m, and that makes its vast irrigation projects harder to manage. With the dam in place, the difference will be 2m and the flow of the river will come year-round. \"For Sudan it\u0027s wonderful,\" says says Osama Daoud Abdellatif, the owner of the Dal Group which runs farms and irrigation projects. \"It\u0027s the best thing that\u0027s happened for a long time and I think the combination of energy and regular water levels is a great blessing.\" He understands that Egypt is worried, as the UN predicts the country will start suffering water shortages by 2025. \"The Nile is the lifeline of Egypt, so for them, I wouldn\u0027t say they are paranoid, but they are very concerned about anything that you do with that water.\" Any threat to Egypt\u0027s water is considered a threat to its sovereignty. \"It\u0027s very much a game changer, a new order is beginning in the whole region now,\" believes Rawia Tawfik, an Egyptian academic working in Germany. \"Ethiopia for the first time is combining both the physical power of being an upstream country that can in one way or another control the River Nile\u0027s flow, and the economic power of being able to construct a dam depending on its own domestic resources.\" And Egypt\u0027s minister of water resources and irrigation, Mohamed Abdel Aty, is extremely angry. \"We are responsible for a nation of about 100 million\", he says. \"If the water that\u0027s coming to Egypt reduced by 2% we would lose about 200,000 acres of land. \"One acre at least makes one family survive. A family in Egypt is average family size about five persons. So this means about one million will be jobless. \"It is an international security issue.\" Hydroelectric power stations do not consume water, but the speed with which Ethiopia fills up the dam will affect the flow downstream. They would like the water to be generating power as soon as possible, but it should take time to fill up a reservoir which is going to be bigger than Greater London and will flood the Nile for 250km (155 miles) upstream. If it is filled within three years the level of the river will be affected, but over six or seven years it won\u0027t have a major impact on water level. Negotiations between Egypt and Ethiopia are not going well. The discussions aren\u0027t even at the stage of assessing the impact, but are still about how that will be determined. Sudan and Egypt are also at loggerheads over how much water Sudan uses - and how that amount may increase when the dam is finished. The irony is Egypt did in the 1960s exactly what Ethiopia is doing today, when it built the Aswan High Dam. For a revolutionary post-colonial country it was a proud national achievement, and Ethiopia sees it in the same way. Ethiopia wants to pay for this project itself without international help. Government workers are giving a month\u0027s salary a year to the project - and not all are happy about that. There is a lottery to fund the dam and bonds are being put up for sale. The dam is impressive. After five years it is two-thirds finished - and it already crosses the river. There is nothing Egypt can do about it, except take military action which would be extreme. That is why diplomacy and collaboration are the only means of resolving this issue. But when issues like nationalism and the relative strength and importance of countries is concerned, it muddies the water. The world\u0027s first war over water can be avoided on the Nile, and it could even be an example of how to resolve complex disagreements over water. But it will take a lot more effort to navigate an agreement between Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt. ","date":1519436296000,"topics":["Nile","Sudan","Egypt","Ethiopia"]}

{"hash":"a9eb09f96d7c214116b4844e4701996c","title":"Great White demystified","author":"bbc","feed":"science","link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-42956475","content":"\"When you\u0027re on top of the water, and you just see the fin, I think it\u0027s more scary because it\u0027s the unknown. But when you are underwater and you see the shark it is much less scary. When I saw him for the first time, he was bigger than expected and so much more colourful.\" This is what a 26-year-old woman, a tourist from England, told researchers after going down in an aluminium cage into the choppy waters off the coast of Bluff, a southern seaport town in New Zealand, to watch the great white shark, the largest predatory fish in the world. Working in what they call one of the five great white shark \"hotspots\" in the world, two researchers, India-based Raj Aich and his British associate, Soosie Lucas, are studying how cage diving impacts human interaction with the great white shark. Over the past year, the two have interviewed 150 cage divers - the youngest was 12 years old, and the oldest was 70 - from some 20 countries. \"Our research shows divers participating in the study return with a positive attitude towards the sharks after a cage dive,\" Dr Aich says. \"This helps them demystify the great white shark.\" The great white shark has suffered from a crippling image problem ever since the release more than 40 years ago of Steven Spielberg\u0027s Jaws, a horror blockbuster about a shark that repeatedly attacks beachgoers in a resort town in the US. \"It is as if God created the Devil and gave him jaws,\" a voice drones in the trailer about the film\u0027s subject, the most maligned of the 500-odd species of sharks. It is, the narrator says coldly, a \"mindless eating machine\" which \"lives to kill\". Since then generations have grown up with the image of a \"man-eater\" which glides from the sea floor to the surface, searching for human prey to catch and tear apart with its serrated teeth. Decades after Jaws, scary images and stereotypes about the shark are again being perpetuated in rating-thirsty TV shows. Two years ago, a video of a diver escaping an encounter with a great white that smashed through the bars of a diving cage off the coast of Mexico went viral and provoked scary headlines. So much so that the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red list has put the great white on its \u0027vulnerable\u0027 list because of this \"typically exaggerated threat to human safety and almost legendary \u0027Big Fish\u0027 status\". The species, according to IUCN, is targeted as a source of sports-fishing, hunting (for jaws, teeth and even entire specimens preserved), sporadic human consumption or merely as the piscine whipping-boy of individuals pandering to shark attack paranoia\". In real life, the great white shark - the fish can weigh up to two tonnes, grow to lengths of 20ft (6m), reach speeds of 40mph in water and live reasonably long - prefers seals, sea lions, tuna, salmon and small toothed whales as prey. \"They are inquisitive, sharp and sentient beings,\" Dr Aich says. \"Sometimes I go down in the water after baits have been thrown, and the shark doesn\u0027t come to the boat. Or she will come for a few seconds and go away. The shark\u0027s will to encounter humans is pivotal.\" The great white shark, according to shark specialist Craig Ferreira, is also \"capable of explosive violence, but is absolutely not a blood thirsty and aggressive animal, and its behaviour is centred on not becoming involved in conflict and combat, with combat being the last resort.\" Shark attacks have gone down over the years: there were 84 cases of unprovoked attacks on humans in 2016, according to the International Shark Attack File. Between 2011-2016, there were 82 such attacks annually. More than half of the unprovoked attacks took place in the Continental north American waters. Only 13 fatalities have been attributed to great white sharks in Western Australia since 1870, according to Leah Gibbs, a senior lecturer in geography at Australia\u0027s University of Wollongong. Every day, between December and June, two boats ferry hundreds of tourists who pay NZ$500 ($363;£262) each to climb into cages yoked to boats for a view of the undisputed \u0027king of the ocean\u0027 in 12-degree sea water. Attracted by tuna bait, the sharks swim to the turquoise blue waters where the Tasman Sea and the Southern Ocean meet. When the researchers spoke to cage divers near Bluff, many of them reported a \"great white epiphany\". \u0027Calm and peaceful\u0027\nThey found the shark \"calm, peaceful and beautiful\" to look at. Others found it \"inquisitive and curious\". \"It comes and looks at the cage just to see what is going on,\" said one tourist. Watching the great white, according to a 60-year-old Canadian man, was a \"moving experience, and there was no fear at all\". \"People say all scary things about sharks, and as a child you are moulded into certain beliefs. But I felt totally at peace with those animals,\" he said. \"It\u0027s a completely different experience for me than that I\u0027ve seen on TV,\" a honeymooning American couple told the researchers, \"It seems they are much more docile\". The jury is out on whether cage diving is a good way to improve interaction between humans and sharks. Ladling tuna bait in the water to attract the fish creates an \"unnatural situation, leading to unnatural behaviour by the sharks,\", George H Burgess, shark expert at the Florida Museum of Natural History, told me. In New Zealand\u0027s Stewart Island, the country\u0027s third-largest island and another popular shark diving destination, local fishermen have complained about sharks following and attacking boats. In Jaws, Matt Hooper, a character who plays an oceanographer and shark expert, tells the the chief of police investigating the beach deaths, \"There\u0027s nothing in the sea this fish would fear. Other fish run from bigger things. That\u0027s their instinct. But this fish doesn\u0027t run from anything. He doesn\u0027t fear.\" Not quite, as shark divers around the world are beginning to discover.

Free from the main body of the rocket, they spun 180 degrees and arced back towards the earth, burning their engines again as they descended to Cape Canaveral, to land, smoothly, improbably upright, within a second of one other. Meanwhile, the main rocket pushed on, preparing to bring the world an even less credible sight. Four minutes into the flight, the nose cone broke apart to reveal its payload: a cherry-red electric sports car, with the top down, in space - a PR stunt for the ages. It was all brought to you by Elon Musk, the South African-born billionaire entrepreneur and founder of Paypal, electric car company Tesla, and SpaceX, the manufacturer of the Falcon Heavy. The partly-reusable Heavy is the most powerful rocket on earth, and, if Mr Musk is to be believed, a stepping stone to a rocket to Mars. The sports car in the nosecone was one of Mr Musk\u0027s own Tesla Roadsters. Its stereo was programmed to play David Bowie\u0027s Space Oddity on repeat as it travels for millions of years through space. Or until the battery dies, anyway. \"It\u0027s kind of silly and fun,\" he conceded, \"but silly and fun things are important.\" In the 12 years since Mr Musk sold online payments firm Paypal for $1.5bn, he has evolved in the public imagination into a kind of mad genius figure - part industrialist, part scientist, part playboy, part superhero. He has dated and married famous actresses, including Talulah Riley and Amber Heard, and had a rumoured fling with Cameron Diaz. Robert Downey Jr took inspiration from him to play Tony Stark in Iron Man. He has cornered private space flight and the electric car industry, ventured into solar energy and artificial intelligence, and promised super-high speed magnetic train travel, in a tube, underground. Oh, and he plans to colonise Mars. Most take Mr Musk\u0027s more wild ambitions and boasts with a galaxy-sized pinch of salt. His companies have missed deadline after deadline and recorded massive losses. But climate change campaigners have hailed the unexpected popularity of Tesla\u0027s electric cars, and the launch of the Falcon Heavy capped a string of successes for SpaceX. It all began in Pretoria, South Africa. As a young boy, he was obsessed with science fiction novels and more or less anything you could run a current through. His parents, Maye, a model, and Errol, an engineer, separated when he was eight. His younger brother and sister would stay with their mother, so he volunteered to go with their father. It did not go well. He later recalled returning home after vicious bullying at school, \"and it would just be awful there as well\". At 17, he moved to Canada to study physics and economics at Ontario\u0027s Queen\u0027s University. From Canada he migrated to the US in 1992, transferring to the University of Pennsylvania, and from Pennsylvania to a PhD in energy physics at Stanford in California, After two days, he quit. Instead he founded Zip2, an online newspaper platform, with his younger brother Kimbal. In 1999 they sold the company to Compaq for $300m, and Mr Musk ploughed his share into an online bank, X.com. X.com became Paypal, and in 2002 Paypal sold to eBay for $1.5bn. Aged 31, Mr Musk netted $165m. By that time, Mr Musk was two years into a marriage to Justine Wilson, an aspiring fantasy writer he met in Ontario. Mr Musk asked her out for ice cream. She agreed but then blew him off. He showed up in the student centre, where she was studying, with two cups of ice cream. \"He\u0027s not a man who takes no for an answer,\" Ms Wilson recalled in Marie Claire magazine. He is said to be a relentless worker. When he founded Zip2, he reportedly worked all day, slept in the office, and showered over the road at the YMCA. Asked in 2010 what advice he would give entrepreneurs, he suggested they should \"put in 80 to 100-hour weeks every week\". \"If other people are putting in 40-hour work weeks, and you\u0027re putting in 100-hour work weeks, you\u0027ll achieve in four months what takes them a year,\" he said. As they danced at their wedding, Justine later recalled, he told her: \"I am the alpha in this relationship\". He was a controlling husband, she said, pushing her to dye her hair more and more blonde. \"I am your wife,\" she recalled saying, \"not your employee.\" \"If you were my employee,\" he would reply, \"I would fire you.\" Their first son, Nevada, died at 10 weeks from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome - a tragedy that Mr Musk refused to talk about, she said. They went on to have five more children - twins and a set of triplets - via IVF, but she struggled with depression over the death of their first son. Eight years after they married, they divorced, in a messy, multi-million dollar separation. Six weeks later, he texted her to say he was engaged to Talulah Riley, a British actress 14 years his junior. \"I will never be happy without having someone,\" he told Rolling Stone. \"Going to sleep alone kills me.\" He and Ms Riley married in 2010. They divorced in 2012 and remarried in 2013. In 2014 he filed for, then withdrew, a second divorce and in 2016 she filed for divorce and it took. After the sale of Paypal in 2002, Mr Musk ploughed his $165m into three new companies: Tesla, SpaceX, and a solar energy company called Solar City. Tesla was a quixotic venture, a niche electric car company in a nation addicted to gas. With Mr Musk as CEO, the company set out a top-down plan - first, market a high-performance sports car, a machine that would set Tesla apart from a stereotype of small, underpowered electric vehicles. Then a luxury sedan, and finally a low-cost, mass-market electric car. A $456m loan from the US government saved Tesla from near-bankruptcy in 2008, and in 2010 it became the first American car company to float on the stock market since Ford in 1956. In 2017, it surpassed Ford and General Motors to become, briefly, the most valuable car company in the country. It was the market betting on a greener future, and not a reflection of Tesla\u0027s bottom line. Serious production delays on its low-cost Model 3 have compounded years of losses. On Wednesday, the day after its Roadster went interstellar, Tesla Inc landed with a bump. It reported a $675.4m (£487m) loss in the last quarter of 2017, more than five times worse than the previous year, although revenue climbed 44% to $3.3 billion. \"We were in a deeper level of hell than we expected, still a few levels deeper than we would like to be,\" said Mr Musk on a conference call with analysts. It was a characteristic take for a man preoccupied with human extinction. A few hours earlier, he had announced on Twitter that the company\u0027s cosmic Roadster was en route to the asteroid belt, having overshot the trajectory for its planned Mars orbit. Then astronomers took a closer look at the data and concluded the car wouldn\u0027t make it that far. Not for the first time, SpaceX revised its projections. Over the past five or so years, Mr Musk has outlined varying plans and deadlines for his ultimate goal of sending humans to colonise the Red Planet. Late last year, he said he expected SpaceX to send a cargo mission in 2022, to lay groundwork, followed by a manned mission in 2024. The practical difficulties and dangers of sending humans 140 million miles to Mars are huge. Nasa has been more circumspect, putting its estimate for a manned mission somewhere in the mid-2030s. But the successes of SpaceX\u0027s more prosaic work - resupply missions to the space station, commercial satellite launches, Nasa and Air Force contracts - have propelled it to near the top of the list of the world\u0027s most valuable privately-held companies, with a $21.2bn valuation. The company has pioneered new reusable rocket technology, wowing the world, as on Tuesday, with the sight of pencil-like rockets gracefully descending to land with pinpoint accuracy, on land and at sea. It has undercut Nasa and major established rivals such as Boeing to provide (relatively) cheap space flight. And as SpaceX looks to the heavens, another of Mr Musk\u0027s companies is going underground. In October, the Boring Company won permission from the US government to dig a 10-mile test tunnel under Maryland. Mr Musk hopes it will one day house the \"Hyperloop\", an electromagnetic bullet train he has boasted will carry passengers at up to 760mph (1223km/h). In July, he tweeted that he had won \"verbal government approval\" to build a Hyperloop between New York and DC that would reduce the journey time from three hours to 29 minutes. Officials said no such approval had been given. The Hyperloop idea has its fair share of critics. Thom Neff, a civil engineer, put it succinctly when he told Wired last year, \"I would put what Mr Musk is saying today in the bullshit category.\" A working Hyperloop is, without doubt, a long way off. But to those who admire him, Mr Musk is a visionary, an irrepressible Howard Hughes-like figure revolutionising industry after industry. His two latest ventures, Neuralink and OpenAI, take him into the world of artificial intelligence. His madcap ideas to save humanity from itself have even earned him the honour of a parody Twitter account, \"Bored Elon Musk\". On Tuesday, after one of Mr Musk\u0027s companies blasted a sports car into space and another reported record losses, his bored alter-ego put out a single tweet. \"Classic Tuesday,\" it said.
