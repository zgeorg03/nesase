        "content": "A Russian military transport plane has crashed in Syria killing more than 30 people, the defence ministry says. The An-26 plane crashed during landing at Hmeimim airbase, near the coastal city of Latakia, the ministry is quoted as saying by Russian media. It says all 39 military personnel on board died, not 32 as earlier reported. The plane was not fired upon, the ministry says, and preliminary data suggests a technical malfunction could have caused the crash. An investigation is now under way. Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed condolences to the victims' relatives. Meanwhile, medics in the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area of Syria say they have been treating people with breathing problems after a suspected chlorine attack. The reports follow government air strikes and shelling just hours after the last UN aid envoy left the enclave following a supposed five-hour truce. In a separate development, UN war crimes investigators say air strikes in Syria by both Russia and the US-led coalition killed large numbers of civilians last year. What is known about Tuesday's plane crash?\nThe Russian defence ministry says the An-26 crashed at about 15:00 Moscow Time (12:00 GMT). It says the plane went down about 500m (1640ft) from the runway. A special commission is to be set up to investigate the crash. On 7 January, Russian forces said they had foiled a drone attack on Hmeimim. This was just a week after Russian warplanes were damaged at the airbase in a rebel mortar attack. Hmeimim is Russia's main base for air strikes on rebel groups in Syria - strikes that have enabled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces to recover much lost ground. What are Russia's air force losses in Syria?\nRussia launched its military operation in September 2015, saying it was acting upon a request by President Assad. Here are the confirmed air force losses: What about the suspected chlorine attack in Eastern Ghouta?\nThe attack targeted the town of Hammoria and led to the evacuation of dozens of civilians, according to the Syrian Civil Defence, whose volunteer rescue workers are widely known as the White Helmets. Local medics said they were treating a number of people who had breathing problems. Syria denied allegations it had carried out the attack, dismissing them as an act of desperation by Western powers. Meanwhile, Russia - a key ally of the Syrian government - offered rebels safe passage out of the area. What did UN war crimes investigators say?\nThey said they found that an attack by the US-coalition on a school near the city of Raqqa last March killed 150 local residents - many times more than Washington had admitted to. The investigators also said Russian air strikes on a market in Atareb, west of Aleppo, killed at least 84 people last November. Their report talked too of chemical weapons attacks by Syrian government forces, and war crimes allegedly committed by their rebel opponents. ",

        "content": "North Korea is willing to talk about getting rid of its nuclear weapons but only if its own safety can be guaranteed, South Korea says. The South says the subject was raised when its officials met with the North's leader, Kim Jong-un, in Pyongyang on Monday, during a rare visit. They said Mr Kim is also open to US talks, and would pause weapons testing. In previous programmes to halt its nuclear ambitions, the North has failed to keep its promises. The leaders of North and South Korea have also agreed to meet at a summit next month, Seoul's envoy says. It will be the first such meeting for more than a decade and the first since Kim Jong-un took power in North Korea. Mr Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in will meet on the heavily fortified border next month, at the truce village of Panmunjom. The countries also agreed to open a hotline between the leaders. Throughout February's Winter Olympics in South Korea, the two countries struck a friendly tone, sending athletes to compete in a joint team and holding talks. But the US maintained that North Korean gestures of rapprochement would carry little weight without a commitment on nuclear weapons - particularly following last year's nuclear and missile tests carried out by the North. The South Korean delegation is expected to visit Washington later this week to brief US officials on their talks in the North. What is North Korea reported to have said?\nA statement from the South Korea president's office said: \"The North showed willingness on denuclearisation in the Korean Peninsula. If military threats to the North Korea decrease and regime safety is guaranteed, the North showed that it has no reason to retain nukes.\" The North's KCNA news agency said Mr Kim had \"warmly welcomed\" the delegates and held an \"openhearted talk\" with them. It said the dinner took place \"in a warm atmosphere overflowing with compatriotic feelings\". However, some critics have suspicions over North Korea's intentions. In the past, they have failed to follow through on deals, notably an aid-for-disarmament agreement in 2005. Where does the US stand?\nThe United States has said it will only go in to formal talks with North Korea if Pyongyang is ready to give up its nuclear weapons. After the news from the South Korean officials was made public, President Donald Trump tweeted: \"The World is watching and waiting!\" \"May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!\" Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction! End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump Vice-President Mike Pence added: \"All options are on the table and our posture toward the regime will not change until we see credible, verifiable, and concrete steps toward denuclearization.\" Meanwhile, China's foreign ministry said it hopes the Koreas can continue with efforts to advance reconciliation, Reuters news agency reported. What next?\nAnalysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence correspondent This is, of course, South Korea's take on what North Korea is offering. Some of the suggestions are, at face value, encouraging - not least North Korea's apparent willingness to discuss the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. However, its conditions - that the military threat to North Korea is reduced and regime safety is guaranteed - raise all sorts of questions. The North also says that it is willing to talk to the US with the goal of normalising relations with Washington. The most positive element is the most immediate; that the period of calm initiated by the Winter Olympics looks set to continue. \"While the dialogues continue,\" the South says, \"the North will not conduct any nuclear tests, missile launches or other provocations.\" (Surely not Pyongyang's words!) The two Koreas appear willing to create diplomatic space to try to improve relations across the board. Much will now depend upon how Washington reacts. What happened at the Pyongyang dinner?\nSouth Korean officials had a four-hour dinner with Kim Jong-un on Monday. Among the delegation were intelligence chief Suh Hoon and National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong. Pictures showed Mr Kim and visitors from the South smiling broadly around a dinner table. Also present was Mr Kim's wife, Ri Sol-ju, who rarely appears at official events, and his sister Kim Yo-jong, who was part of a North Korean delegation to the Pyeongchang Olympics. The two sides appear to be aiming to capitalise on the reduced tensions after the Games, which saw the Koreas march together under one flag. During their visit, the South's officials also held a boardroom meeting and passed on a letter from South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in which he invited Mr Kim to attend further talks. KCNA said Mr Kim had \"exchanged views and made a satisfactory agreement\" on the letter and gave orders for it to be acted on. The South's delegates returned to Seoul on Tuesday morning, the South Korean news agency Yonhap said. Has this ever happened before?\nThese were the first officials from Seoul to meet Mr Kim since he came to power. Kim Jong-un has met very few foreign officials since he became leader in 2011 and the last time envoys from the South visited Pyongyang was in 2007. Two previous summits were held in 2000 and 2007, under South Korean presidents Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun who met Kim's father, Kim Jong-il. The South's officials have stressed the talks were only preliminary, but the parties had \"somewhat shared\" views on some issues. ",

        "content": "A Perth family has found the world's oldest known message in a bottle, almost 132 years after it was thrown into the sea, Australian experts say. Tonya Illman picked up the bottle while going for a walk around sand dunes on a remote beach in West Australia. Her husband Kym Illman told the BBC they found some paper in the bottle but had \"no idea\" what it was until they took it home and dried it in the oven. Experts have confirmed it is an authentic message from a German ship. The note in the bottle, which was dated 12 June 1886, was jettisoned from the German ship Paula, as part of an experiment into ocean and shipping routes by the German Naval Observatory. Previously, the Guinness world record for the oldest message in a bottle was 108 years, between it being sent and found. 'Rolled up cigarette'\nThe Illman family were driving through a beach north of Wedge Island on 21 January when the car became bogged down in the sand, and Mrs Illman and her friend decided to go for a walk. \"Tonya saw a whole lot of rubbish on the ground, and thought she'd help pick up some rubbish,\" Mr Illman told the BBC. She found and picked up the bottle, thinking it would be nice for her bookshelf, he added. Mr Illman said his wife passed the bottle \"to our son's girlfriend, who saw what she thought was a rolled-up cigarette, and tipped it out with the sand\". \"Tonya tried to untie the string around the paper, but it was rather fragile, so we took it home and put it in the oven for five minutes to dry up the moisture. \"Then we unrolled it and saw printed writing. We could not see the hand written ink at that point, but saw a printed message that asked the reader to contact the German consulate when they found the note.\" Later, they also noticed faint handwriting on the note, with a date of 12 June 1886 and the name of the ship, Paula. When they saw the date they thought it was \"too far-fetched\" to be real, Mr Illman said - but they researched the bottle online and took it to experts at the Western Australian Museum. Dr Ross Anderson, Assistant Curator Maritime Archaeology at the WA Museum, confirmed the find was authentic after consulting with colleagues from Germany and the Netherlands. \"Incredibly, an archival search in Germany found Paula's original Meteorological Journal and there was an entry for 12 June 1886 made by the captain, recording a drift bottle having been thrown overboard. The date and the coordinates correspond exactly with those on the bottle message,\" Dr Anderson said. The handwriting on the journal, and the message in the bottle, also matched, he added. The bottle was jettisoned in the south-eastern Indian Ocean while the ship was travelling from Cardiff in Wales to Indonesia, and probably washed up on the Australian coast within 12 months, where it was buried under the sand, he wrote in his report. Thousands of bottles were thrown overboard during the 69-year German experiment but to date only 662 messages - and no bottles - had been returned. The last bottle with a note to be found was in Denmark in 1934. The bottle found on Wedge Island was found \"mostly exposed without any form of cork or closure, and was about a quarter full of damp sand\", and the bottle appeared to have lain \"buried or mostly buried\", partially filled with damp sand, Dr Anderson added. Sand dunes in the area are quite mobile during storm events and heavy rain, so the bottle could have been subject to \"cyclical periods of exposure\" which could have led to the cork in the bottle drying out and becoming dislodged, \"while the tightly rolled paper along with a quantity of sand remained inside preserved\". \"The narrow 7mm bore of the bottle opening and thick glass would have assisted to buffer and preserve the paper from the effects of full exposure to the elements, providing a protective microenvironment favourable to the paper's long-term preservation,\" the report added. You might also like\nThe Illman family have loaned the find to the Western Australian Museum for the next two years, and it will be on display to the public from Wednesday. WA Minister for Culture and the Arts David Templeman said he was \"delighted\" with the loan, adding: \"It is truly an impressive find and thanks to the wonderful international and interdisciplinary cooperation of science and research, it can now also be shared with the world.\" Writing online, Mrs Illman described the find as \"the most remarkable event in my life\". \"To think that this bottle has not been touched for nearly 132 years and is in perfect condition, despite the elements, beggars belief. I'm still shaking.\" Reporting by the BBC's Helier Cheung. ",

        "content": "The UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian involvement in the collapse of former spy Sergei Skripal, Boris Johnson has said. Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are critically ill in hospital after being found unconscious in Salisbury, Wiltshire. The foreign secretary said he was not pointing fingers at this stage, but described Russia as \"a malign and disruptive force\". Russia has denied any involvement. Counter Terrorism Police have taken over the investigation from Wiltshire Police. But in a statement, the unit said the inquiry had not been declared a terrorist incident and there was no risk to the wider public. Family deaths\nMr Skripal's relatives have told the BBC Russian Service that the former spy believed the Russian special services might come after him at any time. His wife, elder brother and his son have died in the past two years, some in mysterious circumstances, the family believe. Ms Skripal is based in Moscow and has visited her father in the UK regularly, especially over the past two years. Mr Skripal - a former Russian agent convicted of spying for Britain - and his daughter were found slumped on a bench outside a shopping centre on Sunday afternoon. Before that, they had been seen walking through an alley leading from a Zizzi restaurant, which has now been \"secured\" by police. The Bishop's Mill pub has also been cordoned off as a precaution. Scientists at Porton Down - the UK's secret weapons research facility in Wiltshire - are studying the \"unknown substance\" that is thought to have made the pair ill. Mr Johnson told MPs: \"Honourable members will note the echoes of the death of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006. \"I say to governments around the world that no attempt to take innocent life on UK soil will go unsanctioned or unpunished.\" Mr Johnson said that if it emerged Russia was linked to the incident in Salisbury \"it would be very difficult to imagine\" that UK representation at this summer's football World Cup could go ahead in the \"normal way\". Aides to Mr Johnson say he was referring to \"officials\" - and not the England team. You may also be interested in:\nMr Johnson said the UK was \"in the lead across the world\" in trying to counteract a \"host of malign activity\" by Russia. In a statement, the Russian embassy in London said: \"Media reports create an impression of a planned operation by the Russian special services, which is completely untrue.\" Responding to Mr Johnson's comments, the Russian embassy added: \"We regret that instead of a proper official clarification on the issue the Foreign Secretary chose to threaten Russia with retribution. \"Looks like the script of yet another anti-Russian campaign has been already written.\" Analysis\nBy Norman Smith, BBC assistant political editor Although Boris Johnson was careful to stress this was still an ongoing investigation - it's absolutely clear he, and others in government, believe it's highly likely this was a Russian state-sponsored attack. The big question now - how does the government respond? A question made more pressing by accusations that ministers were guilty of appeasement in the wake of Alexander Litvinenko's killing. Mr Johnson suggested there could be targeted sanctions against those close to President Putin. And, perhaps most significantly, in an indication the government could seek to rally international support to make a stand against Russia, Mr Johnson said there could be a co-ordinated response with Nato allies. Whatever measures are eventually decided upon - if Russian involvement is proven - it's clear relations between London and Moscow have plunged to new depths. Andrei Lugovoi, the former Russian agent accused of poisoning ex-spy Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006, told the BBC that Russia would have considered the matter closed when Mr Skripal was flown to the UK as part of a spy swap in 2010. Mr Skripal was pardoned by the Russian President and so the incident was over, Mr Lugovoi said. Igor Sutyagin, who was one of four agents released by Moscow in the exchange, is now a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). He told the BBC's World Tonight programme that he was not yet concerned for his safety and added: \"I don't think that he (Mr Skripal) would be targeted, because he was pardoned.\" Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, but says it is open to co-operating with British police if requested. Police are currently examining CCTV footage, filmed by a Salisbury gym, showing an unidentified man and woman - thought to be Mr Skripal and his daughter - walking near the location where they were found. Wiltshire Police has said two officers caught up in the suspected contamination have been treated in hospital for minor symptoms, before they were given the all clear. It is understood their symptoms included itchy eyes and wheezing. A third member of the emergency services remains in hospital. In Salisbury, some residents have told the BBC of their surprise at the incident happening in the small city, while others are seemingly unruffled. \"I'm not nervous for my own safety,\" says Sue Doe, smoking a cigarette a stone's throw from Zizzi's. \"I'm just interested to know what's happened.\" Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI as part of a swap. He was later flown to the UK. According to BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban, in recent years Col Skripal gave lectures at military academies offering insight into Russia's foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU. Read more about Sergei Skripal's background here. Putin, power and poison: Russia\u2019s elite FSB spy club The possibility of an unexplained substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko. The Russian dissident and former intelligence officer died in London after drinking tea laced with a radioactive substance. A public inquiry concluded that his killing had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Mr Litvinenko's widow, Marina Litvinenko, told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight that the latest incident felt like \"deja vu\" - and called for those receiving political asylum to be protected by the UK.

Police found the woman, in her 40s, at the family home in Twickenham, south-west London, shortly before 18:00 GMT on Monday. Her death is being treated as murder. Sussex Police were called after three bodies - thought to be the woman's sons, aged seven and 10, and husband, 57 - were found at Birling Gap beach. Scotland Yard said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths. Detectives were called to South Road in Twickenham after concerns were raised for the welfare of the occupants. Post-mortem examinations will take place in due course, they said. Sussex Police said it recovered a vehicle near to where the three bodies were found at about 17:00 on Monday. The house in Twickenham has been sealed off as forensic officers carry out their investigations. One neighbour, Alicia Mede, said she believed the family were new to the area but had seen little of them. \"I saw Christmas lights on around Christmas time, but that was it,\" she said. ",

        "content": "A lorry driver has been convicted of causing the deaths of eight people in a crash on the M1. Ryszard Masierak, 31, was at twice the drink-drive limit and had stopped in the inside lane when he was involved in the crash with a minibus and another lorry near Newport Pagnell. He was found guilty of eight counts of causing death by dangerous driving. The jury at Reading Crown Court is still deliberating charges against the other lorry driver, David Wagstaff. Masierak was also convicted of four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving after the crash last August. Wagstaff, 54, of Derwent Street, Stoke-on-Trent, denies the same charges. The trial heard Masierak's vehicle was stopped in the carriageway for about 12 minutes - an act described by prosecutor Oliver Saxby QC as \"as flagrant as it was dangerous\". The eight people killed were all travelling in the minibus, which was carrying 11 Indian tourists from Nottingham to London ahead of a trip to Disneyland Paris. The six men and two women were driver Cyriac Joseph, Panneerselvam Annamalai, Rishi Ranjeev Kumar, Vivek Baskaran, Lavanyalakshmi Seetharaman, Karthikeyan Pugalur Ramasubramanian, Subramaniyan Arachelvan and Tamilmani Arachelvan. Four other passengers - including a four-year-old girl orphaned by the crash - spent weeks in hospital afterwards. The court was told AIM Logistics driver Masierak, a Polish national, stopped in the carriageway at about 02:57 BST, despite there being miles of hard shoulder available. He admitted he had consumed alcohol. He told the court he stopped because he was sweating, felt weak and had a headache and had attempted to get onto the hard shoulder. Masierak, of Barnards Close, Evesham, Worcestershire, then said he lost consciousness, only to be woken from what he described as a \"small coma\" when the crash happened. Wagstaff has been released on continuing bail. ",

        "content": "Medics in the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area of Syria say they have been treating people with breathing problems after a suspected chlorine attack. The reports follow government air strikes and shelling just hours after the last UN aid envoy left the enclave following a supposed five-hour truce. Syria denied allegations it had carried out the attack, dismissing them as an act of desperation by Western powers. Russia meanwhile has offered rebels safe passage out of the area. The latest suspected chemical attack targeted the town of Hammoria and led to the evacuation of dozens of civilians, according to the Syrian Civil Defence, whose volunteer rescue workers are widely known as the White Helmets. The group tweeted that \"more 30 suffocation cases\", including women and children, were reported following what it described as a \"regime gas attack\". The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) monitoring group, which uses a network of sources on the ground, said it could not specify the cause of the illnesses. Syrian state media suggested the attack had been staged amid \"desperate attempts by some Western countries in the [UN] Security Council and the Human Rights Council to rescue terrorists who will face their inevitable end at the hands of the Syrian Arab Army\". The UN Human Rights Council has ordered an investigation into the recent violence, and has already condemned the alleged use of chemical weapons. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has dismissed dire assessments of the humanitarian situation in the enclave as \"ridiculous lies\". On Tuesday, the Russian military said in a statement that its forces would provide transport and security for the rebels and their families looking to leave the besieged enclave. The offer, which would allow rebels with personal weapons through a secure corridor, could pave the way for a deal by which the opposition would surrender its last major stronghold near Damascus to Mr Assad. A spokesman for one of the dominant rebel groups in Eastern Ghouta, Faylaq al-Rahman, accused Russia - Syria's key ally - of military escalation and of trying to displace the population by force. On Monday, 94 civilians were killed amid Syrian government air strikes in Eastern Ghouta, despite a supposed five-hour truce, according to the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM), which operates medical facilities there. A UN convoy delivering the first aid since February to the town of Douma was forced to cut short its mission and left after nearly nine hours amid shelling. The UN's refugee agency said 10 out of more than 40 trucks had not been emptied. The Syrian Red Crescent earlier said 46 truckloads of food parcels were delivered to 27,500 people, along with health items for more than 70,000 people in Douma. More than 700 people have been killed in violence in Eastern Ghouta since the government intensified its offensive in recent weeks, many of them children. Several reports suggest government forces are attempting to cut the region - home to about 393,000 people - in two. ",

        "content": "Myanmar has not stopped its ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya people in Rakhine state, a United Nations human rights official said on Tuesday. The UN envoy's assessment of a continued \"campaign of terror and forced starvation\" comes six months after a military crackdown caused a mass exodus of Rohingya Muslims. Some 700,000 people have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh since August. They have since told of murder, rape and arson by soldiers and vigilantes. Myanmar's military says it is fighting Rohingya militants and denies targeting civilians in Rakhine state. \"The ethnic cleansing of Rohingya from Myanmar continues,\" said the UN's assistant secretary-general for human rights, Andrew Gilmour. \"I don't think we can draw any other conclusion from what I have seen and heard in Cox's Bazar,\" he added, referring to a district in southern Bangladesh which is home to most of the refugees. \"The nature of the violence has changed from the frenzied blood-letting and mass rape of last year to a lower intensity campaign of terror and forced starvation,\" Mr Gilmour said after speaking with recently arrived Rohingya in packed refugee camps, according to AFP. Bangladesh and Myanmar authorities had been in talks over repatriating refugees in the coming months but a build up of Myanmar military on the border last week sparked concern. The UN envoy said it was \"inconceivable\" for any Rohingya to return to Rakhine state in the near future in a \"safe, dignified and sustainable\" way. \"The government of Myanmar is busy telling the world that it is ready to receive Rohingya returnees, while at the same time its forces are continuing to drive them into Bangladesh,\" Mr Gilmour said. Safety in the sewage\nBy Anbarasan Ethirajan, Balukhali refugee camp, near Cox's Bazar In the months since they arrived, most of the 700,000 Rohingya refugees now appear to be in camps with a roof over their heads and food provided by aid agencies. They are no longer living on roadsides or in the jungle. But a walk through Balukhali, one of the largest refugee camps in the world, is a staggering and intense experience. More than 300,000 men, women and children are cramped in shacks made of bamboo and plastic sheeting. There are rivulets of sewage running through the camps. Most of the shacks are sitting precariously on hill terraces. I could see dozens of men, women and even children carrying their weekly food rations. The refugees may feel safer, but the real challenge will start once the monsoon begins in a couple of months. ",

        "content": "The wreck of a US aircraft carrier that was sunk during World War Two has been found off the coast of Australia. The USS Lexington was found 3km (2 miles) underwater in the Coral Sea, about 800km off Australia's east coast. The ship was lost in the Battle of the Coral Sea, fought with Japan from 4-8 May 1942. More than 200 crew members died in the fighting. The US Navy confirmed the ship had been discovered by a search team led by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. Pictures showed the wreck to be well preserved. The discovery of the Lexington, along with 11 of its 35 aircraft, was made by Mr Allen's company Vulcan on Sunday. An exciting announcement regarding USS Lexington (CV-2)! Though Lexington was lost in the Battle of the Coral Sea, the valiant efforts of her men crippled IJN carriers Sh\u014dkaku and Zuikaku so that they were unable to take part at Midway, setting the stage for an Allied victory. https://t.co/KaAPsOtRqO End of Twitter post by @PacificCommand Adm Harry Harris, head of the US Pacific Command, praised the discovery. \"As the son of a survivor of the USS Lexington, I offer my congratulations to Paul Allen and the expedition crew of Research Vessel (R/V) Petrel for locating the 'Lady Lex',\" he said on Tuesday. The Battle of the Coral Sea is considered a key moment in halting Japan's advance in the Pacific during the war. The Lexington was scuttled by US forces after being struck by several Japanese torpedoes and bombs during the battle. The US Navy said 216 crew members died after the ship was attacked. More than 2,000 others were rescued. \"Lexington was on our priority list because she was one of the capital ships that was lost during WWII,\" Vulcan spokesman Robert Kraft said. Pictures from the seabed taken by the Petrel show the Lexington's nameplate and guns. Some of the ship's aircraft are also shown in remarkably good condition. The ship will not be retrieved because the US Navy considers it to be a war grave. Mr Kraft said it had taken about six months of planning to locate the ship. Last year, Vulcan discovered the wreck of the USS Indianapolis, which sank in July 1945. It has found other vessels including a Japanese warship, the Musashi, and an Italian naval vessel, Artigliere - both from the same era. ",

        "content": "Four dementia scientists have shared this year's 1m Euro brain prize for pivotal work that has changed our understanding of Alzheimer's disease. Profs John Hardy, Bart De Strooper, Michael Goedert, based in the UK, and Prof Christian Haass, from Germany, unpicked key protein changes that lead to this most common type of dementia. On getting the award, Prof Hardy said he hoped new treatments could be found. He is donating some of his prize money to care for Alzheimer's patients. Much of the drug discovery research that's done today builds on their pioneering work, looking for ways to stop the build-up of damaging proteins, such as amyloid and tau. Alzheimer's and other dementias affect 50 million people around the world, and none of the treatments currently available can stop the disease. Path to beating Alzheimer's\nProf Hardy's work includes finding rare, faulty genes linked to Alzheimer's disease. These genetic errors implicated a build-up of amyloid as the event that kick-starts damage to nerve cells in Alzheimer's. This idea, known as the amyloid cascade hypothesis, has been central to Alzheimer's research for nearly 30 years. Together with Prof Haass, who is from the University of Munich, Prof Hardy, who's now at University College London, then discovered how amyloid production changes in people with rare inherited forms of Alzheimer's dementia. How one woman and her family transformed Alzheimer's research Prof Goedert's research at Cambridge University, meanwhile, revealed the importance of another damaging protein, called tau, while Prof De Stooper, who is the new director of the UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL, discovered how genetic errors that alter the activity of proteins called secretases can lead to Alzheimer's processes. Dr David Reynolds, Chief Scientific Officer at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \"Our congratulations go to all four of these outstanding scientists whose vital contributions have transformed our understanding of the complex causes of Alzheimer's disease. \"The fact that three of these researchers work in the UK reflects the country's position as a global leader in dementia research.\" Prof Hardy said he would be donating around 5,000 euros of his share of the 1m euros from the Lundbeck Foundation to help campaigns to keep Britain in the EU, and called Brexit a \"unmitigated disaster\" for scientific research. He also pledged his thanks to all the people with Alzheimer's who, over the years, have volunteered to help with dementia research. ",

        "content": "Florida lawmakers have voted to enact new gun control measures, weeks after one of the worst school shootings in US history took place in the state. The Senate narrowly passed a bill that would raise the age to buy a firearm from 18 to 21 and require a three-day waiting period for most weapons. Senators voted 20-18 in favour, after an amendment removed a provision to arm classroom teachers. The law now requires approval from the House of Representatives and governor. Seventeen people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the Florida city of Parkland on 14 February by former student Nikolas Cruz. Many of the surviving students had called on politicians do more than give \"thoughts and prayers\" and protested for greater gun control. Emotional testimony\nThe national minimum age to buy a handgun is already 21. Florida law mandates a three-day waiting period before the purchase of a handgun is completed. However, a person as young as 18 can buy a rifle in Florida, with no waiting period. Mr Cruz was 18 years old when he purchased the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle he turned on students and school staff, authorities said according to Reuters. Senators listened to three hours of often emotional testimony before voting. \"Do I think this bill goes far enough? No! No, I don't!\" Democratic Senator Lauren Book told the AP news agency. She said she hoped for a ban on assault weapons, but the Senate had already rejected the provision at the weekend. Armed 'marshals' in schools\nUnder the bill, classroom teachers have been exempted from a new voluntary armed \"marshals\" programme for schools in Florida. The programme - named after Aaron Feis, a coach who died in the Parkland shooting - will allow school staff who do not teach in classrooms to be armed, subject to school district approval and specialist training. The exemption of classroom teachers was deemed necessary to get the bill passed. Republican Governor Rick Scott - who has the final say on the bill - has opposed arming teachers. Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School parents and students had also decried the proposal. A ban on the sale or possession of bump fire stocks - a piece of metal or plastic that allows a semi-automatic weapon to fire rounds of bullets in seconds, much like a machine gun - was also approved. The new bill represents a break with the National Rifle Association (NRA), which has resisted proposals to raise age limits or impose new waiting limits. In the past few weeks, a number of companies have cut ties with the gun rights lobby by ending discounts for NRA members. Meanwhile, Oregon Governor Kate Brown signed into law on Monday a bill to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and people under restraining orders - a measure which the state touted as the first bill to pass since the Parkland massacre.

        "content": "France plans to fix the legal age of sexual consent as 15, meaning sex with someone younger than that would be considered rape. Equality Minister Marl\u00e8ne Schiappa welcomed the move, which follows advice from doctors and legal experts. Currently, prosecutors must prove sex with someone under 15 was forced in order to bring rape charges. The change comes amid uproar over two recent cases of men accused of having sex with 11-year-old girls. Under the existing legislation, if there is no violence or coercion proved, offenders may only be charged with sexual abuse of a minor and not rape. This has a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of \u20ac75,000 (\u00a366,000; $87,000). Sentences are the same for sexual assaults of minors and non-minors, but rape convictions carry much harsher punishments. The government is to approve the new age limit as part of a package of other laws against sexual violence and harassment in the coming weeks. It had been discussing whether to set the age as 13 or 15, which is what groups fighting violence against children had campaigned for. Ms Schiappa told AFP news agency that she was \"very glad\" that the higher age was chosen. The limit is also supported by President Emmanuel Macron. Minister of Solidarity and Health Agn\u00e8s Buzyn said setting a legal age of sexual consent would allow a \"collective awareness\" and that everyone would see what was \"legal and illegal\", Le Figaro newspaper reports (in French). Last November, a 30-year-old man was acquitted of rape after a court determined his 11-year-old victim had not been subjected to \"constraint, threat, violence or surprise\". In another case, a court initially said a 28-year-old man should face charges of sexual assault, and not rape, after saying the victim was not physically forced to have sex. But the same court reversed its decision last month, saying the accused should indeed face rape charges. Legislation varies across Europe, with countries setting different legal ages of consent: In the UK the age of sexual consent is 16, but children under the age of 13 have additional legal protections that declare they can never consent to sexual activity.

        "content": "A professional rugby player, Tasered six times after driving at 150mph in a police chase, has been jailed. Scott Moore crashed into a house in Leigh and fought officers, threatening one with a Taser he stole from them. The ex-England rugby league star, 30, used \"his size and experience on the rugby field\" to evade arrest, Greater Manchester Police said. He was jailed for 23 months at Bolton Crown Court after admitting dangerous driving and assault. Moore, of Ranworth Drive, Lowton, Wigan, was disqualified from driving for two years. Police spotted Moore in the early hours of 14 October 2016 driving a black Mercedes at speed along Chaddock Lane towards the East Lancashire Road. He refused to pull over, sparking a pursuit during which he overtook a lorry at 100mph on a stretch of roadworks which had a speed limit of 30mph. He then accelerated at more than 150mph into a housing estate in Leigh and crashed into the wall of a house before stopping at a dead end, police said. 'Tug of war'\nMoore elbowed an officer and \"violently resisted arrest in a struggle lasting 50 minutes\" during which he was Tasered six times but \"kept rising to his feet to fight and charge at officers\". At one point, the former St Helens, Widnes and Wakefield hooker grabbed the Taser's wires after being stunned and removed them from his body. He then grabbed the Taser in a \"tug of war\" with the officer, shouting: \"You're getting it now!\" while pointing it at the officer's face, police said. The terrified officer fought with Moore to release it from his hand and the other officer struck him numerous times. Moore eventually dropped the Taser and, following a further struggle, was detained. The officers had never in their careers \"been so scared nor witnessed such a violent individual\", Det Con Lynsey Watson-Perry said. One officer had to undergo surgery. \"Whatever level of force he is used to displaying on the pitch, this was not a game - people's lives were in danger\", she added. ",

        "content": "Sri Lanka has declared a state of emergency after several attacks against mosques and Muslim-owned businesses. A curfew is in place in the central district of Kandy, where crowds from the Buddhist Sinhala majority attacked a mosque, Muslim-owned shops and homes. The authorities fear retaliation after a young Muslim man's body was found in a burnt-out building on Tuesday. Tensions flared after the death of a Buddhist man who was said to have been beaten by some Muslims a week ago. Last week, the eastern town of Ampara also saw anti-Muslim violence over a dispute in a shop. A police curfew was declared in Kandy on Monday to prevent more sectarian clashes after the attacks carried out by a large Sinhala mob. It was briefly lifted on Tuesday, but soon re-imposed after the body of a 24-year-old Muslim man was found in the town of Digana. \"Four mosques, 37 houses, 46 shops and 35 vehicles damaged in Digana and Teldeniya area due to the mob attack,\" a local official told the BBC. \"Everything is destroyed. Muslims live in fear,\" he said. Tension has been on the rise in Sri Lanka since 2012, said to have been fuelled by hardline Buddhists. Under the state of emergency, the authorities are able to arrest and detain suspects for long periods, and deploy forces where needed. They will also take action against \"hate speech posts\" on social media, a cabinet spokesman told the BBC. It is the first time in seven years Sri Lanka has imposed the measure. The country was under a state of emergency for nearly three decades when the government fought Tamil rebels in the civil war that ended in 2009. ",

        "content": "The parents of a seriously ill toddler have lost their appeal against a High Court decision to end his life support. A judge ruled last month that doctors at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool can stop treating 21-month-old Alfie Evans against the wishes of his parents Kate James and Tom Evans. They want to take him abroad for treatment for his mystery illness but doctors said it would be \"futile\". Judges at London's Court of Appeal said they could appeal at the Supreme Court. Alfie's parents, from Bootle, Merseyside, were not at the hearing in London but Mr Evans said afterwards he would challenge the decision at the Supreme Court. He said: \"Some people might think why didn't they just end it there? \"But how can you end it when you've got a two-year-old boy who's fighting as hard as you could ever picture him. \"At this moment, Alfie's not ready so we're not ready to let go.\" Alfie is in a \"semi-vegetative state\" and has an undiagnosed degenerative neurological condition. Announcing the decision at the Court of Appeal, Mrs Justice King said Alfie's parents were \"unable to accept what movements in Alfie they see are not positive responses\". Medical evidence showed that Alfie was \"deeply comatose\" and \"to all intents and purposes unaware of his surroundings\", she said. 'No clear plan'\nMrs Justice King said Alfie's father wanted to move him to a hospital in Rome then, if necessary, to a hospital in Munich. She added he was passionate and wanted to \"fight on with Alfie's Army\" but she said he had \"no clear plan\". Alder Hey Children's Hospital said in a statement: \"Today the Court of Appeal upheld the judgement from the High Court that continued active treatment is not in Alfie's best interest. \"We understand that this is a very difficult time for Alfie's family and we will continue to work with them to agree the most appropriate palliative care plan for Alfie.\" Mr Justice Anthony Hayden said following a hearing at Liverpool Civil and Family Court he accepted medical evidence that showed further treatment was \"futile\" and gave doctors permission to provide palliative care only for Alfie. The hospital was set to withdraw ventilation on 23 February before his parents challenged the decision. Mrs Justice King said Mr Justice Hayden had considered all evidence presented to him and he \"could not have done more to ensure father and mother had every opportunity to express their views and have them taken into consideration\". She said his approach had been gentle and he could not have given the couple greater respect. But she said the best interests of the child had to prevail. She added he had been \"meticulous and thorough\" and had weighed all arguments raised. 'Death penalty'\nBarrister Stephen Knafler QC, who is leading Alfie's parents' legal team, had said \"the state\" had wrongly interfered with \"parental choice\". He said Alfie's parents wanted to move him to the Vatican-linked Bambino Gesu Paediatric Hospital in Rome but Mr Justice Hayden's ruling had prevented them from doing that. Alfie's parents have until 16:00 GMT on Thursday to put a formal request to appeal the Court of Appeal's decision. An appeal by the parents of Isaiah Haastrup - a severely disabled boy at the centre of a life-support treatment dispute in London - has been dismissed at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France.

        "content": "The world's last surviving male northern white rhino has rallied slightly, days after his carers said his future was \"not looking bright\". Sudan, who lives at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, enjoyed a mud bath in the rain on Monday, a spokesman told the BBC. However, they were still not holding out \"big hopes\" for a miracle recovery. The 45-year-old is one of just three remaining northern white rhinos and is the only male. Attempts to mate him with the two surviving female rhinos failed, however, and an account was created for him on the dating app Tinder last year, not to find love, but to help fund the development of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) for rhinos. The move won him fans across the world - many of whom were devastated on hearing news of his \"ailing condition\" last Thursday. Today is #WorldWildlifeDay, and we have been overwhelmed by the messages of concern, touching tributes and well wishes for Sudan. It has been a tough couple of days for us here at Ol Pejeta but your encouragement has kept us (and Sudan) going. pic.twitter.com/nVltnEK19e End of Twitter post by @OlPejeta Ol Pejeta's Elodie Sampere, told the BBC the rhino - who is the equivalent of 90 in human years, according to the reserve - had been suffering from bedsores as his mobility decreased, one of which had become infected. \"We are treating his wounds twice a day to avoid the risk of infection and they're getting better,\" she said on Tuesday. \"The sores are being made worse because he lies down too much.\" The reserve, which has been caring for Sudan and his two female companions since 2009, keeping them under 24-hour armed guard to protect them from poachers, has accepted the rhino will not be with them much longer. He had only recovered in the last few months from an infection which took hold late last year. However, they have been encouraged by Sudan's \"lifted spirits\" in the last few days. It\u2019s been raining heavily on Ol Pejeta for the past couple of days and the weather certainly seems to have lifted Sudan\u2019s spirits. He has been able to wallow in the mud - with the careful assistance of his caregivers \u2013 something that he seems to savour. pic.twitter.com/B0bhaIL7GN End of Twitter post 2 by @OlPejeta Sudan was retired from his role as a potential mate four years ago. But conservationists hope this does not mean the end for the northern white rhino. The two female rhinos - Najin and Fatu - are far younger, and progress with IVF may mean they are one day able to have their own calves. ",

Pink IPA - a spoof of their beer Punk IPA - has a pink label and will be sold to women for a lower price than men. The brewer says it's a sarcastic way to address the gender pay gap and have a dig at \"lazy\" marketing campaigns. Some have criticised BrewDog's joke while others have praised them for donating some of their profits to women's charities. We\u2019ve created a beer for girls. And it\u2019s pink.

You have lots of supportive shareholders who are female scientists & engineers. They could have been involved, collaborated and a simple engagement with those supporters could have given you a much stronger campaign End of Twitter post by @hapsci I really appreciate the sentiment, but I'm a little confused by this marketing strategy.... End of Twitter post by @SciencyCheese The brewer launched the beer ahead of International Women's Day on Thursday 8 March. As part of the campaign for the next four weeks, people who \"identify as female\" will be able to pick up Pink IPA in any BrewDog bar for 20% less. Oh dear! Really?!? pic.twitter.com/8RSVkHEp48 End of Twitter post by @bagpuss_mcd And responding to the gender pay gap, 20% of the proceeds from Pink IPA and Punk IPA will be donated to charities that fight inequality and support women. There was some defence for the brewer. To be fair, it was always going to be perceived as wrong by somebody. Especially on Twitter. It doesn\u2019t take much. End of Twitter post by @sjbdesign1 Others thought the best way to respond was with more #sarcasm. Well at least the beer within will be the best IPA in Britain.#sarcasm End of Twitter post by @LucyCorne BrewDog's global head of marketing Sarah Warman said: \"The fact that the gender pay gap is still an issue in 2018 shows that a lot of lip service is being paid, but not enough action is being taken to tackle inequality. \"With Pink IPA, we are making a statement the only way we know how - with beer.\" By creating a stereotypically pink label, the company says it is having a dig at other campaigns to target women. \"Pink IPA is clearly an over-the-top ridiculing of the types of sexist marketing we often see from brands trying to engage a female audience,\" Sarah added. \"We always anticipated that some people might not immediately appreciate the irony of Pink IPA but that did not deter us in our mission to spark a conversation about the gender pay gap.\" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

        "content": "Police in Rwanda have arrested six pastors they accuse of being the \"masterminds\" behind a plot to defy a government order closing churches. The suspects allegedly held \"illegal meetings with bad intentions\" following the closure of more than 700 churches and a mosque in the capital Kigali. The government says the structures all fail to comply with building regulations and noise pollution laws. Among those arrested was famous pastor Bishop Rugagi Innocent. He was allegedly heard calling the decision to stop the churches from operating \"abrupt\", according to the BBC's Prudent Nsengiyumya. Rwandan police spokesman Theos Badege told news agency AFP on Tuesday the six Pentecostal preachers \"conducted illegal meetings with bad intentions aimed at calling for the directives to be defied\". \"After the suspension of churches that did not meet required standards, some church leaders began illegal meetings intended to defy and obstruct the directive,\" he added. \"Police began investigations to find the masterminds behind this illegal act.\" Most of the are churches closed were small Pentecostal ones. Pentecostal churches, often run by charismatic preachers claiming to be able to perform miracles, have grown rapidly in many parts of Africa in recent years. Some are massive, attracting thousands of worshippers each Sunday, but others consist of tiny structures built without planning permission. A government official told the BBC that some of the more than 700 buildings shut down have already reopened after they were approved by inspectors. According to a proposed new law, all preachers must have theological training before opening a church. Government official Justus Kangwagye told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme that they simply required the churches to meet \"modest standards\". But President Paul Kagame has publicly questioned the need for the churches. \"Seven hundred churches in Kigali? Are these boreholes that give people water?\" he said last Thursday, the East African newspaper reported. ",

Adam Brenton tweeted criticism of Myprotein Impact Diet Whey seller The Hut.com Ltd and contacted local press with his claims. The story was widely republished but \"unequivocal\" evidence proved the mouse was not present at delivery. At the High Court, Brenton, of Manchester, apologised to The Hut.com Ltd and the manufacturer Cend Ltd. Their advocate, Mathilde Groppo, told Mr Justice Nicklin that Brenton had been a regular satisfied customer since 2009.

Brenton agreed to hand over the items for testing but criticised The Hut.com Ltd's \"awful\" and \"inept\" customer service on Twitter. A newspaper article, which alleged his health had been put at risk, was picked up by the national press and republished in print and on the internet, Ms Groppo said.

Ms Groppo said evidence was \"categorical and unequivocal\" that it could not have entered the product during production and was not present at delivery. She said: \"The suggestion that the complainants were at fault for allowing the mouse to enter the protein powder during the production process, thereby potentially causing harm to Mr Brenton and other customers' health, was false.\" Brenton told the judge in London he agreed with the evidence and that The Hut.com Ltd's customer service was \"beyond criticism\".

The magazine said the drop was partially due to a fall in the value of central New York property values and falling revenues at his golf courses. Top of the list is the founder and boss of online giant Amazon, Jeff Bezos. Mr Bezos' fortune has leapt to $112bn from an estimated $39.2bn last year. The improvement in Mr Bezos' fortune is the biggest on record. His rise knocks Microsoft founder Bill Gates, whose estimated wealth is $90bn this year, up from $86bn, into second place. Mr Gates has headed the list for 18 of the past 24 years. A record 2,208 billionaires feature on the magazine's 32nd annual ranking of the world's billionaires. US investment superstar Warren Buffett, who is worth $84bn, is third. His fortune is up from $75.6bn a year earlier. The richest person in Europe and fourth on the list is the boss of luxury goods firm LVMH, Bernard Arnault, who has a fortune of $72bn. 'Widening gap'\nThe US has the most billionaires by country, with 585, followed by Greater China. California alone has 144 billionaires, more than any country besides the US and China. Germany has the most of any European country, with 123. India has 119 billionaires and Russia 102. There are 53 billionaires in the UK according to Forbes, down from 54 in 2017. Luisa Kroll and Kerry Dolan, from Forbes Media, said: \"The superrich continue to get richer, widening the gap between them and everyone else.\" The Forbes billionaires list is a snapshot of wealth taken on February 9, 2018.

But as it finds itself at the centre of a modern-day mystery, what do the residents of Salisbury make of its new-found fame? Quiet. Normal. Quintessentially English. Words like these make medieval Salisbury seem an unlikely home for a former Russian spy. And yet on Sunday, this small city in Wiltshire found itself the topic of global conversation when current resident Sergei Skripal became ill near the main shopping centre. It would probably not have been newsworthy in itself, except it transpired he was once a military intelligence colonel who was convicted, and later pardoned, for passing the identities of Russian secret agents in Europe to the UK's intelligence service, MI6. When the 66-year-old and his 33-year-old daughter Yulia Skripa were found unconscious on a bench near The Maltings, police soon revealed they believed the pair had been exposed to an \"unknown substance\". Now, around the seat where they were found, a tent has been erected. The nearby branch of Zizzi is closed - a tight-lipped police officer guarding the door. The Mill pub, about 200m from the restaurant, is also shut. But far from perturbed by the activity unfolding around them, residents and workers simply zigzag around the cordons. People are more worried about the local pie shop being closed, says Leuene Jackman, peering over the police tape at the forensics team. \"Quite a few shops have been closed, it won't be good for business,\" she remarks. \"You just think this sort of thing happens in other parts of the country. \"This is such a quiet city.\" Typically known for its cathedral and proximity to Stonehenge, the city is one of the UK's smallest with a population of about 40,000 people. It has been home to many celebrities with Sting, Madonna and Guy Ritchie among those living in nearby villages. The late author Terry Pratchett and former prime minster Edward Heath also called Salisbury home. Now a far less famous resident has given the city the dubious honour of making it an unwitting backdrop to an unfolding mystery that has the hallmarks of a spy novel. \"It's just weird,\" says Janice Parks on of the main shopping thoroughfares. \"Salisbury is just so quintessentially English.\" She hurries on, rejoining the other shoppers navigating the narrow alleys and busy marketplace. \"It's business as usual really,\" says stall holder, Amanda Barlow. \"People have been looking up into the sky a bit more than normal, watching the circling helicopter. \"It's such a sleepy, tight-knit place. We were quite surprised but it hasn't put people off visiting.\" The hot topic of conversation in the cafes and shops has certainly been about \"that Russian spy\" - who despite the close-knit community clich\u00e9, seems relatively unknown to those milling around the streets. \"It goes to show we don't know who we live next door to,\" muses Penny Muxworthy, who lives just outside the city. \"People have jobs that might necessitate them [keeping from] people what it is that they do. \"It could happen anywhere.\" Outside the Mill pub, Frank Carter, agrees. \"Salisbury is out of the way isn't it,\" says the 87-year-old, who has lived there his whole life. \"You wouldn't expect it here.\" But many remain seemingly unruffled by the news. \"I'm not nervous for my own safety,\" says Sue Doe, smoking a cigarette a stone's throw from the closed Zizzi restaurant. \"I'm just interested to know what's happened.\" Others are less keen about the attention it has attracted. \"You're not from the telly are you? I don't want to be on the telly,\" said a man who did not want to be named. \"There's cameramen and [media] on every street corner, you can't move for them.\" For others, the publicity is a welcome moment in the spotlight. \"Well, it's definitely put Salisbury on the map,\" quips Doris Bright, before going about her day.

A 30-second trailer teases how her character's love affair ends, ahead of the second half of the latest season which airs in the US from 28 March. Meghan has played Rachel Zane since the show began in 2011, but will bow out at the end of this seventh series. The 36-year-old has quit acting to focus on her royal commitments, ahead of marrying Prince Harry on 19 May. From coworkers to lovers and everything in between. Find out how Mike and Rachel's story ends when #Suits returns March 28. pic.twitter.com/U1nGZvmdUV End of Twitter post by @Suits_USA The clip has a strong romantic tone and sees Rachel gaze lovingly into Mike's (Patrick J. Adams) eyes. They also kiss several times and the emotion is all a bit much for some fans of the show to take. \u201cAre you emotionally prepared for Suits to come back?\u201d \u201cDo you think you\u2019re ready for all the Darvey angst?\u201d \u201cAre you ready to see Rachel and Mike say goodbye to Donna and Harvey?\u201d Me: pic.twitter.com/q1N2bGtor7 End of Twitter post by @darveymylove I cry.

Rachel is heard saying \"you are my future\" a little later on. Meghan's new role will see her carry out royal duties with Prince Harry, including charity work and foreign visits. But on the small screen she's been a key part of helping to make Suits a big success and the show gave her her big break. The new season will be the second half of the seventh series, while an eighth has already been confirmed. But Mike and Rachel won't be a part of the latter, meaning it's nearly time for fans to say an emotional goodbye. UK viewers can watch the show on Netflix from 29 March.

This is the question that has caused controversy after RuPaul admitted in a Guardian interview he would \"probably not\" accept a person who has transitioned gender competing on the show. A backlash ensued on social media as fans of the show and former contestants chimed in on the debate, and RuPaul has since apologised in a tweet which has been liked over 26,000 times. Each morning I pray to set aside everything I THINK I know, so I may have an open mind and a new experience. I understand and regret the hurt I have caused.

Critics of RuPaul's comments include Sasha Velour, the current reigning champion of the show. My drag was born in a community full of trans women, trans men, and gender non-conforming folks doing drag. That\u2019s the real world of drag, like it or not. I thinks it\u2019s fabulous and I will fight my entire life to protect and uplift it. End of Twitter post by @sasha_velour Velour's post was well received on Reddit's subsection dedicated to the show, where one user praised the 2017 winner for having the \"rebellion and guts to speak up when it's aimed at RuPaul while you're current reigning\". People in the RuPaul's Drag Race subreddit were initially critical of the host, with many praising the former contestants such as Velour for their comments. Following the apology, some fans praised RuPaul for his contrition, with one user saying they were \"very proud\" of the drag icon, and another saying \"this is a step in the right direction\". Outside of Reddit, other former contestants joined the conversation, with Season 2 contender Tatianna tweeting \"drag is for everyone,\" while All Stars contestant BenDeLaCreme spoke about having a partner who is trans. My partner of almost three years is trans, and #bendelachrist help anyone who tries to tell him what he can and can\u2019t do. Just sayin\u2019. End of Twitter post by @bendelacreme Some Twitter users felt RuPaul did not need to apologise for his original comments, with people drawing a line between drag and trans. Some agreed while others tried to establish where the differences may be between drag performance and trans identification. I really DON'T think that ru is offending to Trans community, Depend of the way you take the explanation about it, ALL TIME i have clear about Rupaul Drag race is... A DRAG SHOW NOT a Drag Trans Show! And that don't mean that he is been discriminatory End of Twitter post by @Gerson_soler In a second tweet, RuPaul clarified that despite his original comments, the programme has never discriminated against trans contestants by writing: \"The only thing we've ever screened for is charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent, and that will never change.\" And in a post liked more than 6,000 times, Mic journalist Evan Ross Katz tweeted a list of former competitors who would not be allowed to compete if RuPaul stood by his original comments.

However police found no trace of the animal, which was described as yellow and 90cm (3ft) long. It is now thought the couple may have seen a leopard cat. Experts say tigers have not been seen in Hong Kong for more than 50 years. Leopard cats, which can grow up to about 70cm in length, are found in parts of Asia including China. The couple called the police on Tuesday morning after they saw the animal on Ma On Shan Country Park. They were escorted downhill by an officer. \"They claimed the animal was yellow in colour and measured about 3 feet by 2 feet. They were worried, so they called police,\" a police spokesman told the South China Morning Post. The couple were sent to hospital suffering from shock, Radio Television Hong Kong reported. The couple were later shown photos of various feline animals - and said a photo of a leopard cat was similar to the animal they saw. Dr Michael Lau, a director at the WWF's Wetlands Conservation department, told the BBC it was \"highly unlikely\" that the animal they saw was a wild tiger. \"The South China tiger is probably extirpated from the region, plus the size of the animal is small and if it were a tiger it would be a cub, [meaning that] its mother would be nearby and likely signs of kills would be seen by people,\" Dr Lau said. \"Hong Kong also no longer has enough space to support tigers. The last substantiated tiger sighting was in Shatin in 1947.\" Timothy Bonebrake of the School of Biological Sciences, University of Hong Kong, told the BBC \"the likelihood of it being a tiger is close to zero per cent\", and added that \"leopard cats that are relatively abundant in parts of Hong Kong\". While the South China tiger is considered to be \"functionally extinct\", the Leopard Cat population is considered stable. Leopard cats typically have yellow or reddish brown coats with dark spots and streaks, and are nocturnal. ",

        "content": "A robot wolf designed to protect farms has proved to be such a success in trials that it is going into mass production next month. The \"Super Monster Wolf\" is a 65cm-long, 50cm-tall robot animal covered with realistic-looking fur, featuring huge white fangs and flashing red eyes, Asahi Television reports. It's been designed to keep wild boar away from rice and chestnut crops, and was deployed on a trial basis near Kisarazu City in Japan's eastern Chiba prefecture last July. When it detects an approaching animal, its eyes light up and it starts to howl, Asahi TV says. Its manufacturers say the robot wolf uses solar-rechargeable batteries and has a range of howl noises so that animal threats don't get used to it. The Japan Agricultural Cooperatives say that crop losses have noticeably decreased in areas where the Super Monster Wolf has been present. Beforehand, farmers around Kisarazu were resigned to giving up at least part of their crops to wild boar every year. Speaking to the Chiba Nippo news website, Chihiko Umezawa of the agricultural cooperative says that the device has an effective radius of about one kilometre, suggesting it is more effective than an electric fence. Now, the robot wolf is going into mass production, with units costing about 514,000 yen ($4,840; \u00a33,480) each, but there are options for farmers to pay a far cheaper monthly lease on a wolf instead.

        "content": "Citizens in an Estonian district have chosen the cannabis leaf as the symbol on their new flag and coat of arms, it's reported. The Kanepi municipality in southeast Estonia was created last July through the merger of three previously separate districts ;and as a result of the local government shake-up, residents were given the chance to vote on a new symbol to represent the district, state broadcaster ERR says. The overwhelmingly popular choice among the people of Kanepi was a design based on the cannabis leaf. According to ERR, \"kanep\" is the Estonian word for cannabis. Mayor Andrus Seeme told local media that the winning design received 12,000 of the total 15,000 votes cast, and said that he would respect the public's wishes. The design will now be sent to the Heraldry Department of the State Chancellery in the capital Tallinn for approval, Delfi news agency reports. Cannabis is illegal in Estonia, however, government official Gert Uiboed says that nobody will stand in any local authority's way if they want to use cannabis-based symbolism. \"Cannabis has been used as a heraldic symbol for a long time,\" Mr Uiboed said. \"It is up to the local government to decide exactly what symbols and ideas they want.\" Reporting by Alistair Coleman Next story: New Zealand census refusenik hides in his TARDIS Use #NewsfromElsewhere to stay up-to-date with our reports via Twitter.

Nicola, who has twice won Olympic gold medals, is the first UK star to join Barbie's 'Shero' range - designed to honour inspiring women. Manufacturers Mattel say they chose Nicola because of her outstanding contributions to boxing. \"I am so excited and honoured to be Barbie's first ever UK Shero and the first ever boxer Barbie,\" Nicola said. The Nicola Adams doll has boxing gloves, boxing gear embroidered with her 'Lioness' nickname and her distinctive cropped hairstyle. 'No female boxers when I was a kid'\n\"My hope is that everything I do helps more people realise they can do anything they put their mind to,\" Nicola said. \"Without my own role models, I wouldn't be where I am today. \"Growing up, my biggest role models were my mum and Muhammad Ali - there were no female boxers in media when I was a kid, and I might have discovered my passion sooner if I'd seen other women boxing. \"That's why empowering the next generation of kids is something I'm passionate about and it's great to work with Barbie to share my story now,\" she added. Nicola is the 15th Barbie 'Shero' - joining a list including director Ava DuVernay, gymnast Gabby Douglas and American fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad - the first hijab-wearing Barbie. \"I hope my doll inspires young girls to believe that they can break boundaries in whatever they choose to do,\" Nicola said. \"Barbie hopes to encourage girls to pursue their dreams,\" Mattel said. Barbie have also introduced their Inspiring Women doll line - a range celebrating inspirational historical figures. The first three dolls will be Mexican artist Frieda Kahlo, female aviator Amelia Earheart and Nasa mathematician Katherine Johnson, one of the women depicted in 2017 film Hidden Figures.

        "content": "An anti-census campaigner in New Zealand is hoping to avoid today's compulsory national count by hiding in a TARDIS, it's reported. The self-styled Laird McGillicuddy, otherwise known as Graeme Cairns, says he is using the Doctor Who time-travelling space craft to boycott the five-yearly census by \"travelling in time\", the New Zealand Herald reports. Mr Cairns, who was once the leader of the satirical McGillicuddy Serious Party, has a history of unusual stunts to protest the census, which is compulsory for all New Zealanders. He's once claimed not to be in New Zealand by hovering above the city of Hamilton in a hot-air balloon, and on another occasion declared himself \"temporarily dead\". He risks a fine of up to NZ$500 (US$362; \u00a3261) for refusing to fill out the form, the Stuff.co.nz website says. Five years ago, there were around 100 prosecutions for census avoidance. Census concerns\nWhile most of New Zealand's approximate 4.7m population are taking part in the census, some have concerns that the results may be skewed due to accessibility problems. The census is being conducted primarily online, but Stuff.co.nz says some people who requested paper versions of the form have not received them; while some blind New Zealanders said that they have experienced real difficulties completing the forms. The opposition New Zealand National Party says that a lack of disabled access to the forms means that \"it's likely the results will be skewed, because so many people from this sector of society won't be represented\". It's a concern echoed among the country's indigenous population, with Maori Television saying that \"Kaumatua (Maori elders), the disabled and youth seem to be particularly at risk of being left out\" because they're not online, or have not received the access codes required to access the forms. With the census being a tool to help the government make decisions about future funding, there are fears that groups most in need of government assistance may not be counted accurately.

After this discovery, he began to explore fatherhood among black Americans. Lee says the US media mainly portrays black fathers in one of two ways: And his project, on display at the Bronx Documentary Centre, in New York, aims for a more balanced and nuanced portrayal. In 2011, Lee began to photograph families from all walks of life across the US, finding his subjects through social media, referrals from friends, or simply approaching them in the street. Over time, he became friends with a number of black fathers And, by immersing himself in their daily lives, he gradually gained access to intimate family moments, \"scenarios that are fleeting and often hidden from the public realm but nonetheless meaningful\". \"Few of the men I met were in traditional relationships, but they were loving, present and responsible fathers nonetheless,\" he says. By undertaking this project, Lee was able to work through some of the issues he had around his own upbringing. And it is this emotional connection to the work that he believes makes it so powerful. Father Figure: Exploring Alternate Notions of Black Fatherhood is at the Bronx Documentary Centre, New York, until 31 March 2018. ",

        "content": "What do Donald Trump, Jeremy Corbyn, and Rodrigo Duterte have in common? Despite their differences, each man has been labelled a populist. Populism is on the rise - especially among Europe's right, and in the US, where it helped crown Mr Trump. Italy's populist Five Star Movement and anti-immigrant League parties have emerged as two major players in the latest elections - the most recent of several such results in Europe. But there's a difference between being popular and being populist. The pure people\nIn political science, populism is the idea that society is separated into two groups at odds with one another - \"the pure people\" and \"the corrupt elite\", according to Cas Mudde, author of Populism: A Very Short Introduction. The term is often used as a kind of shorthand political insult. Britain's Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has been accused of populism over his party's slogan \"for the many, not the few\" - but that's not quite the same thing. The word \"is generally misused, especially in a European context,\" according to Benjamin Moffitt, author of The Global Rise of Populism. The true populist leader claims to represent the unified \"will of the people\". He stands in opposition to an enemy, often embodied by the current system - aiming to \"drain the swamp\" or tackle the \"liberal elite\". \"It generally attaches itself to the right in a European context\u2026 but that's not an iron rule,\" Dr Moffitt said. Rise of the Right\nPopulist parties can be anywhere on the political spectrum. In Latin America, there was Venezuela's late President Ch\u00e1vez. In Spain, there is the Podemos party, and in Greece the label has also been applied to Syriza. All these are on the left. But \"most successful populists today are on the right, particularly the radical right,\" Prof Mudde said. Politicians \"like Marine Le Pen in France, Viktor Orb\u00e1n in Hungary, and Donald Trump in the US, combine populism with [anti-immigrant] nativism and authoritarianism,\" he added. Commentators - from Time magazine to the President of the European Commission - have been warning about the rise of right-wing populism for years. But in reality, it's nothing new. \"Political scientists have been catching on to this for the last 25-30 years,\" Dr Moffitt says - but admits \"there's been an acceleration.\" Experts point to both societal changes like multiculturalism and globalism, and more concrete crises as behind the rise of populist parties in Europe. Martin Bull, Director of the European Consortium of Political Research (ECPR), says the emergence of populist parties in Europe could be seen in the early 2000s - but they remained small for several years. The swell in support seemed to happen \"from 2008 - and particularly in 2011, when the banking crisis turned into a sovereign debt crisis\", he said. It was a rare occasion when an elite class - the wealthy bankers - could be identified as more or less directly responsible for a crisis which affected the majority of society. 'I am the people'\nIn his book The Global Rise of Populism, Dr Moffitt argues that there are other traits associated with the typical populist leader. One is \"bad manners\", or behaving in a way that's not typical of politicians - a tactic employed by President Trump and the Philippines' President Duterte. The other, he says, is \"perpetuating a state of crisis\" - and always seeming to be on the offensive. \"A populist leader who gets into power is 'forced' to be in a permanent campaign to convince his people that he is not establishment - and never will be,\" according to Prof Nadia Urbinati from Columbia University. She argues that populist content is \"made of negatives\" - whether it is anti-politics, anti-intellectualism, or anti-elite. Here lies one of the populism's strengths - it is versatile. It is \"extraordinarily powerful because it can adapt to all situations,\" she said. Another common thread among populist leaders is they tend to dislike the \"complicated democratic systems\" of modern government - preferring direct democracy like referendums instead, according to Prof Bull. That also ties in to its links to authoritarianism, he argues - a lack of trust in the established system gives rise to \"strongman\" leaders. \"Ultimately, the leader makes the decision in a way that just isn't possible in traditional democracies,\" he says. That sentiment is perhaps best embodied by the late left-wing Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who once said: \"I am not an individual - I am the people\". Such thinking \"can lead to people thinking they're infallible,\" Dr Moffitt said. \"It restructures the political space in a new and scary way\". After all, if you're not with \"the people\" - then you must be against us. That is why populist leaders are often viewed with suspicion - and why the term is often used as a type of insult for a politician who promises too much. It's what Prof Bull says is called \"irresponsible bidding\". \"In order to garner support, they're quicker than the establishment party to make offers, or to promise to change things\u2026 that on closer inspection may not turn out to be feasible,\" he said. \"You might question how good that is for democracy,\" he added.

        "content": "The Academy Awards are over for another year and the winners are floating on a wave of fuzzy glory. But time and star status wait for no one - even holders of a shiny gold Oscar. To capitalise on the public and movie moguls' interest, the winning stars need to get back to work to keep themselves on the screen, big or small. Here's what we can look forward to from the triumphant actors, actresses and director in the not too distant future . Gary Oldman\nWon: Best actor for Darkest Hour How many Oscars is that now? One So what's next? Hunter Killer What is it? A US naval action thriller, based on the 2012 novel Firing Point by Don Keith and George Wallace. Who co-stars and directs? Gerard Butler, best known for 300, stars alongside Oldman. Both play naval officers aboard a US nuclear submarine. The relatively unknown Donovan Marsh is at the helm. When will it be in cinemas? At the moment, there is no release date for either the UK or the US. But it did come out in Turkey and Brazil at the end of last year. Frances McDormand\nWon: Best actress for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri How many Oscars is that now? Two. The first was for Fargo in 1997. So what's next? Animated canine movie Isle of Dogs, set in a futuristic Japan. McDormand voices the Japanese city of Megasaki's news translator. What's it about? Isle of Dogs is the story of 12-year-old Atari Kobayashi, the ward of the corrupt Mayor Kobayashi. When the mayor exiles all the dogs from the city to a vast wasteland, Atari sets off on an adventure to find his own pet Spots. Who co-stars and directs? Bryan Cranston, Greta Gerwig, Bill Murray, Edward Norton and Scarlett Johanssen are among the other voice stars. The project is led by Wes Anderson, director of The Royal Tenenbaums and The Grand Budapest Hotel. When will it be in cinemas? It's out in the US on 23 March and in the UK on 30 March. Guillermo del Toro\nWon: Best director for The Shape of Water How many Oscars is that now? Two, as The Shape of Water also won best film. Previously best known for: Pan's Labyrinth So what's next? Del Toro is supposed to be making a documentary about fellow director Michael Mann. (Del Toro is a big fan.) On the feature side, he is also supposed to be adding his unique twist to the classic fairy story Pinocchio. What are they about? Michael Mann is the director behind films such as The Last of the Mohicans, Collateral and Heat. Pinocchio is the story of a wooden boy puppet who unwisely tells fibs and, when he does, grows a rather long nose. Who stars? Er, Michael Mann. And an unknown cast, either real or animated or both, for Pinocchio. When will it be in cinemas? Both are at the \"ideas\" stage at the moment, according to del Toro's publicist. Allison Janney\nWon: Best supporting actress for I, Tonya How many Oscars is that now?: One So what's next? There are no (publicised) films on the cards, but Janney can be seen in US comedy series Mom, now in its fifth season. What's it about? A newly sober single mother trying to pull her life together while dealing with her wayward mother. Who co-stars and directs? Anna Faris is Janney's sidekick, playing daughter Christy to Janney's mom Bonnie. The director is James Widdoes, who's probably best known for acting in the 1978 film National Lampoon's Animal House. When will it be on screen?: Season five is showing in the US on CBS. The show can also be seen on RTE in Ireland. There are no plans to show more on UK television at the moment, but the show can be watched on Amazon.

        "content": "British designer Anna Bullus is on a mission to recycle chewing gum into useful objects, cleaning up our streets in the process. More than \u00a314bn is spent on chewing gum around the world each year, but a lot of that gum will end up stuck to the ground. Gum is the second most common type of street litter after cigarette materials. In the UK, councils spend around \u00a350m each year cleaning up the mess. But Anna had an idea. What if the sticky stuff could actually be recycled and turned into useful objects? Around 10 years ago, she began a project looking at kerbside litter. She examined random samples, looking at things like crisp packets and cigarette butts. She then tried to figure out which elements could be recycled. \"One of the litters I found was a piece of chewing gum and as a designer I was completely amazed there was nothing actually being done to recycle it,\" she said. Researching the chemistry of chewing gum, she discovered that its main ingredient, the gum base, is commonly a synthetic rubber, a type of polymer similar to plastic. Hear more\n\"It's called polyisobutylene,\" explains Anna, \"the same stuff you find in the inner tube of bicycle wheels.\" It is obtained from petrochemicals, which are refined from fossil fuels like crude oil. She realised that chewing gum, even once it has been finished with, is a versatile and potentially useful material. Collecting gum\nBut how do you persuade people to donate their gum - instead of carelessly tossing it on to the street? As part of her strategy, Anna created bright pink, bubble-shaped bins specially for disposing of gum called Gumdrop, which can be hung at head-height. These bins are themselves made of recycled chewing gum. A message next to the bins explains that any gum collected will be recycled into new objects. But would gum-chewers use them? The University of Winchester was one of the first places to sign up to use the bins. Around 8,000 people live and work on its campus and the authorities wanted to keep it clean of gum litter. It adopted a twin-pronged strategy to tackle the problem. It installed 11 of Anna's special bins and to reinforce the message that gum can be recycled if disposed of responsibly, it gave out hundreds of coffee cups made of recycled gum to first-year students. \"Students would give the cup a sniff to check it didn't smell of mint or bubble gum,\" recalls Liz Harris, the university's environmental officer. \"It's because so much of the chewing gum sold on the high street is a polymer [so it] can be used to make new products. 'When people get it, it's a really nice moment.\" Eighteen months later, the university noticed a drop in gum litter and is expanding the scheme. Heathrow Airport also ran a three-month trial which it said led to a \"noticeable improvement\" and saved it \u00a36,000 in cleaning costs. Great Western Railway has installed the bins in more than 25 of its railway stations and is rolling out the scheme further. In each case, the bins did not suddenly solve the problem of gum litter, but they did seem to begin to change people's behaviour. Moulding gum\nAnother challenge for Anna was to find industrial partners willing to recycle old gum - something completely novel. She eventually persuaded a recycling plant in Worcester to get on board. It takes her bins and filters out unwanted material, like paper or sweet wrappers, before grinding it into pieces and then compounds this with other recycled plastic polymers. The proportion in the mixture varies, but Anna says each object she makes contains a minimum of 20% chewing gum. At a plastic moulding specialist in Leicester called Amber Valley, which normally makes alarm casings, Anna creates her designer objects. Here, the mixture containing the old chewing gum is put into an injection moulding machine. It is heated and then ejected as a paste, which can be moulded into new objects as it cools. \"There's no difference [from] the equivalent polypropylene material that it's based against, the processing temperatures and parameters are all identical,\" says Brett Nixon, a manager at the plant. \"When you are handling the finished product, you do take a while to adjust to the fact that this has been in somebody's mouth previously. 'But once you get over that fear it's easy. By recycling it and giving it another lease of life it's helping the environment, it's an absolutely fantastic idea.\" Industry response\nThe UK Parliament has considered imposing taxes on chewing gum companies if they do not do more to combat gum litter. Anna's project has been given financial support from Wrigley, one of the largest manufacturers. It also provides her with surplus material from its Plymouth factory to add to her supply. Alex Hunter-Dunn, a spokesman for Wrigley, explained why the company backs the project. \"Gumdrop is a really creative and innovative way to get people responsibly disposing of their gum and binning it. We fundamentally believe that behaviour change is the only long-term sustainable solution to tackle the issue and we are very much behind that.\" Other approaches are being tried to beat the scourge of gum litter. Researchers have worked on a synthetic chewing gum that is biodegradable and will wash off the streets more easily, which is also the case with an organic chewing gum, made from Chicle gum native to Central America, which has a small market. But in the current market, dominated by synthetic, non-biodegradable gum, Anna thinks her method is the best option on the table. \"I do believe that through right design, \" she says, \"we can actually change the way people behave.\" Follow Dougal Shaw on Twitter @dougalshawbbc You can learn more about recycling chewing gum in the latest People Fixing the World podcastfrom the BBC World Service ",

The Daily Mail says he may have been the target of a \"revenge hit\" by former Russian colleagues. He is said to have recently told police he feared for his life. Sources tell the Times nothing is being ruled out - including the illicit administering of \"something very sinister\". The Daily Telegraph says an unknown substance was removed from the scene, wrapped in protective layers. Wiltshire Police say they are investigating whether a crime has been committed. But Garry Kasparov - the former world chess champion and a prominent critic of President Putin - tells the paper: \"After the UK's pathetic response to the assassination of Alexander Litvinenko - why wouldn't Putin do it again?\" \"Another scandal with a Russophobic tinge is brewing\" is how the story is introduced by the Moscow daily Komsomolskaya Pravda. It suggests UK intelligence services may be involved in the incident in order apparently to discredit Russia and prevent the normalisation of relations with Britain. The website of the Russian broadcaster RT says the British media are \"rushing\" to compare the incident with the death of the former Russian security officer Alexander Litvinenko from radiation poisoning in 2006. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning Sir Bradley Wiggins is the focus of a story in the Times which identifies him as an investor in a tax avoidance scheme that has been described as \"notorious\" and \"shocking\" by MPs. The Cup Trust, which was closed down last year, used a charity as a front to avoid tens of millions of pounds in tax. The arrangement is not illegal and a spokesman for Sir Bradley tells the Times he has paid all his due taxes and has no open inquiries with HMRC. The Financial Times leads with a claim that transatlantic routes operated by British airlines are at risk, after negotiations with the US for a post-Brexit flights deal got off to a tough start. The current arrangement stems from the UK's membership of the European Union. The sticking point is said to be US rules about foreign ownership as British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have large overseas shareholdings. The Sun is deeply unhappy about a call for the food industry to cut the calorie content of popular dishes. It detects a snobbery about what it calls the \"professional meddlers\" at Public Health England, who it accuses of seeking to victimise and bully the poorest for what they eat. For the Daily Mirror, the announcement does not go far enough. 'Welcome guest'\nThe Daily Telegraph heralds the arrival of the reforming Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, who is due to visit the UK this week. He has given an interview to the paper, in which he emphasises the importance of defence links. The Telegraph asserts that Saudi Arabia is important to the UK in many other respects too - as a market, a potential investor and a bulwark against Islamic extremism. As such, the paper says, he is a welcome guest on British shores. The former BBC television presenter Bill Turnbull is shown on the front of the Daily Mirror and the Daily Express with the revelation that he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. In an interview, he says he knows his time with his family has been shortened, and speaks of his regret he did not get checked sooner. The Mirror urges its readers to \"listen to Bill\" and go to the doctor when the body starts to present warning signs. Mind the glass\nThe problem of birds colliding with the glass windows of office buildings is a fairly common one. It is less heard-of with human employees. But such is life at Apple's new spaceship-style headquarters in Cupertino, California where - according to the Guardian - workers distracted by their phones keep walking into glass windows and injuring themselves. A building inspector is said to have warned that the Norman Foster-designed circular building would leave employees struggling to tell the difference between windows and doors. The Guardian says in the first month after opening, three people walked or ran into transparent partitions so hard they needed emergency treatment. ",

        "content": "Argentina's centre-right government has, for the first time, said it would consider holding a referendum on legalising abortion. It is \"on the table\", Cabinet Chief Marcos Pe\u00f1a said. Meanwhile a bill put forward on Tuesday would allow women to terminate pregnancies during the first 14 weeks. President Mauricio Macri said he was personally opposed to relaxing the country's abortion laws, but he would give his Congress allies a free vote. Abortion is a controversial issue in the predominantly Catholic nation. It is only allowed in cases of rape, when the mother's life is deemed to be at risk, or when there is a severe malformation of the foetus. Women seeking abortions must apply to a judge for permission, which critics say can unnecessarily delay the procedure. More than 70 Argentine members of Congress put forward a bill during a ceremony attended by dozens of activists. At the bill's presentation in Buenos Aires, opposition MP Aracelia Ferreyra said reform of the Argentine abortion law was \"a topic of equality and inequality\". In several Latin American countries, abortion is illegal in any circumstance. In August 2017, Chile's constitutional court approved a bill to ease the country's total ban on abortions. Abortions are illegal in Brazil, except in health emergencies or cases of rape or, since 2012, in cases of anencephaly, where the foetus's brain fails to grow. Uruguay, which borders Argentina, permits abortions. Several Roman Catholic countries, including Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Malta, The Vatican and Dominican Republic, have an abortion ban in all circumstances. Ireland, a traditionally Roman Catholic country, will hold a referendum on whether to reform the country's near-total ban on abortion in May 2018. ",

        "content": "A recent report has said the south Indian city of Bangalore could be doomed, like Cape Town in South Africa, to face the threat of running out of drinking water. But is this really the case? The BBC's Imran Qureshi investigates. The fact that Bangalore is under \"water stress\" cannot be denied. The term is used to refer to pressure on water resources which causes problems like shortages. Officials and experts admit the growth of the city has put pressure on its water resources, particularly because in the last few years alone more than 100 villages have been absorbed into this rapidly expanding metropolis, known as India's Silicon Valley. In 2012, nine million people lived in Bangalore. Now, there are 11 million. Government officials say shortage of water is a very real problem, particularly in the peripheral areas of the city which are already dependant on tankers for drinking water supply. These tankers get their supply from borewells, but as demand increases they are being forced to dig deeper and deeper to find water. The Bangalore water supply and sewerage board ( BWSSB), the agency that provides drinking water and manages the city's sewage system, acknowledges that in 2014, a survey predicted Bangalore was on the verge of running out of water. But, they say the situation has changed since then - one critical government decision just may have staved off complete disaster, at least for now. In 2013, the government decided to divert an additional 10 thousand million cubic feet of water from the Cauvery river to Bangalore for its drinking water needs. The Cauvery is the principal source of water for not just the city, but also for the irrigation needs of much of Karnataka state where Bangalore is located. And Cauvery water is precious. The state has been involved for more than a century in a dispute over sharing water resources from the river with neighbouring Tamil Nadu state. The Supreme Court has had to intervene on multiple occasions, but has also permitted states to prioritise the use of water for drinking purposes. \"The current supply of water to Bangalore amounts to about 100 litres of water per person per day,\" Tushar Girinath, chairman of the water supply board, told the BBC. Officials estimate that by diverting the river water, the city will gain a little more than 50% of its current supply. The project, called \"Cauvery Water Supply Stage Five\", is funded by the Japanese International Cooperation Agency. The additional supply is expected to help Bangalore provide drinking water to a 225 sq km (87 sq-mile) area that is currently dependent upon water supplied via borewells and tankers. In addition to the additional supply from the Cauvery, the city will in the next 18 months also receive water from another river called the Nethravati. Mr Girinath said this would make the water position of the city more \"comfortable\". \"Yes, we will face some water stress until 2023. But we certainly are not facing a crisis, because we are augmenting the supply,\" he said. Officials say the plan has taken the rapid growth of the city into account. Merely increasing supply will not be enough to ensure Bangalore has adequate water supply though. The city's residents also need to participate in conservation and harvesting efforts. But this has not been the case so far. The water board has run massive campaigns promoting rainwater harvesting in an effort to help replenish ground water supplies. But this has got a disappointing response. It is mandatory for people to construct rainwater harvesting facilities at their homes, but this is often ignored. The board in fact, collects a sum of more than 20m rupees (about $300,000; \u00a3222,000) in fines every month from people who have not complied. \"Bangalore's annual rainfall alone could give the city 2,740 million litres of water a day,\" Vishwanath Srikantaiah, a water expert, told the BBC. Mr Girinath adds that people will also have to begin recycling water using their own sewage treatment plants. \"They will also have to understand that the board cannot provide treated water. Our sewage treatment plants are so huge that we have set them up outside the city. So, we expect people living in complexes housing 50 or more apartments to construct smaller plants to treat water for their own needs,\" he said. A sewage treatment plant small enough to be used by an apartment costs around 750,000 rupees to install. People living in smaller houses or slums will get free treated water from the water board. \"Of the 100 litres used by every person per day, people need only 20 litres for cooking, drinking water and bathing purposes. The remaining 80 litres is used for non-potable purposes like flushing toilets, cleaning floors and washing cars,'' BN Tyagaraja, who headed an expert panel to look for additional water sources, told the BBC. \"The citizens have to realise that water is a scarce commodity. Not just in Bangalore but across the world. We need to conserve water,\" he said. Mr Srikantaiah agrees. \"Bangalore is not likely to run out of water but we will have to manage it well,\" he says.

        "content": "WeChat has hit one billion monthly users for the first time, the owner of the Chinese messaging app has revealed. The vast majority of its users are based in China, where it's known as Weixin, and where the recent Lunar New Year boosted it past the milestone. But it is still lagging behind Facebook-owned WhatsApp which has about 1.5 billion monthly users. WeChat is the jewel in the crown of Chinese tech giant Tencent. But why is it so popular? Here are five reasons it has done so well. It's not just about messaging\nSure, it began as a messaging app. And it does at first glance look and feel a bit like WhatsApp and Viber. But WeChat evolved quickly, and it lets users do much more than just communicate with their friends and family. It serves as China's biggest social network. But it's also where people turn to book a taxi, order food, make a doctors appointment, do their banking, or find a date. And when they are playing games like the huge Tencent-owned hit Honour of Kings, WeChat is where players compare scores with their friends. It has become integral to the daily life of many in China, especially in the cities. It is quite possible to get through an entire day using the app for (pretty much) your every need, which means it's only going to grow. It makes paying for things simple\nThe growth of digital payments in China means many younger people have skipped the credit card concept for paying online. Instead they use payments services run by local tech giants like Alibaba or Tencent. WeChat's payments feature lets users upload their banking details and then can buy products or services from any official account. Even taking a small percentage from each transaction makes WeChat in one of Tencent's best-earners. You might also be interested in:\nCorporations love it\nWeChat has let millions of businesses get into the smartphones of customers and would-be customers. Companies and organisations can create official accounts within WeChat - a little like apps. Some do this before they even set up an app of their own. Users can subscribe to the accounts and get promotions messaged directly to them or click in be taken to a shopping page,. And the payment system already mentioned means if firms can persuade a user to part with some cash, the process of making that transaction is pretty straight forward. And WeChat is a big reason QR Codes have been adopted so readily in China - technology that helps firms get information to users as well as facilitate those payments. Also, while WeChat has been fairly conservative in the amount of advertising it allows on its platform, it is a very targeted way for corporations to reach people. It is unashamedly China-focussed\nWhile it is making in-roads in South East Asia and South Africa, WeChat really is still all about China. It understands that market, and taps into what Chinese users are doing both online and offline. For example, the giving of red envelopes containing money at Lunar New Year - the country's biggest annual holiday - is a huge tradition. A few years back WeChat introduced digital versions of these \"hongbao\" and its popularity has soared. During the festival which just ended, more than 688 million WeChat users sent or received them. The Great Firewall doesn't apply\nRestrictions on access to many Western social media services such as Facebook and Twitter - as well as Google - meant most Chinese people do not have access to these services legally, even if they wanted them And that created an environment where local players like WeChat could thrive. So too did QQ - another Tencent-owned platform which migrated its users over to WeChat, another boost to its user base. All Chinese social media platforms are required to censor public posts deemed illegal by the government. WeChat is no different. But it insists encryption means others can't \"snoop\" on your messages - and that content such as text, audio and images are not stored on its servers - and are deleted once all intended recipients have read them. Earlier this year it issued a statement denying \"storing chat histories\" after criticism from Chinese businessman Li Shufu, who recently said the firm \"must be watching all our WeChats every day\". The Tencent-owned firm said suggestions that it was watching users was \"pure misunderstanding\". ",

        "content": "Imagine being able to charge your electric car in minutes rather than hours, or your smartphone in seconds. That's the enticing prospect being touted by researchers who reckon they've discovered a new material that could boost the performance of a carbon-based supercapacitor - sometimes called an ultracapacitor - a type of energy storage device that can be charged very quickly and offload its power very quickly, too. Dr Donald Highgate, director of research at Superdielectrics Ltd, says a material he originally developed for soft contact lenses is also surprisingly good at holding an electrostatic field. Very simply, supercapacitors don't produce electricity through chemical reactions as conventional batteries do, they create these electrostatic fields. Dr Highgate is working with Bristol and Surrey universities to develop supercapacitors using the new polymer and hopes that they could eventually rival, or even surpass, lithium-ion (li-ion) batteries - so long as they manage to replicate prototype performance on a large scale. So far, supercapacitors have been good at providing quick bursts of power - to start a car engine, for example, or to give trains a boost when accelerating. They're also well-suited to harvesting energy from vehicles when they brake, making them an important component in electric vehicles. And national electricity grids use them to provide quick power top-ups when balancing supply and demand. South Korea's capital Seoul is hoping to have 3,500 supercapacitor-powered buses operating by 2020, and they're also being used in Shanghai, China. European car maker PSA Peugeot Citroen has been using them in its cars since 2010 - supercapacitor maker Maxwell Technologies says more than a million vehicles now incorporate its products. But to date, supercapacitors haven't been very good at holding much power or holding on to that power for very long. This poor energy density, as it's called, the amount of power they can hold per kilogramme, has put them at a significant disadvantage to li-ion batteries. More Technology of Business\n\"The two main advantages of conventional supercapacitors over batteries are their ability to handle much higher charge and discharge rates, and their longer cycle life,\" says Gareth Hinds, Fellow of the UK's National Physical Laboratory. \"The downside is that they tend to be relatively high cost and can only store a few seconds-, or at most, minutes-worth of power.\" This isn't a problem when your supercapacitor is being used to power a tool on a factory assembly line, for example. It can be recharged in seconds once it's placed back in its charging dock. But it is if you're in an electric car or bus that needs recharging every few miles. Taavi Madiberk, chief executive and co-founder of Skeleton Technologies, a supercapacitor maker based in Estonia, Germany and Finland, says his products incorporate layers of graphene - a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice - and other carbon-based materials in its supercapacitors. These layers have a huge surface area - just 1g of graphene can cover 2,000 sq m, says Mr Madiberk. This allows them to hold on to a lot more power. His firm's products are already used in hybrid vehicles, particularly buses and lorries. In one experiment, they installed supercapacitors in a Sainsbury's supermarket diesel-electric delivery van and \"achieved 32% fuel savings\", says Mr Madiberk. But he acknowledges that in the short-term, combining supercapacitors with li-ion batteries is probably the best way to enjoy the best of both worlds, particularly in electric vehicles. Ulrik Grape, chief executive of NaWa technologies, another supercapacitor maker based in the South of France, agrees, saying: \"Supercapacitors don't store as much energy but their response is instantaneous. So a supercapacitor could handle acceleration and energy recovery under braking - taking care of the stressful part of a battery's life - possibly doubling or tripling a battery's life expectancy.\" NaWa's technology involves electrodes made from \"vertically aligned carbon and graphene nanotubes that can store the energy on the surface of these tubes,\" explains Mr Grape. These tubes, which are coated with another carbon-based material, are so tiny you can fit 10 billion of them in a square centimetre. As carbon is a light material, incorporating supercapacitors into li-ion batteries would also reduce the overall weight, and this would improve the range performance of an electric vehicle. A Formula E racing car's battery, currently made by Williams Advanced Engineering, weighs 300kg, but this could be reduced by a third to 200kg, NaWa believes, without any loss of range. \"We think the ability to charge and discharge a battery fast will be one of the most important things in the future,\" says Mr Grape. \"We don't have as much energy as a lithium-ion battery but we can do many more cycles - charges and discharges - up to a million. Carbon is such a robust material.\" By contrast, a normal battery, which relies on chemical reactions to create electricity, eventually wears out once those chemicals lose their potency - after about 3,000 to 5,000 cycles of charging and discharging. Another advantage of supercapacitors, makers say, is that they don't require rare materials, such as cobalt. Of course, supercapacitors don't mean the end of traditional batteries by any means. Li-ion technology is still being improved by about 5-10% each year. New forms of energy storage will be critical to the success of renewable energy as a replacement for fossil fuels. When the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow, we'll need to access stored energy very quickly to plug the gap. As well as traditional energy storage methods, such as pumped hydro, flywheels, compressed gas and large battery arrays, highly efficient supercapacitors could eventually become a crucial component in a fully sustainable energy network. But these are early days. \"Polymer-based supercapacitors are emerging as a promising technology,\" concludes Gareth Hinds, \"but there is a lot of work still to do to achieve the required energy storage capacity without compromising on power, lifetime and cost.\" ",

        "content": "A hundred years ago, teams of women were playing in front of large crowds and making big money. Then the Football Association banned them from its grounds. Here's the story of the fall and rise of women's football, told through 10 objects collected by the National Football Museum. \"Complaints having been made as to football being played by women, the [FA] council feel impelled to express their strong opinion that the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and ought not to be encouraged. Complaints have also been made as to the conditions under which some of these matches have been arranged and played, and the appropriation of receipts to other than charitable objects.\" With these words in 1921, the FA decided to ban the playing of women's football in FA-member grounds, which strangled the game as a successful business as the stricture remained in place for 50 years. In other countries there were outright bans on women playing. Jean Williams, the University of Wolverhampton's professor of sport, takes us through items which show the business history and struggles of the women's game. 1. 1895 Sketch magazine print of Nettie Honeyball 'in her football costume'\n\"In 1863 we get the formation of the Football Association and of the modern game. The first women's football games that we know about are in 1881, and they are professional games played to large audiences and they make money. It seems they are organised by local businessmen. The 1881-82 games are relatively short lived. \"Nettie Honeyball is the secretary and captain of the first British Ladies Football Club, which was founded in 1894. She was a middle class woman, and they had a non-playing president Lady Florence Dixie, who was upper class. \"In historic terms this was the first time women organised football for women. The first game was in Crouch End in 1895 before 10,000 people, which must have generated healthy receipts. Hundreds of games follow in the next few years and the women's game is played all over Britain.\" 2. Wheaties cereal box from the 1990s featuring US player Michelle Akers\n\"In the 1991 women's world championship she was the winner of the golden boot. She was the first real international women's football star and was massive in the US. She paved the way for Mia Hamm and Hope Solo, but interestingly one of the things that constricted her potential success was that she suffered from chronic fatigue disorder. But for that, her international profile could have been much more. \"The narrative of the Wheaties box is that she has had challenges to overcome but is still achieving and can't be held back. This is all referred to on the packaging of the cereal, which the manufacturers call 'The Breakfast of Champions'. \"It is one of the first commercial endorsements of this type in the 1990s, at a time when Fifa finally decided they were going to actively oversee women's football, having taken over its stewardship in 1971 but not doing much to promote it in the intervening years.\" 3. Programmes from 1950s women's football matches\n\"The crux of the FA's ban is that it does not ban women's football outright, but stops it being played on member clubs' grounds. Before the ban women's football is an entertainment spectacle, and if you play it in enclosed stadiums then you can charge people money to come in and watch. \"Once the ban comes in women's football goes to other venues: to rugby league and cricket grounds, as well as other venues. These programmes show games being played at Belle Vue speedway stadium, Manchester, and at a general sports stadium on the Isle of Man. \"But the FA puts pressure on other sports not to host women's games, which destroys the business model of the women's game. And that gives growth to the myth that women's football has never been an entertaining commercial spectacle. The game is still finding its way back from the ban.\" 4. Christie and Barbie football dolls\n\"These dolls were released for sale before the 1999 Women's World Cup by toymaker Mattel. The goalkeeper of that team was Briana Scurry.\" [The first woman goalkeeper and first black woman to be elected to the US National Soccer Hall of Fame.] \"But more generally, it reflects [the fact] that the American consumer market was sensitive and aware of questions of ethnicity and race. The marketing of the dolls was as diverse and inclusive as it could be. \"There was obviously already an established business around the Barbie and Christie brands, but such was the growing marketing power of women's football that a major manufacturer thought it could cash in further around the 1999 World Cup.\" 5. Shirt from Eniola Aluko's debut, England v Netherlands, 2004\n\"The business significance is that major manufacturer Umbro produced the shirt. Historically, sporting brands have not created consumer markets in women's football replica wear in the same way that they have done in other sports, particularly the high-fashion ones of tennis and golf. \"It is only relatively recently that that sporting brands have released football shirts cut for women, or boots specifically made for female feet. However, while these other aspects of women's football shirts have progressed, what is interesting is that often the shirt sponsors within the game are not of such 'high brand value' as the men's game. \"There is a real opportunity out there for brands such as cosmetics firms to sponsor women's football teams, but you get brands like Nivea preferring to partner with the Liverpool men's football team.\" 6. A ticket from the 1991 Women's World Championship with sponsor\n\"This ticket, being sponsored by M&Ms, shows that a major US confectionery brand was using women's football to try and crack the potential new business market of China. The tournament was played for the M&Ms Cup. Meanwhile, China wanted to establish a commercial relationship with the West. \"There were seven sponsors of this first official women's global tournament in 1991, which Fifa interestingly, and tentatively, called a 'world championship' and not a World Cup. Fifa wanted to get into China and China wanted to join the world football family, so to test the waters this low-financial-risk event was drawn up. \"The event was a sporting success and also a successful media product, it was sold to TV companies around the world, and it showed full stadia for the women's game.\" 7. Ball and boots of the type worn by 1920s/30s star Lily Parr\n\"Lily Parr was the star of the Dick, Kerr Ladies football team of Preston. She began playing for the team at 14, and played for them for 20 years. There are various reports of Lily receiving 'broken time payments', that is, financial compensation for amateur players for time they had had to take off from their day jobs. These women players were nurses, munitions workers, and so on. \"These payments, with her earnings from nursing, enabled her to become the first person in her family to own their own home. Obviously this all relates to the ban of 1921 as the FA decides too much of the charitable funds from women's matches are being used for player expenses. They were meant to be amateurs but the financial arrangements could be described as at best opaque. \"The boots and ball are from her era. She was a left winger, then moved back into defence and ended her career in goal.\" 8. Poster for an unofficial Women's World Cup in 1970\n\"There were two unofficial Women's World Cups held in the early 1970s: one in Italy in 1970 and one in Mexico a year later, both backed by local business interests and played in major football stadiums. \"In Mexico the event definitely looked to piggyback the men's World Cup held in the country the previous year. That would explain the commercialisation of the women's event there, which was considerable, with key rings, badges, programmes and other consumables produced, and a lot of coverage in the local press. The final was played in the Azteca Stadium in front of 110,000. \"The Italian event was sponsored by Italian multinational drinks brand Martini & Rossi, and its final was held in the Turin's Stadio Communale in front of 40,000.\" [Denmark defeated the host nations in both finals]. 9. Postcard of Dick, Kerr Ladies FC (1920s)\n\"Dick, Kerr wanted to be known as the best in the world, but also wanted to plug into the success of the local men's team and the civic notion of Proud Preston. They had a regular paying public who supported them financially at weekends but also at pioneering floodlit matches. \"Most of the crowds at their games are local working-class men. When we think we are being progressive by following women's football, it was these men who were coming out to support the team week in, week out. \"This commercially-produced postcard is evidence of 'ambient marketing', typical of how the team's fame spread beyond their home town to a much wider audience. Newsreel films and magazine articles will also have spread their name further afield.\" 10. Art deco statuette of a female footballer\n\"Because women's football has always been topical, representing modernity, assertive female physicality, and - in its early days - played solely to raise large sums of money, its broader representation has always been culturally significant. \"So artefacts, collectables, disposable items, ephemera, have been created around the game over the decades. This statuette is an example of a stylised female football player that someone would have had in their home. It is 1920s in appearance. \"There were a lot of similar models made around women's boxing and athletics; beautified art deco creations.\" Professor Williams has organised Upfront and Onside: The Women's Football Conference, about the history and heritage of women's football to be held at the National Football Museum in Manchester on International Women's Day, 8 March, and the following day.

        "content": "This year's Oscar ceremony won't go down in history as one of the most surprising ever - perhaps a good thing after last year's best picture mix-up. Most of the people who were expected to win awards won them, while the awards were evenly distributed between the main films in contention. And despite references to #MeToo and Harvey Weinstein, it didn't feel as political as the Golden Globes with its red carpet black-out. Yet there were themes that ran through the ceremony, repeated by different winners in different categories. Here are the four main threads: 1. Persistence pays off\nSome people get Oscars for their first film. But for some, it takes longer - quite a bit longer, in fact. On Sunday we saw James Ivory win his very first Oscar, for adapted screenplay, for the gorgeous yet heartbreaking coming-of-age romance Call Me By Your Name. At 89, he's the oldest person to ever take home one of the coveted gold statues - and it sounds like it was worth the wait. He told the press room: \"I mean, being 90 years for anything that you would do is extraordinary. \"But to be here having won the Oscar at that age, this seems like a hiccup in nature. But it feels great.\" Then we had British cinematographer Roger Deakins, finally winning an Oscar after being nominated a stonking 14 times. In the end, it was his work on Blade Runner 2049 that earned him the award. It was actually Allison Janney's first Oscars, and her first win - something she once thought was simply not going to happen for her. \"I didn't dare to dream of things like this, because I didn't want to be disappointed,\" she said. \"At a certain point, I'd given up on something like this happening to me.\" And while Jordan Peele won the Oscar for best original screenplay for Get Out, he had quit writing it 20 times. Yes, 20 times. But he persevered. The message there? Don't give up and dare to dream. 2. The future looks bright\nThis year's Oscars may have been devoid of the drama that categorised last year - possibly thanks to a larger font being used on the envelopes. Neither was it a politically-charged year for the Academy Awards, with no #OscarsSoWhite this time around. But it did feel like there was a change in the air: a sense of new kinds of films being recognised, made by people who might have previously been passed over by the Oscars. That's quite likely due to the change in the make-up of the voting Academy in recent years. Jordan Peele put it well by saying there was a \"renaissance\" in film. It was like a baton was being passed too, when Gary Oldman paid tribute to the skills of fellow best actor nominee Timothee Chalamet - telling the young actor he'd be back and that his time for an Oscar would come. Meanwhile, The Shape of Water director Guillermo del Toro offered a challenge to aspiring film-makers. \"I want to tell you - everyone who is dreaming of\u2026 using genre or fantasy to tell stories about the things that are real in the world today, you can do it,\" he said as he picked up the award for best picture. \"This is a door - kick it open and come in.\" 3. 'Representation matters'\nThat line came from the inspiring speech given by Lee Unkrich, producer of Disney/Pixar's charming Day of the Dead animation Coco. He said his biggest thanks went to Mexico, and that the film could not have existed without its \"endlessly beautiful culture and traditions\". \"With Coco, we tried to take a step forward toward a world where all children can grow up seeing characters in movies that look and talk and live like they do,\" he told the audience. \"Marginalised people deserve to feel like they belong. Representation matters.\" It was an Oscars where representation seemed to matter, more than perhaps ever before. It was on stage in the form of Daniela Vega, the first transgender actress to present. (The film she stars in, A Fantastic Woman, also won best foreign film.) And it was present when del Toro won best director and best picture. Frances McDormand made a point of forcing the Oscars to stare representation in the face by asking female nominees to stand up. And Rachel Shenton and Chris Overton spoke of the importance of their short film, The Silent Child, in representing deafness. There's still a long way to go, with only one woman having won a best director Oscar - an award that's yet to go to a black director. But it feels like a start. 4. Snacks are key...\nIt might seem like the stuff of dreams - or of nightmares, depending on how you feel about hot dogs. But giant plastic hot dog cannons that you fire actual hot dogs out of are real, they exist, and they formed a key part of a skit during the Oscars show. Jimmy Kimmel got celebrities including Gal Gadot, Margot Robbie and Emily Blunt to take a quick trip across the road to a nearby cinema, where an unsuspecting audience were watching a preview of A Wrinkle in Time. There they provided snacks to the surprised members of the public. But the highlight was surely Armie Hammer and Ansel Elgort armed with hot dog cannons. \"This is better than the Oscars!\" Gadot exclaimed. In addition to being showered with hot dogs, host Jimmy Kimmel surprised the audience at the Dolby Theatre with snack boxes full of crisps, Gummy bears, chocolate, granola bars and - thoughtfully - Listerine strips. \"It wouldn't be right to make you sit through this without snacks,\" a note inside the boxes read, adding: \"Please don't throw them at me.\" We don\u2019t like it when people are hungry \u2013 so we provided lunchboxes with snacks for everyone at the #Oscars and included a donation to the @LAFoodBank for each one. https://t.co/Epp3SmGQAi #WeFeedLA @ThisBar #ThisBarSavesLives @WolfgangPuck @TheAcademy pic.twitter.com/x5LG0KbTk4 End of Twitter post by @JimmyKimmelLive The boxes were themed around the best picture nominations and contained original artwork portraying each film.

And it didn't pass him by when the Conservatives tweeted during the speech. It's not the first time a speech by the prime minister has been overshadowed by what's going on behind her. At the Conservative Party conference in 2017, her backdrop began to fall apart as she was speaking. This speech saw Mrs May point her finger at developers, who she said have a \"perverse\" financial incentive to hoard land once it had been approved for development rather than actually build on it. \"I want to see planning permissions going to people who are actually going to build houses, not just sit on land and watch its value rise,\" she said. \"I expect developers to do their duty to Britain and build the homes our country needs.\" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

        "content": "Six months after the worst hurricane in living memory brought devastation to the Caribbean, there are still UK citizens sleeping in a government shelter with nowhere to call home. In the middle of a basketball gymnasium, Stanton \"Mikey\" Robinson, 30, sat with all of his worldly possessions. Fighting back tears he explained his dream of having a small apartment with a small table and a single bed. \"I don't like it in here. I don't feel comfortable in this place,\" he told us. \"(tell the government to) Please help me.\" Twenty metres away on what's meant to be spectator seating, Makeba Hesky, 34, sat nursing her 10-month-old child. A large hole - unpatched since the hurricane - in the roof of the BVI Sports Complex allowed rain and light to pour into the otherwise unlit gymnasium. \"It seems to me like everybody just give up on us,\" Hesky said. Hesky and Robinson are among the approximately 20 people still living in the shelter who have faced repeated deadlines to move out despite nowhere to go. Many more are living with friends and family. Outside the sports complex and across the islands, signs of Irma's (destructive) visit can still be seen everywhere - not least at the island's government building. Most of the structure's windows are boarded, awaiting replacement. Inside, the island's premier, Orlando Smith, works from a sparse office while repairmen are still labouring to repair the extensive damage. Asked if he could guarantee that those in the shelter would not be thrown out with nowhere to go, Smith told the BBC, \"that's why they're still there\u2026 we're looking to provide the necessary accommodation for them\". The \"biggest priority is housing - getting those roofs back on, getting people in homes,\" he said, speaking outside his office. \"Then of course, there is the matter of the economy. We've got to get that economy back up and running.\" Economically speaking, the islands' tourism sector took the biggest hit. Few know that better than Roselyn Hill. She like many others here worked in the tourism industry for decades, only to be laid off when Irma damaged the resorts and attractions at which they worked. \"Peak season a couple of years ago - sometimes it looks like more boats than water. You can't see the water for the yachts,\" she said, standing on a cruise ship dock that (now lies) laid empty. Two of the biggest cruise companies have stopped bringing ships to the BVI, and the reduced numbers of tourists has meant a slow recovery for the tourism industry. \"It's not a good feeling you know back then to compare it to now,\" she said. \"When we see a cruise ship, it's like light\". The hardships have caused many to question whether the United Kingdom did enough to support those on the islands. Across town, Rita Plunkett was doing her washing on a day off. Stepping inside, she explained how windows and doors to her home were broken during the storm and pointed to massive water damage to a bedroom ceiling. On the roof of her apartment building, bits of UK Aid-branded tarpaulin stood between her and regular rainstorms. She said the UK's response came up short. She received, \"no aid, apart from the six bottles of water I got - that was it,\" she said. It was a common perception we have heard here over the past few days - that other than the work done by British troops in the month after the storm, more could have been done. Upon returning from a preaching trip to the island of Virgin Gorda, Bishop John Cline went a step further than most we spoke with. \"When we did need them to show that we are truly a child of the United Kingdom, I think they disappointed us,\" he said. \"It changed our view in terms of a relationship, to saying 'are we really a part of you or is that just in name only?'\" But the island's British governor, Gus Jaspert, says he's proud of the UK's contribution to the BVI's recovery - noting that much of Britain's work has been behind-the-scenes. \"(Together) we've got the electricity back on. We've got businesses back open. We've got all children getting educated, and key services are back up and running,\" he said, noting that much work still remained. The governor is right about progress being made. Given the scale of the destruction even removing debris has been a huge feat, albeit one that is still ongoing. The island's main high school lies in ruin. Many other schools appear damaged. Harbours are littered with overturned and abandoned boats - some boats lay where they washed up on land. Roads are littered with potholes. And some debris remains strewn about. And now, with hurricane season less than 100 days away, many island residents are worried about what the next storm may bring.

        "content": "When Hannah Price was sexually assaulted as a student, she felt unable to report it. She has since discovered she is far from alone - and that sexual assault may be far more common on campus than official figures suggest. I don't remember being taught about consent at school, other than \"No means no.\" What I do remember is being told not to walk home on my own, or I'd risk being raped by a stranger in a dark alley. But when I was raped it was not in the street, but in my own student house, and I had taken the precaution of being walked home by someone I knew. It was the first social event of that academic year at the University of Bristol and it had been a fun night. It was everyone's favourite time of term - lectures had not properly begun and deadlines were still far from our minds. I drank, laughed and danced until I was ready for sleep. As I was leaving the club, a guy also at the social said he lived near me and offered to walk me home. Walking home alone, late at night, in the dark was something I actively tried to avoid, so I gladly accepted his offer. We'd only met a few weeks before, so conversation was light - we chatted about the night and what to expect in the new term. When we got to the steps that led up to my house, he politely asked if he could pop inside for a glass of water because he was feeling unwell. Maybe this is when I should have heard alarm bells, but even as I was pouring the drink in my kitchen nothing struck me as amiss. Not until after he'd finished the water, and the pretence was over. With his first demand to go to my room, came my first rebuff - my first spoken \"No.\" To this day, it still strikes me how a charming disguise can so quickly disperse, and turn into aggression. Despite my refusal to go to my bedroom, and my repeated attempts to get him to leave, he was relentless: \"Why would you let me in if you didn't want something to happen?\" The more I said I wasn't interested, the more forceful he became. I lost count of how many times I said \"No\". And then suddenly there was someone physically stronger than me, refusing to leave until he got what he wanted. His hand grabbed my arm so fiercely that it became instantly clear that his intentions had never been to get me home safely. It is a strange feeling, being so paralysed by fear in your own living room. In that moment, I realised saying \"No\" wasn't going to be enough. He took off my tights. When he was done he finally left. The next day I locked myself in my room, only leaving to shower away the reminders of the night before. I lay there overwhelmed with disgust, self-blame and guilt. You may also be interested in:\nI never reported what happened to anyone in authority. Who would believe me if I did? I had been drinking. I let him into my house. I didn't physically try to fight him off - fear took over. Surely that meant it was my fault? What happened didn't fit any label that I recognised: he wasn't a stranger, there was no dark alley. I knew I would have to see him again. I was in a student bubble, studying and socialising with my peers - even at an institution as big as my university was, bumping into someone is inevitable. And because of his charismatic public persona and popularity it seemed easier, and less traumatic, to suppress what had happened, than face up to it. This was my first time living independently. There was no-one I felt I could turn to at the university. I worried that what happened wasn't \"serious enough\" to be believed or taken seriously. The university's policy stated that if you were reporting what was a criminal offence they couldn't and wouldn't do anything until it had been dealt with by the police. But I was wary of going to the police. The year before, I had reported another student to the police for attacking me in a nightclub. There were witnesses and CCTV evidence - nevertheless, the fallout was hugely stressful. I was alienated from some of my friends. I had to deal with the anxiety about running into that student on a daily basis - my mental and physical health quickly declined. Multiply that by 100 and that is what I imagined reporting my sexual assault to the police would be like. Help and advice\nThe process for sexual assault can take ages. How would my studies be affected by a serious criminal investigation and trial? The likelihood of bumping into my perpetrator wouldn't reduce over that time, so would I even be safe? There would also be the embarrassment and fear of being shamed and the added doubt that our mutual friends might not even believe me, and accuse me of ruining someone's life. So I told no-one, I saw him all the time and forced myself to pretend that it was nothing. But every now and then there would be glimpses to remind me of what happened - moments where he would stand a little too close or persistently message me late at night. That night was over three years ago. Yet, it wasn't until this summer, when I was done with my degree and had left university that I was able to acknowledge to myself, and others, that I was raped. And I'm not alone. What's shocking is how many other stories there are like mine. As a student journalist, I searched for a long time for a way to bring this issue of sexual assault and harassment on campus into the spotlight but, like me, no-one was comfortable enough to speak out publicly. After reading an article about two incredibly brave rape survivors in India who maintained their anonymity by using social media, Snapchat suddenly seemed like the perfect fit - it's an innovative and modern platform that millennials are familiar with. The app's facial and voice-disguising software allows each participant to disguise their identity to the level they're comfortable with, while capturing their raw emotion and strength. And so I founded a campaign, Revolt Sexual Assault, to expose the real nature and extent of sexual assault and harassment experienced by former and current students at university in the UK, and call for policy reforms to address this problem. I've now heard countless stories of sexual violence from brave students - each of which has been incredibly powerful and impossible to forge. Beneath the filters, you can see the deep and long-lasting effects that these assaults have had on survivors. Part of the problem is that people don't recognise sexual assault and harassment when it happens - because it happens so much. Since I was of secondary school-age I've been cat-called at bus stops - men twice my age would shout out what they would like to do to me and my friends. Passers-by didn't bat an eyelid, so soon I didn't either - it was \"normal\". I've been looked up and down like a piece of meat, I've left train carriages and bars because of how uncomfortable I was made to feel, and been told I deserved it for how I was dressed. In broad daylight, on my way to the library, I was groped in the street. In my second year, when someone grabbed my bum in a club and I told them that that was sexual assault, I was met with laughter - and in another case, a punch in the face. I've listened to women almost casually open up to experiences of waking up in the night to someone having sex with them, while they had been unconscious - and then go on to rationalise their rapists' actions, truly believing it was their fault for going home with that boy, or for drinking too much. The sad reality is that the more students I listen to through Revolt Sexual Assault, the same themes emerge: students like me are suffering in silence, blaming themselves and having their student years spoilt because of sexual violence and the lack of support available from universities. But there is very little data available. Universities themselves record very low numbers of sexual assault and harassment. That's why, in partnership with The Student Room, an online student community, we launched the first national survey on this issue in a decade. The number of responses to the online survey suggests that this problem is widespread. It's easy to dismiss these statistics because the sample was self-selected and depended on individuals choosing to answer, but behind the numbers there are young people with real stories to tell. We gave students the option to expand on their answers, and thousands felt strongly enough to do so. Reading each of these accounts was heartbreaking. But the most telling results for me were how few respondents felt they had received the help they needed. Many young people experiencing sexual violence in the UK don't feel supported enough by their universities to go to the police, or to ask for help. Why? Now that movements such as Me Too and Time's Up have had such an impact, it's time to have a conversation about sexual violence on campus. Since I first wrote about my own experience, trolls have criticised my story, victim-blamed me, called me an attention seeker, a liar and a slut, devalued my feelings, belittled my campaign and accused me of ruining my attacker's life (though I have never named him). But I have already done these things to myself. Thousands of young people like me have done them to themselves. And this is why a change in culture is so important. I've had the pleasure of meeting some of the strongest, most amazing people through my work at Revolt Sexual Assault. I am in awe of their decision to trust me with their stories. It is thanks to them that I have come to terms with what happened to me. Mark Ames, Director of Student Services at the University of Bristol, said: We're sorry to hear that Hannah felt unable to report the sexual assault or reach out for any support. The welfare of all our students is vitally important to us and we have a zero-tolerance approach to sexual harassment and clear policies are in place to deal with complaints. Specialist staff, including staff within our student counselling and health services, are trained to respond to incidents of sexual assault and refer students to specialist external agencies such as The Bridge, Bristol's Sexual Assault Referral Centre. We realise that it can be difficult for students to report these issues. To make this process easier, we are launching an online 'Report and Support' portal this year for survivors of sexual violence and other forms of harassment. We are also introducing major new investments in wellbeing in our academic schools, in central services such as our student counselling and health services, and a review of pastoral support in our halls to provide 24/7 support from staff who are on duty rather than on call.

        "content": "Lego's latest set of annual numbers showed its first drop-off in profits and revenues for 13 years this week. After the Danish toy-maker turned itself around more than a decade ago, last year it failed to click with customers. It said it had produced too many bricks, and had to sell off excess stock at a discount. How can Lego have too many bricks? Isn't it just that it didn't manage to sell the sets it had produced?\nIn a way, yes. Every year it forecasts how much Lego it thinks it will need to manage its production, and last year its forecast wasn't on the money. Though to be fair, for the previous 13 years it has consistently underestimated how much it would need to produce, and hasn't made enough stock, says Frederique Tutt, global toy industry analyst at the NPD Group. Euromonitor toy analyst Matthew Hudak says \"a big issue is that Lego has now is that it's grown so quickly with only one product that it inevitably had slow down and hit a wall.\" Lego says its consumer sales in 2017 were flat, but it \"started 2017 with a higher than optimal levels of inventories\". \"The amount of Lego parents bought in 2017 was consistent with the prior year. However, because we sold fewer sets to retailers as we cleaned up inventories, revenues declined,\" it says. Has Lego lost its imagination? Are the pieces getting too specific?\nIt's a bit harsh to say Lego has lost its imagination, says Ms Tutt. The toy industry like every other is cyclical, and after 13 years it's \"fair enough to say it can have a rest\", she says. As for the pieces being too specific, she says today's children \"like to be taken by the hand\" rather than being given a set of generic blocks, and that themed sets have been \"a driver of success\" for Lego. However, in 2017 there \"was a bit too much of Star Wars, not just in Lego, but everywhere\", she says. After three years of successive marketing the market was slightly saturated, she says. In addition, there's \"not a lot of evidence that a toy company can lean too much on licensing as licensed toys are growing quite a bit globally,\" says Mr Hudak. \"The high proliferation of smartphones allows children to watch their favourite shows all the time, which is growing demand for more licensed products,\" he says. Lego says it hasn't run out of imagination. \"Only one out of five top selling themes in 2017 was licenced. That was Star Wars. The other themes were those created by our own talented designers.\" Is Lego too expensive?\nLego is more expensive than its direct competitors, but Ms Tutt says its quality is higher. It doesn't tend to use promotions that much because it doesn't have to, she says. As for permanently reducing price to stimulate sales - \"I don't think Lego wants to go that way\", she says. Lego pays licensing for sets that are linked to blockbuster brands such as Star Wars. That cost is directly passed on to consumers, making those sets more expensive. Lego says: \"We believe Lego products are unique and deliver great value for money. In addition, our products meet the highest safety and quality standards and last for generations.\" Has Lego failed to keep up with 2017 trends?\n\"Households can have too many Lego products and not want more each year, and equally important is that children have fickle tastes, and simply lose interest in Lego,\" says Mr Hudak. One of the big trends in 2017 in toys was \"collectibles\" - that is, toys that can be built up into a set. Whereas the year before Lego was more fashionable, in 2017 the focus was on toys such as Lol Surprise! Dolls, says Ms Tutt. However, in terms of what it does, Lego remains the market leader, with about two thirds of the global market in \"construction toys\", says Euromonitor. There was also a general slowdown in the toy market in the UK as people's disposable income was squeezed by higher inflation and low wage growth, Ms Tutt adds. Lego says: \"We launched some great products in 2017. In addition to our top-selling themes such as Lego City, Lego Friends and Lego Duplo, we introduced new play experiences inspired by the latest digital trends.\" Who are Lego's main customers?\nBoys aged between 5 and 9. The company has been diversifying towards trying to attract more girls, but boys (or more specifically, their parents, relations, and people with disposable income buying for them) remain the core customers, Ms Tutt says. There are Lego sets aimed at adult collectors, such as a Beatles Yellow Submarine, but these are more niche, says Ms Tutt. Lego's largest markets are the US, Western Europe - specifically UK, Germany, and France - and China, says Mr Hudak. Could Lego start using reclaimed plastic to help recycling efforts?\nIn a word, no, at least not soon. The type of plastic Lego uses is acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) which is tough to recycle. Reclaimed plastic would not be of a high enough quality. Lego is trying to move towards using more sustainable materials - it recently announced that it is moving towards using \"plant-based polyethylene\" from sugar cane. This is still a hard-wearing plastic. As children become more environmentally aware, Lego is likely to continue to get greener, says Ms Tutt. Lego says: \"We have set ourselves an ambitious target to make our bricks from sustainable sources by 2030... We are also working on developing new materials. Use of recycled materials presents many challenges, and to ensure that the product safety and quality is not compromised we are currently working on finding the right solution for using recycled materials in our products.\" ",

        "content": "Theresa May has said the government is looking at arrangements between the US and Canada as a possible solution to the Irish border issue. How close is the comparison? What did the prime minister say?\nLabour MP Emma Reynolds asked Theresa May to give an example of a border between two countries which are not in a customs union, but do not have checks on lorries crossing the frontier. Mrs May said: \"There are many examples of different arrangements for customs around the rest of the world. \"Indeed we are looking at those, including for example the border between the United States and Canada.\" Is the US-Canada border a 'soft border'?\nNo. There is a significant amount of infrastructure at major crossings including checkpoints, areas for marshalling lorries and overhead gantries. Lorries are stopped at the border and there are immigration controls. So it would not meet the UK commitment to avoid a 'hard border'?\nNo. The Irish government seems to have anticipated the Canada example. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar visited the border last year. He said it was \"high tech and highly efficient, but make no mistake - it's a hard border\". He reiterated that position on Monday night saying: \"That is definitely not a solution that we can possibly entertain.\" Does it have any relevance to the Irish border?\nIt may be that the UK government believes that some of the technological and administrative arrangements used at the US-Canada border can help solve the problem in Ireland. Brexit Secretary David Davis has also visited the border, specifically the crossing between Detroit and Windsor, which carries a lot of freight traffic between Ford car factories. He spoke enthusiastically to the Exiting the EU Committee about the trusted trader scheme which operates on that border. \"I looked at the crossing times: 54 seconds. I looked at the mechanisms: easy, cheap, 15 years old,\" he said. \"I watched as drivers went through and had to hand over their ID cards, so they knew that they had never been involved in smuggling. \"Even in the most difficult environment, it worked very well.\" Have there been any other feasibility trips to the US-Canada border?\nThe Commons International Trade Committee visited last month. The pro-Brexit Conservative MP Marcus Fysh made an explicit link with the Irish border saying that the need for \"hard\" border gateways on the border itself is driven by immigration \"which shouldn't be needed\" if Ireland remains in a Common Travel Area. He described it as a \"very efficient border\", where inspections can be done well back from border itself. However, a fellow committee member, Labour MP Chris Leslie, drew very different conclusions from the trip. \"It's a hard border and would be devastating between Northern Ireland and the Republic,\" he said. \"More bureaucratic than Dover because each truck has to declare 26 different data elements for 40 different US agencies.\" He described it as \"staggering\" that the prime minister should suggest the US-Canadian border arrangements could be a way forward for the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

        "content": "Counterfeit Xanax pills laced with a powerful painkiller have become a party drug among some young people. Now Public Health England is warning users they are \"dicing with death\". \"I was at a party when a friend shared it with me,\" says Kristello, a 19-year-old rapper from Birmingham, remembering the first time he took Xanax. The drug, also known by the name Alprazolam, is widely prescribed in the US to treat anxiety and can be obtained on private prescription in the UK. But among some teenagers and young adults in the UK it has become a popular recreational drug used illegally. Kristello - who wished to go by his rap name - says his addiction soon grew into a daily habit as he began taking one tablet a night. \"The high felt like it was very floaty, and any worries you had melted away,\" he tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. \"But what you have to take into consideration is what happens after you take Xanax, which is where the problem really starts.\" Nine months ago, after deciding to come off the drug, Kristello struggled sleeping at night and experienced wrenching stomach pains, cold sweats and extreme paranoia. \"It can be really bad on your mental health,\" he says. \"You can experience blackout with memory loss. Your long-term memory can be affected as well.\" Lethal combination\nXanax has previously been glorified by hip hop artists, and is often featured in lyrics. In November 2017, the rapper Lil Peep was found dead after an overdose of Xanax mixed with fentanyl - a powerful synthetic painkiller. It is a lethal combination which, officials say, users risk being repeated when buying counterfeit Xanax online and through street dealers - because they cannot be sure how the drug has been mixed. According to National Crime Agency (NCA) figures, 113 people have died using fentanyl in the last 12 months in the UK. \"The danger we've got here is young people who are used to taking the drug [Xanax] who think they know what they are doing,\" says Tony Saggers, former head of drugs threat at the NCA. \"The great disaster is when these tablets are supplied between friends, and one friend kills another friend because they've sold them something without knowing what it was.\" 'Xanax party'\n\"These are two Xanax bars. I spent \u00a35 for both,\" says 18-year-old \"Kieran\" - not his real name. About twice a month, on a Friday or Saturday night, Kieran and his friends gather for a Xanax \"drug party\" at his one-bedroom flat in Dudley. There are 12 people milling around in his living room. Some are playing PlayStation, drinking alcohol - others are mixing Xanax with other illegal drugs. \"The best way to describe it is you feel like a marshmallow. It's a very chilled drug,\" says Kieran's friend \"Jordan\", also aged 18. Jordan and Kieran - who say they have unintentionally taken counterfeit Xanax spiked with fentanyl in the past - swallow the tiny white pills with alcohol, which makes it even more dangerous. \"I feel really, like, drowsy. I feel a lot like a cloud. I just feel comfortable,\" says Jordan 20 minutes later. When challenged about the potential dangers they are exposing themselves to, both say they are aware of the risks but choose to take it anyway. \"I guess sometimes we see past [the warnings], we don't really think about it. We see on the media people passing away but it doesn't seem to faze anyone really.\" 'Dicing with death'\nExperts say that, despite the warnings, the use of counterfeit Xanax appears to be growing, though there are no figures available to know exactly how widespread its use is. \"It is a real and immediate concern among the young people who it seems to be a drug of choice for,\" says Rosanna O'Connor, Public Health England's head of alcohol, drugs and tobacco. \"People buy things from the internet and they have no guarantee of what they are getting so whatever is in the drugs they buy could change from one drug to another, so they are dicing with death really because these things are dangerous.\" Pfizer, the company that developed Xanax as a prescription drug, said it was \"alarmed\" by the rise of counterfeit versions of Xanax that, it said, have been found to contain acid, heavy metals and even floor polish. A government spokesman said it was \"taking coordinated action to tackle illegal drug use alongside other criminal activity. \"Law enforcement agencies continue to work with internet providers to shut down UK-based websites found to be selling prescription-only medicines illegally. \"Prescription-only medicines are potent and should only be prescribed by a doctor or appropriate healthcare professional.\" Anne McDermott, from Edinburgh, knows all too well the extreme risks associated with the drug. Her son Scott died aged 34 when she says he took Xanax. She believes the substance - which has been linked to a number of deaths across Scotland's capital - is responsible for killing her son in January. \"The first time he took Xanax he was completely out of it. He went back the next day, the next day and the following day, and that's what happened. \"It was an extremely powerful, potent drug.\" Watch the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel.

        "content": "The claim: The body representing developers says that they do not hoard land - they are building houses as quickly as they can. Reality Check verdict: There is currently a large gap between how many planning permissions are granted and how many houses are built. On average over the last decade, government figures show only half of granted planning permissions have resulted in building work being started. But we can't say exactly why developers are doing this - whether it's for profit, because of delays in the planning system or for another reason. The prime minister has said she will tackle the failure to build enough houses in England. As part of this, Theresa May said she would make it harder for developers to hang on to land for which they have been granted planning permission without building on it. Labour's shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne told BBC 5 live at the weekend: \"There are thousands of planning applications that have been granted and yet developers are just sitting on that land - land banking whilst those developments that are chronically needed, just aren't being built.\" But the Home Builders Federation, which represents developers, disputes that this so-called \"land banking\" is happening. Their planning director, Andrew Whitaker, said: \"Having gone to the expense and time of getting a permission, builders cannot afford to sit on it.\" Unused land\nHousing charity Shelter has looked at how quickly developers build. For each year they looked at the gap between planning permission being granted, building work starting, and completing. They allowed an 18-month gap between permission being granted and starting building, and another 18 months between building work starting and completing. On average between 2006 and 2014 in England, fewer than 45% of all planning permissions granted were started and fewer than 50% completed. That suggests that half of all planning permission applications don't result in building activity at all. The problem is, this doesn't tell us why developers are sitting on the land. It also doesn't mean these projects will never be built. One key reason that developers might wait is so they have a \"pipeline\" of land to develop on in the future. Dan Lewis, a senior infrastructure advisor at the Institute of Directors, says: \"The last thing you want to do if you are a housing company is develop all your land at once, because then you'll go bankrupt.\" Government review\nAs numbers of permissions granted have gone up, house building has not kept pace meaning the gap between permissions and housing supply has grown considerably. This is something the government is already looking into as part of a review headed up by Conservative MP Sir Oliver Letwin. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government says that as of July 2016, just over half the 684,000 homes with planning permission had been completed. Analysis from the Local Government Association, which represents local councils, found last year there were 423,544 unimplemented planning permissions. But a Home Builders Federation spokesman said these permissions are measured \"at the point when the first condition is discharged but some permissions have 100-plus conditions attached that take months or years to discharge before builders are actually allowed to start building\". He added: \"So a lot of the 'permissions' are stuck making their way through the planning system via understaffed local authority planning departments.\" 'Pipeline'\nCritics say developers hold on to land as an asset. Instead of building on it, once developers have been granted planning permission they may be able to sell that land on at a profit to be developed by someone else. Shelter accepts that these figures are not necessarily all because developers are speculating for profit. But nevertheless their figures point clearly to the fact that there is land which is available for house building, on which houses have not yet been built. The cause of this delay, however, is harder to pin down. ",

        "content": "Imagine being able to charge your electric car in minutes rather than hours, or your smartphone in seconds. That's the enticing prospect being touted by researchers who reckon they've discovered a new material that could boost the performance of a carbon-based supercapacitor - sometimes called an ultracapacitor - a type of energy storage device that can be charged very quickly and offload its power very quickly, too. Dr Donald Highgate, director of research at Superdielectrics Ltd, says a material he originally developed for soft contact lenses is also surprisingly good at holding an electrostatic field. Very simply, supercapacitors don't produce electricity through chemical reactions as conventional batteries do, they create these electrostatic fields. Dr Highgate is working with Bristol and Surrey universities to develop supercapacitors using the new polymer and hopes that they could eventually rival, or even surpass, lithium-ion (li-ion) batteries - so long as they manage to replicate prototype performance on a large scale. So far, supercapacitors have been good at providing quick bursts of power - to start a car engine, for example, or to give trains a boost when accelerating. They're also well-suited to harvesting energy from vehicles when they brake, making them an important component in electric vehicles. And national electricity grids use them to provide quick power top-ups when balancing supply and demand. South Korea's capital Seoul is hoping to have 3,500 supercapacitor-powered buses operating by 2020, and they're also being used in Shanghai, China. European car maker PSA Peugeot Citroen has been using them in its cars since 2010 - supercapacitor maker Maxwell Technologies says more than a million vehicles now incorporate its products. But to date, supercapacitors haven't been very good at holding much power or holding on to that power for very long. This poor energy density, as it's called, the amount of power they can hold per kilogramme, has put them at a significant disadvantage to li-ion batteries. More Technology of Business\n\"The two main advantages of conventional supercapacitors over batteries are their ability to handle much higher charge and discharge rates, and their longer cycle life,\" says Gareth Hinds, Fellow of the UK's National Physical Laboratory. \"The downside is that they tend to be relatively high cost and can only store a few seconds-, or at most, minutes-worth of power.\" This isn't a problem when your supercapacitor is being used to power a tool on a factory assembly line, for example. It can be recharged in seconds once it's placed back in its charging dock. But it is if you're in an electric car or bus that needs recharging every few miles. Taavi Madiberk, chief executive and co-founder of Skeleton Technologies, a supercapacitor maker based in Estonia, Germany and Finland, says his products incorporate layers of graphene - a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice - and other carbon-based materials in its supercapacitors. These layers have a huge surface area - just 1g of graphene can cover 2,000 sq m, says Mr Madiberk. This allows them to hold on to a lot more power. His firm's products are already used in hybrid vehicles, particularly buses and lorries. In one experiment, they installed supercapacitors in a Sainsbury's supermarket diesel-electric delivery van and \"achieved 32% fuel savings\", says Mr Madiberk. But he acknowledges that in the short-term, combining supercapacitors with li-ion batteries is probably the best way to enjoy the best of both worlds, particularly in electric vehicles. Ulrik Grape, chief executive of NaWa technologies, another supercapacitor maker based in the South of France, agrees, saying: \"Supercapacitors don't store as much energy but their response is instantaneous. So a supercapacitor could handle acceleration and energy recovery under braking - taking care of the stressful part of a battery's life - possibly doubling or tripling a battery's life expectancy.\" NaWa's technology involves electrodes made from \"vertically aligned carbon and graphene nanotubes that can store the energy on the surface of these tubes,\" explains Mr Grape. These tubes, which are coated with another carbon-based material, are so tiny you can fit 10 billion of them in a square centimetre. As carbon is a light material, incorporating supercapacitors into li-ion batteries would also reduce the overall weight, and this would improve the range performance of an electric vehicle. A Formula E racing car's battery, currently made by Williams Advanced Engineering, weighs 300kg, but this could be reduced by a third to 200kg, NaWa believes, without any loss of range. \"We think the ability to charge and discharge a battery fast will be one of the most important things in the future,\" says Mr Grape. \"We don't have as much energy as a lithium-ion battery but we can do many more cycles - charges and discharges - up to a million. Carbon is such a robust material.\" By contrast, a normal battery, which relies on chemical reactions to create electricity, eventually wears out once those chemicals lose their potency - after about 3,000 to 5,000 cycles of charging and discharging. Another advantage of supercapacitors, makers say, is that they don't require rare materials, such as cobalt. Of course, supercapacitors don't mean the end of traditional batteries by any means. Li-ion technology is still being improved by about 5-10% each year. New forms of energy storage will be critical to the success of renewable energy as a replacement for fossil fuels. When the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow, we'll need to access stored energy very quickly to plug the gap. As well as traditional energy storage methods, such as pumped hydro, flywheels, compressed gas and large battery arrays, highly efficient supercapacitors could eventually become a crucial component in a fully sustainable energy network. But these are early days. \"Polymer-based supercapacitors are emerging as a promising technology,\" concludes Gareth Hinds, \"but there is a lot of work still to do to achieve the required energy storage capacity without compromising on power, lifetime and cost.\" ",

Here are the contrasting looks chosen by seven A-listers on Sunday - plus one who managed to find three dresses for the occasion. Britain's Emily Blunt was demureness personified at the ceremony in a powder blue gown with a high collar, puffy sleeves and a regal train. By the time she rocked up at the Vanity Fair party, though, she'd traded it for a figure-hugging gold number with floral and avian detailing. The sequins and tassles of her Givenchy gown ensured Wonder Woman star Gal Gadot sparkled on the red carpet. Her post-show frock also twinkled, though this one came with a daring thigh slash and an ever more plunging neckline. Salma Hayek made a bold statement at the ceremony with a tiered purple gown topped with elaborate crystal chain mail. The eccentricity continued afterwards with a pink Gucci gown customised by Harlem designer Dapper Dan. Best supporting actress winner Allison Janney rocked it in red in a Reem Acra gown with carpet-caressing angel sleeves. The I, Tonya star remained a scarlet woman at the Vanity Fair party... from the waist down at least. Margot Robbie looked ready to walk down the aisle in a Chanel Haute Couture gown she reportedly mended herself when one of its arm straps broke. That got traded at the Vanity Fair event for an intricately detailed ivory number with a sheer overlay, topped off by a sparkly globe-shaped purse. Emma Stone, last year's best actress winner, returned to the Oscars in a silk Louis Vuitton blazer adorned with a bright pink sash. A few hours later, she reappeared in a yellow and grey mini-dress. Zendaya, star of The Greatest Showman, seemed to have a circus tent in mind with this off-the-shoulder chocolate creation. The fishtail gown she wore at the Vanity Fair event was considerably more flattering to the 21-year-old's figure. Finally, here's Grammy-winning singer turned Oscar-nominated actress Mary J Blige showing us how it's done in shimmering white, voluptuous red and glorious gold.

        "content": "If this year's Oscars are remembered for anything, it may be for making the term \"inclusion rider\" common parlance. Mentioned by Frances McDormand at the end of her best actress acceptance speech, it refers to a clause actors can insist be added to their contracts. \"[It] means that you can ask for and/or demand at least 50% diversity, not only in casting but also [in] the crew,\" she explained backstage afterwards. Its mention prompted a dramatic surge of interest in the term on Google. Many people also searched for inclusion \"writer\", having misheard the final sentence of McDormand's rousing address. McDormand said she had only become aware of the term recently. But it's actually been around since 2016. It was coined by media researcher Stacy Smith in a TED talk she gave that year, in which she posited ways to show more women, ethnic minorities and people with disabilities on screen. Dr Smith came up with the concept with Kalpana Kotagal, a civil rights and employment practice attorney in Washington DC, and the producer and actor Fanshen Cox DiGiovanni. The University of Southern California professor argues that an \"equity clause\" in an A-list actor's contract could allow the film's minor on-screen roles \"to match or reflect the demography of where the story is taking place\". Speaking to an audience in San Francisco, Dr Smith said: \"The typical feature film has about 40 to 45 speaking characters in it. I would argue that only 8 to 10 of those characters are actually relevant to the story. \"The remaining 30 or so roles, there's no reason why those minor roles can't match or reflect the demography of where the story is taking place. \"An equity rider by an A-lister in their contract can stipulate that those roles reflect the world in which we actually live.\" Speaking after the awards, Dr Smith said the mention had come as a \"complete surprise\" and that she was \"utterly elated\" that McDormand - who won for her role in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri - had so publicly championed her proposal. \"The goal is that talent can take the inclusion rider and adopt it in ways that make sense for their values and their beliefs,\" she told The Guardian. The good news is that some A-listers are already taking the initiative when it comes to using their position to negotiate a more representative work space. \"I'm committed to the Inclusion Rider,\" tweeted Brie Larson, Oscar-winning star of Room and the forthcoming Captain Marvel. \"Who's with me?\" McDormand also got the backing of former tennis player Billie Jean King, British screenwriter Jack Thorne and Pitch Perfect star Elizabeth Banks.

        "content": "As Russia prepares to elect Vladimir Putin for a fourth term as president on 18 March, the BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse looks back at a revealing event that took place at the start of his Kremlin career - when he was Russia's acting president, running in his first presidential election. Russians rarely see their president cry, though there has been plenty of tragedy during his 18 years in power. It happened once, right at the start of his rule - on 24 February 2000, at the funeral of Anatoly Sobchak. Sobchak was one of the men who, alongside Gorbachev and Yeltsin, helped bring about the end of the Soviet Union. He was also the reformer who plucked a middle-ranking KGB officer by the name of Vladimir Putin from obscurity and gave him his first job in politics. No-one really knows what drove him to make that fateful decision. But today, factions from the old Soviet security establishment have taken hold of the levers of power in Russia to such an extent as to make it a democracy hardly worth the name. There are eight candidates running in this latest election, but Putin is known as the \"main candidate\", and the outcome is not in any doubt. One rival candidate calls it a \"fake election\". \"Just like in a casino,\" she told me, \"where the house always wins, in Russian democracy, the win is always on Putin's side.\" Her name - wait for it - is Ksenia Sobchak, and she is the daughter of Anatoly, Putin's old friend and mentor. Find out more\nKsenia, as she is often known, is 36 years old, a former reality TV presenter-turned-opposition-journalist. Supporters of Alexei Navalny, the quote-unquote \"real\" opposition candidate, who's been barred from standing, say she is a Kremlin stooge - an old family friend drafted in by Putin to lend the election an air of credibility. Certainly, she would not be running without the tacit permission of the authorities. That's how Russian democracy works. But the men in grey suits who run the Kremlin may be regretting their decision. Ksenia is touring TV studios naming corrupt cronies around Putin and calling the annexation of Crimea illegal. If, as she maintains, she is running not to win but to be heard, then she is certainly breaking some taboos. So what on Earth is going on? Let's leave the daughter for a moment and go back to the father. He was mayor of St Petersburg. Putin was his deputy. The two were so close that when Sobchak senior was accused of corruption, Putin helped spirit him out of the country on a specially chartered aeroplane. That was in the 1990s. Remember those days? Russia was in chaos. Its president, Boris Yeltsin, was frequently drunk and barely functioning. The men in grey suits in the Kremlin thought they'd found just the solution - another grey man, a blank slate, from which to build the ideal antidote to Yeltsin. They began grooming Putin as his successor. Then, suddenly, just as Putin was running for president for the first time, his old friend Anatoly Sobchak died, at the age of 62, in a hotel room in Kaliningrad. The autopsy said it was cardiac arrest but can't find any trace of a heart attack. Sobchak's widow suspected foul play and had her own autopsy done. Her name is Lyudmila Narusova. I met her recently and asked her if she thought her husband had been murdered. She paused long enough to say \"Yes\" 10 times over, and then replied: \"I don't know.\" Some have suggested Putin may have had a hand in his death. Did Sobchak have something on him? Narusova dismissed that idea out of hand I went back and looked at the footage of the funeral. Putin really is distraught. His eyes are red, he seems to struggle to swallow as he embraces Lyudmila Narusova. Putin is not an actor. Nor is he prone to public displays of emotion. So it's reasonable to assume that he is struggling with some genuine grief. Or is it something else. Guilt? \"There were people who were manoeuvring Putin into power,\" Narusova told me. She's right. Back then, Putin was a vehicle to power for various factions inside the Kremlin. To some extent he still is. If Sobchak was murdered, was it by one of those factions who feared his mentor's hold over him? Maybe. And if so, did the old KGB officer realise his old friend died in the furtherance of Project Putin. It's only a suspicion, but I'm beginning to think so. I asked Narusova about that autopsy she had done. It turns out she never made the results public, but keeps the documents locked in a safe in a secret location outside Russia. When I asked her why, she didn't want to talk about it. I pressed her. I said, \"It sounds like you've got yourself some kind of insurance policy.\" \"You could see it that way,\" she responded. \"Are you afraid,\" I asked, \"for your own safety or that of your daughter?\" She paused for a moment. \"You know,\" she said, \"to live in this country is scary. Especially for those who hold opposition views. So yes, I am afraid. I am\u2026\" Join the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter ",

        "content": "It's a story that sounds impossible. Lightning never strikes twice, so they say. Except when it does.\"I want our story to remain shocking forever - but I'm worried that already we're not alone,\" Celia Randolph says. On the surface they are a normal family - mum, dad, four kids. They've lived in small towns in America that seemed safe. Celia's children speak carefully and precisely, like their mother. \"I'm not an emotional person,\" Celia explains. \"But I'm now very angry and I'm very sad. America has failed our kids. What happened to my daughter in 2006 shook me and my husband to the core.\" Then on Valentine's Day this year she got a text. Celia saw the words: \"You're not near Parkland are you? There's been a shooting.\" \"I kept saying to myself, 'Not again, not again'.\" Celia dropped everything: \"When it happens, you run. You run.\" Her son Christian is a junior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Parkland, Florida. The first time someone called Celia to say a gunman was in her child's school was 12 years ago. She and her husband Jason were 50 miles from home. \"We raced to get to her.\" Chelsea was 14 years old and they were living in Bailey, a small mountain town in Colorado. The Columbine massacre, in which 13 people were killed, had happened in 1999 just under an hour away but the beautiful forest and mountains gave their home a secluded, quiet feeling. When Chelsea tells her story - which she's never spoken about publicly before - she's anxious: \"What happened to other families is worse. Don't overshadow them.\" She's talking about the family of her friend Emily Keyes - the 16-year-old was killed in the violent end to a hostage crisis in their school in 2006. The gunman had entered the Platte Canyon High School with a handgun and a rucksack he said held explosives. He took six girls hostage in a classroom. The siege ended four hours later when a Swat team blew a hole in the wall. At first Chelsea hid under a table in the classroom opposite, holding her best friend's hand. When a Swat team knocked down the door, they escaped. \"You have to understand, to see a man with a full-on vest, with full-on attire, and a gun bursting into your classroom telling you to get out - you have no idea what is going to happen to you,\" she says. \"As we ran out, in every corner we saw a Swat man with a gun. I saw my friend in one classroom, petrified and pale. He couldn't speak.\" Once Chelsea made it home with her parents, they watched the crisis play out on TV. She watched helicopters, police, guns swarm over her school. \"We didn't know who the hostages were but we could piece together the classroom timetable and who would have been in there.\" Accurate information was hard to come by. Her only option was to watch TV to find out what happened to her captive classmates. \"We saw the girls released one by one - there was a hill by the school and we watched them running for their lives up it.\" After a pause, she continues, \"I remember an image of a stretcher coming out of the school and put in a helicopter.\" The shootings shattered Celia: \"it was very, very difficult. You just think, 'I can't protect my kids.' It's horrible. \"It took away the sense of security that I hoped my children would have. A stranger came into our world and did this terrible thing. You felt like, if it could happen there, where could you keep your family safe? \"We raised our children teaching them to be more afraid of harm from animals than from people.\" You might also be interested in: She consoled herself with the thought that she didn't feel it was a targeted attack on the school. \"The emphasis was on healing and performing random acts of kindness. We all considered it a random act of violence rather than a 'school shooting'.\" But her sadness made her feel guilty. \"I would think I get to hug Chelsea, what's wrong with me for being upset?\" She says looking after a traumatised child took its toll, but that she and her husband gave their children a stable upbringing. \"We have good family relationships and we loved them. I don't think it changed our family life permanently.\" Chelsea finished the school year and in 2007 the family left Colorado, returning to Celia and Jason's roots in Florida. Family life ticked by and although Celia never felt that she had closure, she says they've been \"very blessed\". Twelve years on, gun laws have barely altered in the US. An estimated 57 mass shootings have happened between 2006 and 2018. Still, Celia found it unimaginable that it would happen to another of her children. The second time someone called Celia to say a gunman was in her child's school was two weeks ago. Christian is 16 and is quiet with a calm manner. He's smart and Celia and Jason chose Marjory Stoneman Douglas, in Parkland, Florida, for its academic reputation. He was in a culinary class when he and his classmates heard shots. Their teacher, Ashley Kurth, pushed them into a cupboard. \"At first we didn't take it seriously but then we got quieter and quieter. I resigned myself to the floor. I couldn't convey any emotions because we had to stay silent. People were texting their parents, but I couldn't - I had forgotten to charge my phone.\" After getting the news, Celia ran to her car. She got as close to the school as possible. \"I couldn't get any information. I was texting him and he didn't respond,\" she explains. \"That killed me. I was only thinking, \"Is my child alive? Is he scared? Is he injured?\" A barricade was blocking parents' access to the grounds as police searched for the gunman. Christian's teacher let into her classroom more children who'd been trapped in hallway. They listened to police updates through a walkie-talkie. She reassured the teenagers that, should the gunman find them, they were in a kitchen surrounded by huge knives. Like his sister, Christian remembers the Swat team bursting in: \"They shouted, 'Hands up, lie down.' They couldn't be sure one of us wasn't the shooter.\" On the way out Christian saw blood on the stairs outside his classroom. \"We ran to the street. There were helicopters, police, military equipment everywhere. We were allowed to see our parents. At first I was so happy I was out of there but then I became sadder and sadder.\" While Chelsea had felt isolated by the memories of what she witnessed, Christian has the dubious fortune of having a sibling who also survived a shooting. \"She told me she too wanted to stay inside when it happened, that it took her a while to feel anything, that she felt numb at first. She said she broke down, got better, then four years later broke down again. For all the wrong reasons, it's wonderful to have her. She already knows what's going to happen to me - she's just waiting,\" he says. For Celia, two weeks after the Parkland shooting, the realisation that not one but two of her children have been caught up in and, thankfully, survived school shootings is sinking in. Celia's experience means she knows what's coming for the Parkland community, even before they do. \"The other parents and children injured will be dealing with their trauma for a long, long time. I feel sad I know what's going to happen next.\" \"I'm really struggling to cope with the idea that two of my children had to dodge bullets. It's so sad to me that I have a child that went through it and now has to comfort her little brother.\" She's in a community message group - members recently asked what the millions of crowdfunded dollars will be used for. After all, the funeral and medical expenses of the victims will be met by the local county. \"There are costs they can't imagine right now. The parents who can't work because of hospital visits or caring for traumatised kids still have mortgages to pay. It's for the counselling for the kids, which will take years. But they don't know all of that yet,\" she explains. She's seen one community cope with the aftermath of a shooting already. Although she says Bailey \"came together in an amazing way\" she says \"processing what's happened takes time\". \"Not all the kids in Parkland are going to do well. They're not all going to come out of this OK. You don't have a concept of how long this road is going to be, and not only for the victims' families,\" she warns. It's the first time she's told many people what happened in 2006 - the reaction is one of shock. The family, who found the media circus in both shootings intrusive and traumatising, want to speak publicly to call for an end to school shootings. \"We are not anti-gun, but we are against these weapons of war being so readily available. We need not to fail our kids. People can't believe our family has been through two shootings, but I'm not so sure the chances aren't pretty good of there being more like us unless we do something about this.\" The teenagers from Stoneman Douglas went back to school last week, some of them now famous for their passionate calls to end to gun violence. In the days since the shooting, President Trump shocked lawmakers by calling for the type of gun law changes that Republicans rarely back, and major retailers have reduced access to some weapons or ended links with the National Rifle Association. Celia has seen the cycle of violence, public outrage and a return to status quo many times. \"If Sandy Hook couldn't change things, will this?\" She wants the conversation to move away from debates about mental health and expanding access to guns to teachers, saying: \"Until there's alternative political funding that's not from the NRA, there won't be any change.\" But she believes there is something different this time. \"These kids have access to social media and are very articulate but also privileged. The kids have shamed the adults into action. I love them dearly for it and my family has joined them. Now they need to go to school and just be kids. It is our duty as the adults. It's not too late for us.\" On Wednesday, Christian returned for one day to the classroom where he hid from a gunman. \"I do know that he has not yet been hit with that punch of realisation of what he and his school have been through. This is where my experience of the past makes me sad. That said, it makes Jason and I more understanding of him when that time comes,\" Celia explains. The next day, events began to catch up with Christian and he was unable to go to school. ",

        "content": "School inspectors have warned that there are hundreds of unregistered schools but that they have few powers to investigate or shut them down. When you think of a place that teaches groups of children - all day, every day - the word most people would use is \"school\". But the law in England is surprisingly vague on what a school actually is. More than 350 sites - suspected of being unregistered schools - have been investigated in England by education watchdog Ofsted since a specialist taskforce was set up two years ago. Ofsted inspectors say they don't have proper powers to inspect or close them. The people running these sites say they are not schools at all. Some of them are on industrial estates, in church basements and even in pubs. The BBC has obtained pictures showing squalor, appalling food hygiene and dangerous wiring. Some premises have blocked fire escapes and no access to clean drinking water. Many sites do no criminal records checking of staff. But because of the confusing legal situation, most remain open. The tearful mother\nSuri's son is about to leave his primary and go to big school. Not every parent is happy about the choice of education they end up with, but Suri - not her real name - breaks down in tears when she thinks about where her boy is going. Later this year he will start at a \"yeshiva\" in the Haredi ultra-orthodox Jewish community in Stamford Hill, north London. It is not registered and its premises and teaching go unmonitored by the authorities. Suri's son will never do GCSEs there, as these yeshivas usually don't provide any maths, English or science despite operating full-time. Instead they offer a wholly religious education for boys, focused on scripture, from the age of 13. At their schools, girls are often able to study secular subjects and do exams, but after a Haredi boy's Bar Mitzvah, devotion to religious education is imperative. Those who run yeshivas would argue that they are not schools and therefore don't have to abide by the rules that the state imposes. If you have any information or experience with unregistered schools that you are willing to share with the BBC you can get in touch with us, in confidence, at haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk And the Department for Education seems to accept that yeshivas are not technically schools. In a statement, the DfE told the BBC that yeshivas \"do not meet the definition of a school and cannot therefore be prosecuted for operating as an unregistered school\". The DfE guidelines for England say that any place that teaches five or more children for at least 18 hours a week needs to be registered as a school. In Wales, anywhere offering \"full-time education\" is expected to register. In Northern Ireland the law requires all independent schools to register. The same applies in Scotland. But legal guidance known to have been cited by the DfE says a site is not technically a school if it doesn't teach general classes of education, such as maths, English or science. Hence any place that only teaches religious education - be it Muslim, Jewish, Christian or any other faith - is arguably not a school. But critics say that it is bizarre that a building - where children of school age are taught full-time - is not deemed a school. \"Of course they're schools,\" says Jay Harman, of pressure group Humanists UK, which campaigns on the issue of unregistered schools. \"These are places which provide children their only education from dawn till dusk. The fact that it's scriptural doesn't detract from their status as schools.\" For the critics, to define the yeshivas as anything other than schools would suggest that the children are getting their main form of education elsewhere. The law demands all children have an efficient full-time education, whether at a school or at home. That's simply not happening, says Izzy Posen, 23, who was at a Stamford Hill yeshiva from the age of 13. \"Children are in a yeshiva from as early as 8am until as late as 9pm - if that isn't a school, I'm not sure what is. \"They're not taught anything else at home. There's no secular studies but this is the sole education I got - I didn't get any other. I couldn't speak or write English. \"When I came out of these yeshivas, I had to teach myself English because I was never taught English. \"I remember at 18 reading an elementary school text book. I had no idea what the maths Pi symbol meant.\" Certainly Suri believes that going to yeshiva will mean that her son does not get a full education. \"There is no education at all and we're living in Britain - boys can't speak English,\" Suri says. She acknowledges that many Haredi parents are happy for their children to only have religious education. But Suri believes her sons will struggle to get jobs if they ever want to find work. \"They'll have no future. They'll be stuck on benefits and left behind. Culture is important, identity is important, but there has to be a balance.\" Suri belongs to one of the more conservative groupings within the Haredi community. She says if she were to try to enrol her son in a different school - even another Haredi one in Stamford Hill - she would face shame both in her community and within her own family. \"We'd be considered bad parents. We'd be ostracised.\" Suri took an unusual step and contacted Hackney Council and Ofsted to press them to close the unregistered schools or launch inspections. Despite acknowledging that these places exist, the authorities said they couldn't help her. But as well as the yeshivas for boys aged 13-16, the BBC has found two suspected Haredi primaries that have never been inspected by Ofsted. One was based in a building belonging to a synagogue in Westcliff-on-Sea, in Essex, but run separately by a Haredi group. The children there were much younger than those one would see at a yeshiva. The synagogue denies that an unregistered school is being run on the premises. It says that the education provided is within the 18-hour limit. But when the BBC observed it, it was operating for longer hours. We filmed footage of a teacher appearing to manhandle a distressed child on one occasion, and strike a different boy on another. These incidents showed \"huge safeguarding issues\", according to Anne Longfield, the Children's Commissioner. The synagogue said it had not been aware of any assaults and has requested more information. It has since suspended the school. Another suspected unregistered primary school was located in a house in Hackney, where at least 30 young boys could be observed arriving at the beginning of the school day. When we knocked at the door we were told it was a club and advised to speak to a man - Moses Lewis - who says he advises \"schools and non-schools\" in the area. He points out that there are many more registered schools than unregistered ones. \"I don't think we give the country much trouble by the way we educate our children.\" He says he is confident that the law is not being broken. \"If somebody's got the courage, be it the Department for Education, be it Ofsted, let them pluck up the courage and bring a prosecution and let's fight it out in court.\" In January, Hackney Council released its long-delayed investigation into the 30 or so unregistered educational sites in the borough. It called for greater inspection powers. Eli Spitzer is the headmaster of a registered school in north London, but attended two unregistered schools himself. He took GCSEs after graduating from a yeshiva and believes a solution can be found if the Department for Education acts. \"The overwhelming majority of schools are registered. \"If parents are reassured that what the authorities want is purely and simply compliance with the law, and are willing to accommodate their desire to educate their children in this type of way, I see no reason why we shouldn't be able to find a solution to this.\" While he acknowledges there are some major obstacles - such as the teaching of sex education - he says regulatory inertia is responsible for the presence of so many unregistered schools. \"Like every industry that is unregulated, people just act with impunity, start taking advantage, start cutting corners - compliance and health and safety for example.\" The confrontation\nOn a morning in July 2017, three Ofsted inspectors visited a building in central London they suspected of housing an unregistered school. Just a mile's walk from the Tower of London, the site in Whitechapel was housed in a four-storey block on a stretch of Commercial Road, surrounded by women's clothes wholesalers and curry restaurants. After they arrived, inspectors allege they were called \"Britain First paedophiles\" - a reference to the far-right group - by a former headteacher, Mohammed Umair. Umair is now facing prosecution for racially abusing Ofsted inspectors. He denies abusing them. Umair was issued with a warning notice by the inspectors for allegedly running a school on the site. The year before, Ayasofia Primary, a registered school he had run from a building nearby was shut down after inspections found failings. But Umair maintains he wasn't operating an unregistered school and says the centre was being run by someone else on a part-time basis. Isolated communities\nLast September, Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu addressed the general issue of unregistered schools. He said in \"segregated and isolated communities, unregulated and home schooling are a breeding ground for extremism and future terrorism\". The BBC has obtained a book from an unregistered school for young children in Birmingham that advocates the murder of gay people. \"Those guilty of this crime are to be killed by the sword,\" says a passage in Forbidden, written by Muhammad Saleh al-Munajjid. Another chapter warns a wife against refusing sex with her husband. Elsewhere it says a woman wearing perfume is an adulterer. The book \"undermines the values which British schools seek to promote\" and \"could potentially isolate young impressionable minds of Muslim schoolchildren\", according to Dr Iqtidar Cheema, director of the Institute for Leadership and Community Development, run by the charity Muslim Aid. \"Such moral and conceptual isolation is the first step to radicalisation.\" Dr Farid Panjwani of the Institute of Education says some Muslims perceive they are marginalised and that unregistered schools may be a product of that. A number of factors, including the government's anti-radicalisation Prevent strategy and episodes of Islamophobia, lead to some Muslims feeling \"disproportionate scrutiny\", he says. \"We should not generalise. The vast majority of schools with Muslim religious character are registered and doing well, some of them are performing at the top of the country.\" A school in a church\nIn September 2015 a mixed school called Enterprise Diamond was set up in the basement of St Swithun's Church in Lewisham, south-east London. Nine pupils were enrolled. Some had previously been home schooled. The parents of others did not want them going to a Pupil Referral Unit - a centre that educates children who are expelled or otherwise unable to attend school. The school was set up by Kay Johnston. She had attempted to register it but started lessons before the process was finished. Soon after, Johnston faced serious allegations from her time at another school in 2014. She was accused of assaulting a five year-old pupil with learning difficulties. Johnston was also claimed to have pushed the child off a chair. After reviewing CCTV footage, a panel from the National College for Teaching and Leadership banned Johnston from teaching in January 2016. She denies striking the child and says she was bitten and kicked several times. Johnston appealed and continued to run Enterprise Diamond before it was inspected by Ofsted in March 2016 and served with a warning notice for running an unregistered school. She closed the school shortly after. There is no suggestion any child was harmed at the school. \"I never set out to do anything illegal,\" Johnston says. \"I was threatened with a jail sentence for rescuing vulnerable children who have been given up on by mainstream schools, caring for them, educating them at my own expense.\" One mother, whose son and daughter both attended, says she chose to educate them there because she was unhappy with the alternatives offered by the state. Pupil referral units in the area are \"a pipeline to failure\", she says, leading to a life of crime. Safeguarding alerts\nThe BBC has learned that local authorities across England and Wales have received 52 safeguarding alerts - concerns or suspicions of abuse or neglect - since January 2014 from unregistered schools. The majority of reports concerned allegations of physical abuse, but alerts were also made about sexual abuse and grooming. Alerts were received across England, with one in Wales. None were reported in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Legal confusion\nWhen Ofsted finds a suspected unregistered school, they can only issue a warning notice and seek to prosecute the individual running the school. The Department for Education has to approve this, then evidence is passed to the Crown Prosecution Service, before the education secretary is given the final decision to proceed. \"It takes an inordinately long time and [lots of] resources,\" says Victor Shafiee, Ofsted's deputy director for unregistered schools. \"It's not good enough.\" Ofsted has limited investigative powers - it is not allowed to take away any evidence, enter premises with locked doors or call witnesses to be interviewed. Despite investigating 359 suspected unregistered schools, it has yet to secure a single prosecution against a proprietor for running one. Ofsted Chief Inspector Amanda Spielman says that her \"hands are tied\" and that the DfE \"could and should\" have approved cases to be put forward to the CPS. The DfE says it works very closely with Ofsted and jointly agrees which cases are sent to the Crown Prosecution Service. \"The CPS then determine whether the evidential and public interest tests are met. If the Director of Public Prosecutions takes a decision to charge, the case then comes to the secretary of state for his consent. So far no cases have reached that stage. \"No child should be placed at risk and where a school is operating illegally action must be taken. We fund a joint team with Ofsted to target these organisations and as a result of that, 192 inspections have taken place and 50 warning notices have been issued. \"Thirty-eight unregistered schools have subsequently ceased to operate as schools and investigations are ongoing into the remainder.\" Ofsted says there is anecdotal evidence of some places opening on new sites. Shafiee says a change in the law is needed to shut these places down when inspectors visit them. Ministers have regularly been warned about the issue. Ed Balls was told about the problem of unregistered schools in Hackney by civil servants when he was the education secretary in 2009. The civil servants said yeshivas were \"operating illegally and without the most basic health, safety and child welfare checks\". Then in 2014, details of a dozen unregistered schools in London were sent to the department, then led by Michael Gove. His successor, Nicky Morgan, was also alerted to the issue in a confidential advice note from 2015. \"Her Majesty's Chief Inspector is very concerned that the children and young people attending these unregistered schools are potentially at risk,\" it said. \"It is of utmost importance that urgent action is taken to ensure that they are kept safe and receive a suitable education.\" In October 2015, it looked as if change was afoot. In his party conference speech, Prime Minister David Cameron announced plans to introduce greater regulation of what he called supplementary schools. \"These children should be having their minds opened, their horizons broadened, not having their heads filled with poison and their hearts filled with hate,\" he said. \"If an institution is teaching children intensively, then whatever its religion, we will, like any other school, make it register so it can be inspected.\" But Cameron's promise never materialised. One of the reasons for the failure to act is understood to have been the objections raised by the Church of England. New proposals would have allowed Ofsted powers over any place supervising pupils for more than eight hours a week. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, believed the measures would impose a burden on even the smallest church Sunday schools. But the BBC understands there may be another reason for the DfE's reluctance to act. We have seen legal guidance from 2014 known to have been cited by the DfE. The guidance suggests the DfE would lose in court if there was an attempt to close an unregistered Jewish yeshiva. Daniel Greenberg QC, acting for a yeshiva, argued that somewhere providing only \"specialised religious education\" did not count as a school because it offers no secular teaching whatsoever. The DfE makes a distinction between \"unregistered schools\" and \"out-of-school settings\". In the latter it includes \"full-time settings that only teach a religious curriculum, and therefore do not qualify as schools\". Dame Louise Casey - who led a review of community cohesion in 2016 - says it's a \"crazy policy\" for the DfE to have. \"We do not want kids growing up here who are only taught one religious way of thinking, and that religion covers their whole way of life from what they can work as, who they can be, what kind of jobs they can do, how they treat women. \"Even if it's technically legal, it's wrong.\" If you have any information or experience with unregistered schools that you are willing to share with the BBC you can get in touch with us at haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk Your details and any information you send will be treated in confidence.

Carlos Tavares, chief executive of PSA, which owns Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroen, said clarity over the terms of the UK's departure was \"a big concern\". He told the BBC that uncertainty undermined Ellesmere Port's chances of getting more work after 2021. \"We cannot invest in a world of uncertainty,\" he said. He added: \"No one is going to make huge investments without knowing what will be the final competitiveness of the Brexit outcome.\" Speaking to the BBC at the Geneva Motor Show, Mr Tavares said the decision on whether or not to give Ellesmere more work would need to be taken \"very soon\". A spokesperson for the government's Business Department said: \"The Business Secretary [Greg Clark] has met with Vauxhall's senior management team on a number of occasions to understand their plans for their Ellesmere Port plant. \"The government is continuing to engage with PSA on their future strategic plans for the UK. \" The general secretary of the Unite union, Len McCluskey, said: \"Of course, the government position on Brexit is creating uncertainty for major manufacturing companies but this should not be used by Mr Tavares to raise the fear of closure of Ellesmere Port. \"The UK market is vitally important to Peugeot and if he wants to protect that market share he should openly commit to new models in both Ellesmere Port and Luton. \"Our Vauxhall plants are among the most productive in the PSA family, and the products our members make are among the most popular vehicles in the country.\" Vauxhall chief warns over Brexit Mr Tavares said: \"I would like to praise our UK people in terms of their efficiency, but at the same time we need clarity. \"This is not a problem for the PSA Group, this is a problem for the whole UK automotive industry.\" PSA said last year it was committed to keep making the Astra at Ellesmere Port, but it has also said that manufacturing costs at Ellesmere are higher than other plants it owns. However, it said in January that it was cutting another 250 jobs at Ellesmere Port on top of 400 cuts it announced in October. Vauxhall employs about 4,500 people in the UK, with about 1,800 at Ellesmere Port. The company also has a factory at Luton, which makes vans. In August last year, PSA became Europe's second-biggest carmaker, after Volkswagen, when it completed the purchase of Vauxhall and German brand Opel from General Motors. ",

        "content": "The former chairman of the Co-operative Bank, Paul Flowers, has been banned from the financial services industry by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Mr Flowers was chairman of the bank at the time of its near collapse in 2013 when it revealed a \u00a31.5bn black hole in its accounts. The FCA found he had used his work email for sexually explicit messages, and to discuss illegal drugs. He left amid concerns about expenses and in 2014 admitted drug possession. Using the email provided by the Co-op for such communication was in breach of its workplace guidelines and Mr Flowers continued such usage despite having been warned not to previously. He also used his Co-op mobile phone to call premium rate chat lines. 'Trust and influence'\nThe FCA said he had \"demonstrated a lack of fitness and propriety required to work in financial services\" and consumers would lose faith in the industry if he was allowed to continue in it. Mark Steward, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said: \"The role of chair occupies a unique place of trust and influence. The chair is pivotal in setting expectations of a company's culture, values and behaviours. \"Mr Flowers failed in his duty to lead by example and to meet the high standards of integrity and probity demanded by the role. These high standards are what the financial services industry and the wider community rightly expect of its senior individuals.\" The FCA said its investigation had taken so long partly because of its need to be thorough, but also because, in this case, it had to wait until other investigations into the collapse of the bank itself and the conduct of other executives were well under way. In 2016, the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority banned two former Co-operative Bank executives from holding senior banking positions. It also fined them. Dramatic change\nThe Treasury has now also announced it has launched a new independent review into the way the Co-op Bank was supervised between 2008 and 2013. It said its investigation had had to wait until the FCA's one had ended. Its independent review will look at the \"actions, policies and approach\" of the former City watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, and the current one, the Prudential Regulation Authority. In the period under review, the bank changed dramatically. It merged with the Britannia building society in 2009. That deal was later held responsible for the near collapse of the bank. In 2013, it tried and failed to buy 632 branches from Lloyds. ",

        "content": "A group of fraudsters who conned UK consumers out of \u00a337m by selling passports and driving licences through copycat websites have been sentenced to more than 35 years in jail. The six people, led by Peter Hall and including his wife Claire, operated websites that impersonated official government services. They then sold key documents to people for inflated prices. The illegal profits were used to fund luxury holidays and cars. Mike Andrews, lead co-ordinator of the eCrime team at National Trading Standards, which investigated the fraud, said: \"This was a crime motivated by greed. This group defrauded people so they could enjoy a luxury lifestyle. \"They showed no regard for the unnecessary costs they imposed on their victims - I would say they treated them with contempt.\" National Trading Standards said that the defendants set up copycat websites between January 2011 and November 2014 that mimicked government services such as applying for or renewing passports, visas, birth or death certificates, driving licences and tests, car tax discs and the London Congestion Charge. The group also set up sites that copied the American, Turkish, Cambodian, Vietnamese and Sri Lankan official visa sites where people could apply and pay for electronic visas to visit those countries. National Trading Standards said that in all cases the sites offered little or no additional value to consumers using them, adding that it is believed Indian, Turkish and US citizens have also been defrauded. It said that the \"illegal profits funded a glamorous lifestyle for the defendants\". At one point, Claire Hall was preparing to buy a house for \u00a31.4m when the authorities intervened. Mr and Mrs Hall were arrested on 27 June 2014. The National Trading Standards eCrime team and the police raided properties across Hampshire. Mr Hall, aged 47, was sentenced to a total of 15 years following two trials which took place in July 2017 and March this year. In the first trial, His Honour Judge Sean Morris said: \"Mr Hall was a highly manipulative and controlling individual and it was a determined, sophisticated long running fraud. He was a charming man but did not charm the jury. \"We live in a computer age, and crime is developing to meet that age. People live by their computers and need to know that the services they purchase online are genuine services.\" Mr Andrews said: \"I would urge people to always use the GOV.UK website when looking to apply for any kind of government service such as a passport, driving licence or EHIC card. \"Search engines may seem the easiest route but searching using the GOV.UK website is the safest way of ensuring you do not fall victim to a copycat website.\" Lord Toby Harris, chairman of National Trading Standards, said: \"I would urge members of the public to report any copycat websites they spot to the Citizens Advice consumer service by calling 03454 04 05 06.\" ",

        "content": "Fast food chain McDonald's has started offering fresh beef in burgers sold at its US restaurants. McDonald's is looking to improve food quality and ward off competition from premium burger chains. Burgers containing fresh beef will be sold at most of the chain's 14,000 US restaurants by the end of June. McDonald's UK business said: \"We will watch what happens in the US and see if this innovation is something we should consider in the UK. \"Our patties are made from 100% British and Irish beef with nothing added aside from a little salt and pepper after cooking.\" McDonald's UK said that its beef patties were still cooked from frozen in its restaurants using \"a process perfected over decades\". Need for speed\nThe move to fresh beef is part of bigger changes at McDonald's, as new competitors, including burger chains such as Shake Shack, become a bigger part of the fast-food market, using fresh ingredients to differentiate themselves. As part of its turnaround efforts in recent years, McDonald's has tweaked pricing and added to its menu. It has also ditched ingredients such as high fructose corn syrup in a bid to appeal to health-conscious customers. \"McDonald's is certainly responding to industry pressure, consumer pressure to make the change,\" said David Henkes, a senior principal at Technomic, a restaurant research consulting company. \"It's part and parcel of what they've been trying to do to create a different perception of McDonald's.\" The firm has been testing the appetite for burgers made from fresh beef for about a year. The premium quarter pounder and other offerings are now available at about 3,500 McDonald's restaurants in the US, including in Miami, Orlando and Nashville. These products are sold alongside existing burgers made using frozen meat. Over the next month, fresh beef burgers will become available at restaurants in Los Angeles, Houston and San Francisco. McDonald's US president Chris Kempczinski said that offering fresh beef was the most significant change to the restaurant chain's menu since it started offering all-day breakfast in 2015. To keep service speedy, McDonald's had to make changes to its suppliers and kitchen crews. \"If it slows down the drive-through, that's the critical part of our business. And so we just had to spend a lot of time really making sure that as we were cooking only when someone ordered, we'd figured out a way to do it that wasn't going to slow down service time,\" said Mr Kempczinski.

        "content": "Motorbikes, whiskey and T-shirts are among the US goods that could be hit by EU taxes if the US imposes import tariffs on steel and aluminium. The EU has drawn up a target list of 100 US goods worth \u20ac2.8bn ($3.5bn, \u00a32.5bn), the BBC understands. The list, which also includes cosmetics, agricultural and industrial goods, was circulated to the 28 EU member governments on Monday. EU commissioners are expected to discuss the proposals on Wednesday. The EU list includes: Many of the products the EU has in its sights are specifically chosen to have maximum political effect. Bourbon whiskey is produced in Kentucky, the state of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. Orange juice is a key export for Florida, a swing state in the US elections. Several US companies such as Levi Strauss have already come out strongly against trade barriers. On Monday, it said: \"Unilateral tariff impositions risk retaliation and destabilizing the global economy, in which case American brands, workers and consumers will ultimately suffer.\" What is the EU considering?\nOn Monday, the EU Commissioner for Trade, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, told the BBC: \"We are looking at possibilities to retaliate, meaning we will also put taxes or tariffs on US imports to the European Union.\" She said that if the US went ahead and applied taxes to European steel, the EU would take the issue to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Ms Malmstr\u00f6m stressed that Europe was looking to respond \"to retaliate but not escalate\". But President Trump has already threatened more retaliation. On Saturday he tweeted:: \"If the EU wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on US companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the US.\" What does Trump want to do and why?\nMr Trump has decried the \"$800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our 'very stupid' trade deals and policies\", and vowed to end it. On Thursday, he said steel imports would face a 25% tariff and aluminium 10%. Then came Saturday's threat on EU-made cars. The United States has an $800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our \u201cvery stupid\u201d trade deals and policies. Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years. They laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more! End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump In January, he had already announced tariffs on solar panels and washing machines. What are US's trading partners making of this?\nDowning Street said that during Mrs May's call to President Trump on Sunday she raised \"our deep concern at the President's forthcoming announcement on steel and aluminium tariffs, noting that multilateral action was the only way to resolve the problem of global overcapacity in all parties' interests.\" Zhang Yesui, spokesperson for China's National People's Congress, said it was natural that \"some friction will exist\" between the US and China, given the volume of trade between them surpassed $580bn (\u00a3420bn) last year. But he said China would take \"necessary measures\" if its interests were hurt. Canada said tariffs would cause disruption on both sides of the border. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was \"confident we're going to continue to be able to defend Canadian industry\". Brazil, Mexico and Japan, that have said they will consider retaliatory steps if the president presses ahead with his plan. Has Trump got political support at home for a trade war?\nA number of Republicans have questioned the wisdom of the tariff proposal and have been urging the president to reconsider. US Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has said he is \"extremely worried\" about the impact of a trade war, adding that it could undermine economic gains. Senator Orrin Hatch said American citizens would be made to pay, while Senator Ben Sasse agreed that \"kooky 18th Century protectionism will jack up prices on American families\". Jason Furman, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama, told the BBC the proposed tariffs were \"a very costly and inefficient way to help a small number of people\". \"This could be bad or awful, there's no scenario under which it's good,\" he added. Industry bodies such as the US Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association have expressed deep concern. But steelworkers in Pennsylvania and Indiana will welcome Mr Trump's comments. Is there room for compromise?\nPresident Trump hinted on Monday that if the US achieved a better deal for itself in the latest North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) he would abandon plans for a tariff on Canada's and Mexico's steel imports. We have large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada. NAFTA, which is under renegotiation right now, has been a bad deal for U.S.A. Massive relocation of companies & jobs. Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new & fair NAFTA agreement is signed. Also, Canada must.. End of Twitter post 2 by @realDonaldTrump The rest of the tweet is a reference to Canada and US farmers. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin repeated that idea before a congressional panel on Tuesday, saying that he expects Mexico and Canada to be exempt from the tariffs, assuming NAFTA negotiations are successful. Substantial changes to the Nafta agreement are not likely to happen soon, however. The current round of Nafta talks, about updating the 24-year-old treaty, finished on Monday with little progress. Mr Trump has previously threatened to withdraw the United States from the pact. Is Trump right about the trade imbalance?\nThe US imports steel from more than 100 nations and brings in four times more steel from abroad than it exports. Since 2000, the US steel industry has suffered, with production dropping and the number of employees in steel work falling. The US is the largest export market for EU cars - making up 25% of the \u20ac192bn (\u00a3171bn; $237bn) worth of motor vehicles the bloc exported in 2016 (China was second with 16%). ",

        "content": "National Savings and Investments (NS&I) is to cut the interest rate it pays to investors who buy Guaranteed Growth and Income Bonds. From Tuesday, the three-year Growth Bond will only pay 1.95%, compared with 2.2% under the previous issue. The three-year Income Bond will pay 1.9%, down from 2.15%. The rate on the one-year version of both products will remain unchanged. NS&I said they had proved too popular since their launch in December. At the time they were near the top of the best buy tables, although they have since been overtaken by other savings products. The change will only affect new savers. Those who already hold the three-year Growth Bond and Income Bond will not be affected. The rate cut is in contrast to some banks and building societies, which have slowly been increasing their savings rates, in expectation of further base rate rises. However, NS&I is set a specific fund-raising target by the Treasury, and that target was reduced in the Autumn Budget to \u00a38bn. 'Disappointing' move\n\"Demand for the bonds in the first three months has been high,\" said Jill Waters, retail director of NS&I. \"It is always a difficult decision to reduce rates but these changes will allow us to manage demand in order to achieve our net financing target, while continuing to deliver positive value to taxpayers.\" Anyone who has an existing three year Growth Bond will be able to roll it over for a further three years at the previous rate of 2.2%. Holders of so-called Pensioner Bonds - launched in 2015 - have their savings put into Growth Bonds when the three-year period expires, unless they choose another option. They too will be able to access the previous rate. Anna Bowes, director of the website Savings Champion, said: \"While it's disappointing to see a rate from this very popular provider reduce for new customers, it's not wholly unexpected, as the rate was very competitive. \"The good news is that those with maturing 65+ Guaranteed Growth Bonds will still have access to the old product offering 2.2%, for those who want to roll their funds over for another three years.\" Investment Guaranteed Growth Bonds - a separate product sold online - will continue to be on sale until 10 April. They also pay 2.2%. In the meantime savers can find better returns elsewhere. Currently the Swedish bank Ikano offers 2.26% on a three year bond, while Vanquis Bank offers 2.25%. ",

        "content": "Too many Lego bricks is a problem many parents will sympathise with, but now the toy firm itself has admitted it has made too many. The company said sales and profits had fallen for the first time in 13 years, blaming the weak performance on having to sell off excess stock cheaply. A Lego spokeswoman said it had \"too much\" stock in warehouses and shops. \"There wasn't enough room to get 2017 toys into the stores, and the toy trade is driven by newness,\" she added. The Danish toymaker said dealing with the stock issue, as well as a drop in sales in Europe and North America, had dragged down its performance last year. Lego Group chief executive Niels Christiansen said there was \"no quick fix\" and it would take the firm \"some time\" to grow long-term. The weak performance comes after Lego cut 1,400 jobs worldwide in September, saying its business needed a \"reset\". Revenue for 2017 dropped by 8% to 35bn Danish kroner (\u00a34.2bn; $5.8bn), compared to 37.9bn kroner in 2016. Pre-tax profits slid 18% to 10.4bn kroner in 2017. \"During the year, revenues declined, however consumer sales - or sales in stores - remained flat. This shows that consumers (kids and their parents) are continuing to buy from retailers,\" said Lego's spokeswoman. Lego in numbers\n\"2017 was a challenging year and overall we are not satisfied with the financial results,\" Mr Christiansen said. However, he said the firm's performance had improved towards the end of the year, with sales growing in seven of its 12 largest markets in December. The company has been increasing sales in new markets, particularly in Asia. Lego said that it saw \"strong potential\" in its business in China, where sales enjoyed double digit growth last year. \"However, to reduce retail inventories, we shipped less to our retailers than what the consumers are buying.\" \"We started 2018 in better shape and during the coming year we will stabilise the business by continuing to invest in great products, effective global marketing and improved execution,\" said Mr Christiansen. In September, Lego said its half-year results had suffered because it had stretched itself too thin by diversifying into products that were not toys, such as the Lego movies. Lego chairman Jorgen Knudstorp said at the time that adding complexity to the company had made it harder for the toymaker to grow further. He said that the firm had pressed \"the reset button\" for the group with the aim of building \"a smaller and less complex organisation\". ",

The official administrators, PwC, said that the firm's clients should see between 85% and 90% of their cash returned to them. However, it will be at least a month before any returns go through. Beaufort Securities was put into administration last Friday, after the regulator declared it insolvent. Shortly after the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) took action, regulators in the United States said they were planning to bring criminal charges against the firm. The allegations concern a plan to manipulate the share prices of several small companies. 'No money'\nPwC said it had located \u00a350m in cash in the client accounts at Beaufort, and \u00a3800m invested in client assets such as pensions and Individual Savings Accounts (Isas). This money has now been ring-fenced, so it can be returned to investors. \"We do forecast a substantial return to clients after costs, although this may take some time to implement, and we do not see any returns commencing before mid-April as there are a number of challenges to overcome,\" said Nigel Rackham, the joint administrator. \"These include carrying out an assessment of the accuracy of the firm's books and records, devising new processes to move the holdings of all clients in an orderly and appropriate way, and preparing cost estimates for these activities.\" PwC said it would be constrained by the fact that there was no money in the company's own bank account. It has also closed Beaufort's offices in Bristol and Colwyn bay, and made 90 staff redundant. The office in the City of London remains open for the time being. ",

        "content": "The proposed takeover of UK engineering giant GKN should be blocked, a group of 16 MPs has said in a letter to Business Secretary Greg Clark. The letter, led by Labour MP Jack Dromey and Conservative MP Rachel Maclean, is the latest sign of worry over the deal. Melrose Industries has offered \u00a37.4bn for the 259 year-old firm. The Pensions Regulator has warned that the move could affect the company's ability to fund its pension scheme. GKN is defending itself against the approach from Melrose, a firm that specialises in buying up industrial companies it believes are undervalued and restructuring them before selling them on. That has raised fears that GKN, one of the UK's largest industrial firms, will be broken up and sold to overseas owners. There are also worries over the level of additional debt GKN would take on if the takeover goes ahead. The letter from the cross-party group of MPs says: \"GKN is one of the most prominent engineering firms in the UK, the third biggest in our country. It is a world class success story, the pride of British industry which supplies components to companies such as Jaguar Land Rover. \"We are writing to you because we all have a GKN plant and/or supply chain-affected firm in our constituencies. Due to this, we have shared our concerns about the proposed hostile takeover bid by Melrose and want to express to you why we believe the takeover should not succeed.\" Pension worries\nBosses of both companies are due before a parliamentary committee on Tuesday as the battle over GKN intensifies. Ahead of the hearing, the Work and Pensions Committee published a letter from the Pensions Regulator expressing concern over whether Melrose's takeover would weaken GKN's position in fulfilling its pension obligations. The Pensions Regulator said: \"From the outset we have been concerned that the increased leverage involved in the proposed takeover by Melrose is likely to have a detrimental impact on covenant\". \"Covenant\" refers to the company's ability to fulfil its current and future pension obligations. The MPs' letter also expresses strong concern about the impact of any deal on the pension scheme. It says they are worried that: \"Melrose may well try to undertake a packaged administration when it sells off constituent parts of the company, and send the fund to the Pension Protection Fund, passing the responsibility to others, ensuring it no longer shoulders its responsibilities, and cutting its payroll costs\". Melrose says that it has a history of improving company pension schemes, rather than running them down. \"Melrose has consistently strengthened the pension scheme covenants of the businesses that it has acquired. Every time we have disposed of a business we have left the business free from deficit. \"We have also stated that we will improve the position of GKN pensioners, making a \u00a3150 million cash contribution to the GKN pension schemes.\" Companies involved in takeovers can submit details of their plans to the Pensions Regulator and obtain clearance if the regulator is satisfied that they are putting sufficient mitigating measures in place. However, applying for clearance is voluntary. The Work and Pensions Committee's chair, Frank Field, said he thought pensioners would be surprised to hear that a pension scheme could be transferred to a new owner without the Pensions Regulator having a say. He called for the introduction of mandatory clearance checks for such cases. GKN's defined benefits pension scheme has 32,000 members including 17,000 who have already retired. It has a deficit of \u00a31.1bn, despite an additional contribution of \u00a3250m made into the scheme last October. A brief history of GKN\nFounded in 1759 as an ironworks in South Wales Involved in aerospace, automotive, materials and manufacturing engineering Operates in 30 countries with 59,000 employees Employs 6,000 staff in the UK, mostly in aerospace and automotive technology Ten UK sites, including Bristol, Cowes, Luton, Portsmouth, Birmingham and Telford. Chief executive Anne Stephens took over in January GKN raised the issue of its pension scheme in January, arguing the takeover would put future pension security at risk. Melrose defended itself saying it had \"a long track record of responsibly funding pension schemes\" and said there was no cause for GKN pensioners to be concerned. Melrose also said it had offered to make a voluntary cash contribution of up to \u00a3150m into GKN's pension schemes when it first made a bid for the firm. ",

Hiroya Kawasaki said he would step down, as the firm released a long-awaited report into the wrongdoing. It confirmed that staff had changed or made up data on the quality of some of its products before they were shipped. Kobe Steel had \"deep-seated issues\" around corporate culture and compliance, the report admitted. \"For over 112 years since its founding, the Kobe Steel group has managed its business and has conducted its business by valuing the trust of its customers,\" it said. \"The recent loss of such trust is truly regrettable.\" Kobe Steel: the anatomy of a scandal New leadership\nKobe said the departure of Mr Kawasaki, as well as executive vice president Akira Kaneka, reflected \"the company taking to heart the troubles we have caused our customers, suppliers, shareholders and many other people in connection with the misconduct that took place\". Mr Kawasaki personally apologised in a media conference for the scandal, which first emerged in October last year. He said he would leave his post on 1 April and allow a new leadership to make reforms.

        "content": "One in three of the UK's top 100 restaurant groups are not making a profit, according to new research into the struggling casual dining sector. Italian chain Carluccio's has joined a lengthening list of chains losing the battle against higher costs and increased competition. The deli to dining brand has called in accountants KPMG to advise on possible strategies. Prezzo, Jamie's Italian, Byron and others have already announced closures. A boom in casual dining a few years ago, has given way to dog-eat-dog competition as the now crowded sector faces higher costs and faltering consumer appetites. \"There is little respite on the horizon\" according to Peter Kubik, partner in the London office of UHY Hacker Young which conducted the research. UHY Hacker Young says last year 20 of the top 100 restaurant groups were loss-making. This year it is 35. Which chains are struggling?\nCarluccio's and KPMG are tight-lipped over exactly what options are under discussion. But it's another sign that the old certainty - you can always make dough from selling pizza - no longer holds true. Other Italian-style eateries are already facing the music: Prezzo is closing 94 outlets, Jamie's Italian is shutting 12 branches and Strada 11. With so many Italians on the High Street from Pizza Express and Zizzi to small independents, this part of the market is saturated, says Stefan Chomka, editor of Restaurant magazine. And the same goes for mid-market burger chains. \"Every town pretty much has a decent place to get a burger whereas ten years ago they didn't and so they've experienced some of the fall out from that,\" he says. Byron is in the process of restructuring and is likely to close 20 of its 67 branches. Who is still succeeding?\n\"Wagamama does pretty well,\" says Mr Chomka. \"Likewise Nando's is a fascinating success story.\" Both chains, he says face less direct competition from similar brands. \"[Nando's] goes up against the KFC's of this world but its not a KFC. It's a proper sit down dining experience. It's great for young people. So it's doing really well.\" Another that's bucking the trend he says is Franco Manca. It's Italian, but it is cheaper than Pizza Express et al and also appeals to a younger crowd. \"It has grown phenomenally in the last three or four years as people have moved from larger chains towards some of the smaller chains,\" says Mr Chomka. Why are times so tough?\nThere are a number of things says Peter Kubik at UHY Hacker Young that are preventing the numbers adding up for restaurant chains. The fall in sterling since the referendum vote has pushed up the cost of any imported ingredients whether that's mozzarella or meat, olives or avocado. And staff pay is going up too. \"The government has ratcheted up costs with a series of above-inflation rises in the minimum wage, and we are just weeks away from another 4.4% rise in April,\" says Mr Kubik. \"That will be tough for a lot of restaurants to absorb.\" Mr Kubik says \"Brexit hanging over consumers like a dark cloud\" means people are more reluctant to splash out. Will Wright, KPMG's restructuring partner responsible for Byron's recent deal with its creditors, adds in rising business rates and the burden of debt being born by a lot of the chains - the result of a flurry in merger and acquisition activity that has left some stuck with the wrong sites in the wrong areas. \"As restructuring practice we've never been as busy as we have been in last few months in this sector,\" he says. Are we eating out less?\nThere are certain fashionable city centre places, where if you turn up at the wrong time you can still end up queuing for a table. For example cafes offering highly 'Instagramable' weekend brunches. There is still a buoyant market for places that get the offer right, according to Deloitte. But consumer spending power, squeezed by low wage growth and higher inflation, means consumers are reining in discretionary leisure spending in general, and that includes spending less at restaurants. Some are replacing it with home delivered meals, or ready-meals like Marks and Spencer's successful Dine In for Two for \u00a310. Some restaurants have responded with ever more aggressive discounting; Deloitte found 38% of visits involve a deal or special offer. But of course, in terms of profitability that only makes things worse. How much will change?\nSarah Humphreys, lead partner for casual dining at Deloitte, thinks the current spate of closures is \"a blip\" and that before long we'll be back on the long term trend of a booming market for meals out. \"If you look forward ten years... we will be eating out more often,\" she says. But the current squeeze means in the meantime we're likely to notice changes on the High Street this year, says Mr Wright at KPMG, whether just because the less profitable branches are gone or whether whole chains end up disappearing. \"It's a very fast moving sector. New concepts are what it's all about. Businesses need to stay very relevant and to do that they need to spend money on their sites to keep them fresh,\" he says. Ms Humphreys and the team at Deloitte think reduced margins now will focus minds on improving productivity and investing in new technology like pre-ordering, mobile payments and customisable menus that appeal to younger customers. The future she says will be all about giving customers a better experience, and points to concept restaurants like Bounce which offers meals and ping-pong side-by-side; or food alongside crazy golf, or music. \"It's about making it an experience: something with drama and pizzazz,\" she says.

The plants had to close on Monday due to water shortages caused by burst pipes in the region. Severn Trent said it had worked \"round the clock\" to fix water supply problems caused by the big thaw. \"We'd like to thank the few businesses we've been working with over the past couple of days for all of their help,\" it said. \"It is our normal procedure to work proactively with a handful of large businesses who use a lot of water to manage their usage when we need to prioritise customer supplies. \"It enables us to make sure we have enough water for households and vulnerable customers including hospitals and care homes.\" The water supplier said it had ramped up production at its treatment works and used tankers to support local hospitals. On Monday evening, Jaguar Land Rover said workers at its Solihull plant had been sent home. The company employs 11,000 people at the Solihull site in the West Midlands, which operates a pattern of three shifts a day from Monday morning through to Saturday morning. The plant produces 300,000 vehicles a year. Cadbury owner Mondelez had said on Monday that it had limited water supply to its site in Bournville and some manufacturing was running, but maintained that it had enough stock. It had earlier told workers to leave and work from home where possible. Severn Trent covers a large region from mid-Wales to Rutland, and from the Humber down to the Bristol Channel. The water supplier said it had seen nearly a 4,000% increase in reports of burst pipes due to the big thaw. ",

        "content": "Republicans have raised concern about the US president's plan to impose tariffs on metals, with the party's top lawmaker calling for it to be scrapped. US Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said he was \"extremely worried\" about the impact of a trade war, adding that it could undermine economic gains. But Mr Trump pushed back during a White House meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \"We're not backing down,\" he told reporters on Monday. \"I don't think you're going to have a trade war,\" he said. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Monday that President Trump was \"very confident\" the US would win any trade war. Mr Trump's Monday comments came an hour after Mr Ryan released a statement urging the White House to reconsider its plan. \"We are extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war and are urging the White House to not advance with this plan,\" Mr Ryan's spokeswoman AshLee Strong said. \"The new tax reform law has boosted the economy and we certainly don't want to jeopardise those gains.\" Mr Trump's announcement last week that he would tax imported steel and aluminium has prompted worldwide reaction. The World Trade Organization (WTO) on Monday also called on member states to \"stop the fall of the first dominoes\" of a trade war. \"Once we start down this path it will be very difficult to reverse direction,\" WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo told negotiators in Geneva on Monday. \"An eye for an eye will leave us all blind and the world in a deep recession.\" What does Trump want to do and why?\nEarlier on Monday, Mr Trump hinted that if the US achieved a better deal for itself in the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) he would abandon plans for tariffs on US neighbours. We are on the losing side of almost all trade deals. Our friends and enemies have taken advantage of the U.S. for many years. Our Steel and Aluminum industries are dead. Sorry, it\u2019s time for a change! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump Those tariffs could be removed for Canada and Mexico if they signed a \"new and fair\" agreement, he suggested. The current round of Nafta talks, which focus on updating the 24-year old treaty, are due to finish on Monday and have achieved little. Mr Trump has decried the US trade deficit with other countries, which he has blamed on \"'very stupid' trade deals and policies\". On Thursday, he said steel imports would face a 25% tariff and aluminium 10%. He issued a threat against EU-made cars on Saturday, which he repeated during his Oval Office meeting with the Israeli prime minister on Monday. \"They have trade barriers that are worse than tariffs. They also have tariffs by the way, but they have trade barriers far worse than tariffs.\" \"And if they want to do something we'll just tax their cars that they send in here like water,\" he vowed. The United States has an $800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our \u201cvery stupid\u201d trade deals and policies. Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years. They laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more! End of Twitter post 2 by @realDonaldTrump Has Trump got political support at home for a trade war?\nOver the weekend some Republicans began to question the tariff proposal and have urged the president to reconsider. Many argue that the impact of tax cuts that were passed earlier this year will be wiped out as countries levy new tariffs on US goods and the price of metals climbs. Senator Orrin Hatch said American citizens would be made to pay, adding that Mr Trump's \"action could very well undercut the benefits of the pro-growth tax reform we fought to get on the books\". Senator Ben Sasse agreed that \"kooky 18th Century protectionism will jack up prices on American families\". Responding to the criticism on CNN, White House economic adviser Peter Navarro dismissed the number of Republicans opposed Mr Trump's tariff plan. \"Guess what: He beat them,\" Mr Navarro said, referring to the outcome of the 2016 election. He added that Republicans are \"dead wrong on the economics\". Industry bodies like the US Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association have expressed deep concern. How has the EU responded to the tariff threat?\nLevi jeans and bourbon could be hit with a 25% import tax by the European Union if Mr Trump imposes tariffs on European steel and aluminium. Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, EU Commissioner for Trade, told the BBC the items were on a draft list of US goods to be taxed. Ms Malmstr\u00f6m told the BBC: \"We are looking at possibilities to retaliate, meaning we will also put taxes or tariffs on US imports to the European Union.\" What do US trading partners make of this?\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had \"forcefully defended\" Canadian industry in a phone call to Mr Trump on Monday, his office said. A spokesman described the conversation as \"constructive\" but gave no details. Canada has warned that tariffs would cause disruption on both sides of the border. Downing Street said that during Mrs May's call to President Trump on Sunday she raised \"our deep concern at the president's forthcoming announcement on steel and aluminium tariffs, noting that multilateral action was the only way to resolve the problem of global overcapacity in all parties' interests\". Zhang Yesui, spokesperson for China's National People's Congress, said it was natural that \"some friction will exist\" between the US and China, given the volume of trade between them surpassed $580bn (\u00a3420bn) last year. But he said China would take \"necessary measures\" if its interests were hurt. EU trade chiefs could apply 25% tariffs on about $3.5bn of imports from the US - targeting iconic US exports including Levi's jeans, Harley-Davidson motorbikes and bourbon whiskey. Brazil, Mexico and Japan have said they will consider retaliatory steps if the president presses ahead with his plan next week. The move has also been strongly criticised by the International Monetary Fund and the WTO. Is Trump right about the trade imbalance?\nThe US imports steel from more than 100 nations and brings in four times more steel from abroad than it exports. Since 2000, the US steel industry has suffered, with production dropping and the number of employees in steel work falling. The US is the largest export market for EU cars - making up 25% of the \u20ac192bn (\u00a3171bn; $237bn) worth of motor vehicles the bloc exported in 2016 (China was second with 16%). ",

        "content": "How much is a handbag worth? Say \u00a3100? Maybe \u00a3500? Perhaps even \u00a31,000? How about handing over $380,000 (\u00a3279,000) for one bag - and a second-hand one at that? For that price, you could buy a house in the UK (where the average dwelling costs \u00a3223,285, according to the Halifax) and still have plenty left over. Yet astonishingly last year someone did pay that amount of money for a rare 2014 Himalaya Birkin - a matte white handbag by Hermes. You may also like:\nIt was fashioned from Nilo crocodile hide and adorned with 18-carat white gold and diamond-encrusted details. While \u00a3279,000 is a record breaking price tag for this \"holy grail\" of handbags, it is a drop in the ocean when it comes to the increasingly lucrative market for buying and selling pre-owned luxury \"arm furniture\". High-end bags have come a long way from the days when Princess Grace of Monaco used an Hermes Sac a depeches to hide her growing baby bump from the paparazzi. It was subsequently renamed the Kelly bag after the former Hollywood star. Expensive handbags are now ubiquitous among celebrities such as reality TV personalities Kim Kardashian West and her mother Kris Jenner. However, these bags are no frivolous trinkets. Auction house Christie's says the global pre-owned luxury handbag market has jumped from being worth \u00a35.1m in 2011 to \u00a326m in 2016. Heritage Auctions believes that the worldwide secondary auction market for the \"ultra high-end bags\" is between $75m and $100m \"and growing\". In investment terms, these assets can offer a huge return on your cash. Investment bank Jefferies reckons that some bags can generate returns of about 30% a year. Handbags made by Hermes, the French luxury goods house, are the most sought-after. Rachel Koffsky, a specialist in handbags and accessories at Christie's, says Hermes handbags \"have been crafted in the same way, in the same materials for decades, whereas many other brands have been inconsistent in production over the past 100 years\". She adds that the three best-known bags - the Kelly, the Birkin, made for the singer and actress Jane Birkin, and the Constance, named after the fifth child of Hermes designer Catherine Chaillet - \"have remained virtually unchanged since they were designed\". However, Jefferies says: \"Over the past 10 to 20 years, luxury brands have increasingly been able to raise the prices of their handbags and use more premium materials so in the future the top of the market is likely to become less dominated by Herm\u00e8s.\" Heritage Auctions says that as well as Hermes, Chanel's iconic flap bags \"are always favourites for the paparazzi to catch on the celebrity arms of the world's most famous\". Ms Koffsky adds that, in the 1990s, two designers in particular were responsible for ushering in the \"era of the It-bag\" - Tom Ford at Gucci and Marc Jacobs at Louis Vuitton. These, along with the characters in the TV series Sex and the City, \"brought collectable handbags into the mainstream\". It also means that the somewhat intimidating world of auction houses is opening up to a different kind of clientele. Ms Koffsky says: \"Handbags have a very wide appeal and is a category most consumers are more comfortable with when compared to traditional flat or even decorative art.\" Jefferies says that handbags are the \"most accessible category\" at Christie's because of the lower cost of the lots, adding that 40% of the 712 buyers in that category were new to the auction house. Heritage Auctions says that there is no typical buyer. They can range from people who want to add to their existing handbag collection - or those who would like to start one. Ms Koffsky says quite often buyers become sellers and vice versa. She says: \"At the top end of the buyer spectrum, we have collectors who count their handbags among their most valuable assets. On the other end, we have young and savvy shoppers looking for a vintage piece that will stand out from current trends, oftentimes it is significantly less than retail. \"Perhaps it is their first time buying at auction.\" However, while handbags have attracted a new clientele, it isn't a world open to everyone. A new Kelly or Birkin bag can cost about \u00a37,000 each - if you can get your hands on one - while a new Chanel classic mini flap bag costs $3,300 (\u00a32,392). Choosing a second-hand bag may snag a buyer a bargain but these are not accessories within everyone's grasp. Flavio Cereda, an analyst at Jefferies, says that Hong Kong has become a hot spot for high-end handbags. Forbes recently reported that the combined wealth of Hong Kong's billionaires soared by $60bn to $307bn last year - the biggest rise for a Forbes Asia 50 list. Christie's said 46% of its luxury handbag auction sales were in Asia in 2017, followed by the US at 30% while Europe, the Middle East and Africa accounted for 24%. It is no coincidence that those two rare Himalaya Birkins bags were auctioned in Hong Kong. These are the type of handbags that make good investments, says Ms Koffsky. \"For a positive return on investment, numbered and limited edition pieces will stand out as they are only created in a very limited run,\" she says. \"The less pieces exist on the secondary market, the more that a collector will spend to get a hold of it.\" ",

        "content": "Several southern African states have banned processed meat from South Africa after it said it had identified the source of a food poisoning outbreak. The government blamed the sausage known as polony for the listeria poisoning that has killed 180 people. It advised people not to eat any processed meat. It ordered a recall of the product, prompting shops to clear their shelves. Namibia, Mozambique, Malawi, Botswana and Zambia followed suit, all ordering a recall or suspending imports. The Mozambican ministry of agriculture and food security \"asks that all owners of establishments that commercialise these products start to withdraw from the shelves due to the danger that this constitutes to health\", it said in a statement. 'No direct link'\nIt took South Africa more than a year to trace the outbreak. There have been 948 cases of listeria poisoning in South Africa reported since January 2017, according to Reuters - which the UN calls the largest outbreak ever. It is believed to have originated in a factory in the northern city of Polokwane, which makes Enterprise Food products. The chief executive of Tiger Brands, which owns the Enterprise label, insisted on Monday that \"no direct link\" had been proved between its products and any of the 180 deaths. Even so, Lawrence McDougall said his firm was \"being extra cautious and vigilant\" and abiding by the government's recall order. A plant owned by a second company, RCL Foods, is also under suspicion. It has suspended meat production too. 'It's in my kids' lunch'\nAfter health authorities ordered a recall of polony, supermarkets like Shoprite, Pick n Pay, Spar and Woolworths cleared it from their shelves, along with bacon, sausages and other processed meat products. Customers descended on the outlets to return their purchases and demand a refund. \"I already packed my kids' lunch with this product, so I'm shocked,\" said Tshepo Makhura, a 37-year-old call centre agent. \"I lost trust with Enterprise. I'll be scared even if they say this problem is solved. I would rather go back to peanut butter and jam.\" Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi warned people to \"avoid all processed meat products that are sold as ready to eat\". He told pregnant women to avoid any processed meat \"like the plague\", reported Times Live. A shortage of the solution used for testing for the listeria bacteria meant the results of the tests at the Polokwane factory were delayed by two weeks, an official at the National Institute of Communicable Diseases told Times Live. The listeria bacteria is hard to test for, as it is not homogenously distributed in food. It can also \"hide away\" in cracks or niches in factories. Consumers who have kept polony products in their fridges were advised to disinfect them with diluted bleach. What is listeriosis?\nSource: NHS ",

        "content": "Lego's latest set of annual numbers showed its first drop-off in profits and revenues for 13 years this week. After the Danish toy-maker turned itself around more than a decade ago, last year it failed to click with customers. It said it had produced too many bricks, and had to sell off excess stock at a discount. How can Lego have too many bricks? Isn't it just that it didn't manage to sell the sets it had produced?\nIn a way, yes. Every year it forecasts how much Lego it thinks it will need to manage its production, and last year its forecast wasn't on the money. Though to be fair, for the previous 13 years it has consistently underestimated how much it would need to produce, and hasn't made enough stock, says Frederique Tutt, global toy industry analyst at the NPD Group. Euromonitor toy analyst Matthew Hudak says \"a big issue is that Lego has now is that it's grown so quickly with only one product that it inevitably had slow down and hit a wall.\" Lego says its consumer sales in 2017 were flat, but it \"started 2017 with a higher than optimal levels of inventories\". \"The amount of Lego parents bought in 2017 was consistent with the prior year. However, because we sold fewer sets to retailers as we cleaned up inventories, revenues declined,\" it says. Has Lego lost its imagination? Are the pieces getting too specific?\nIt's a bit harsh to say Lego has lost its imagination, says Ms Tutt. The toy industry like every other is cyclical, and after 13 years it's \"fair enough to say it can have a rest\", she says. As for the pieces being too specific, she says today's children \"like to be taken by the hand\" rather than being given a set of generic blocks, and that themed sets have been \"a driver of success\" for Lego. However, in 2017 there \"was a bit too much of Star Wars, not just in Lego, but everywhere\", she says. After three years of successive marketing the market was slightly saturated, she says. In addition, there's \"not a lot of evidence that a toy company can lean too much on licensing as licensed toys are growing quite a bit globally,\" says Mr Hudak. \"The high proliferation of smartphones allows children to watch their favourite shows all the time, which is growing demand for more licensed products,\" he says. Lego says it hasn't run out of imagination. \"Only one out of five top selling themes in 2017 was licenced. That was Star Wars. The other themes were those created by our own talented designers.\" Is Lego too expensive?\nLego is more expensive than its direct competitors, but Ms Tutt says its quality is higher. It doesn't tend to use promotions that much because it doesn't have to, she says. As for permanently reducing price to stimulate sales - \"I don't think Lego wants to go that way\", she says. Lego pays licensing for sets that are linked to blockbuster brands such as Star Wars. That cost is directly passed on to consumers, making those sets more expensive. Lego says: \"We believe Lego products are unique and deliver great value for money. In addition, our products meet the highest safety and quality standards and last for generations.\" Has Lego failed to keep up with 2017 trends?\n\"Households can have too many Lego products and not want more each year, and equally important is that children have fickle tastes, and simply lose interest in Lego,\" says Mr Hudak. One of the big trends in 2017 in toys was \"collectibles\" - that is, toys that can be built up into a set. Whereas the year before Lego was more fashionable, in 2017 the focus was on toys such as Lol Surprise! Dolls, says Ms Tutt. However, in terms of what it does, Lego remains the market leader, with about two thirds of the global market in \"construction toys\", says Euromonitor. There was also a general slowdown in the toy market in the UK as people's disposable income was squeezed by higher inflation and low wage growth, Ms Tutt adds. Lego says: \"We launched some great products in 2017. In addition to our top-selling themes such as Lego City, Lego Friends and Lego Duplo, we introduced new play experiences inspired by the latest digital trends.\" Who are Lego's main customers?\nBoys aged between 5 and 9. The company has been diversifying towards trying to attract more girls, but boys (or more specifically, their parents, relations, and people with disposable income buying for them) remain the core customers, Ms Tutt says. There are Lego sets aimed at adult collectors, such as a Beatles Yellow Submarine, but these are more niche, says Ms Tutt. Lego's largest markets are the US, Western Europe - specifically UK, Germany, and France - and China, says Mr Hudak. Could Lego start using reclaimed plastic to help recycling efforts?\nIn a word, no, at least not soon. The type of plastic Lego uses is acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) which is tough to recycle. Reclaimed plastic would not be of a high enough quality. Lego is trying to move towards using more sustainable materials - it recently announced that it is moving towards using \"plant-based polyethylene\" from sugar cane. This is still a hard-wearing plastic. As children become more environmentally aware, Lego is likely to continue to get greener, says Ms Tutt. Lego says: \"We have set ourselves an ambitious target to make our bricks from sustainable sources by 2030... We are also working on developing new materials. Use of recycled materials presents many challenges, and to ensure that the product safety and quality is not compromised we are currently working on finding the right solution for using recycled materials in our products.\" ",

        "content": "Imagine being able to charge your electric car in minutes rather than hours, or your smartphone in seconds. That's the enticing prospect being touted by researchers who reckon they've discovered a new material that could boost the performance of a carbon-based supercapacitor - sometimes called an ultracapacitor - a type of energy storage device that can be charged very quickly and offload its power very quickly, too. Dr Donald Highgate, director of research at Superdielectrics Ltd, says a material he originally developed for soft contact lenses is also surprisingly good at holding an electrostatic field. Very simply, supercapacitors don't produce electricity through chemical reactions as conventional batteries do, they create these electrostatic fields. Dr Highgate is working with Bristol and Surrey universities to develop supercapacitors using the new polymer and hopes that they could eventually rival, or even surpass, lithium-ion (li-ion) batteries - so long as they manage to replicate prototype performance on a large scale. So far, supercapacitors have been good at providing quick bursts of power - to start a car engine, for example, or to give trains a boost when accelerating. They're also well-suited to harvesting energy from vehicles when they brake, making them an important component in electric vehicles. And national electricity grids use them to provide quick power top-ups when balancing supply and demand. South Korea's capital Seoul is hoping to have 3,500 supercapacitor-powered buses operating by 2020, and they're also being used in Shanghai, China. European car maker PSA Peugeot Citroen has been using them in its cars since 2010 - supercapacitor maker Maxwell Technologies says more than a million vehicles now incorporate its products. But to date, supercapacitors haven't been very good at holding much power or holding on to that power for very long. This poor energy density, as it's called, the amount of power they can hold per kilogramme, has put them at a significant disadvantage to li-ion batteries. More Technology of Business\n\"The two main advantages of conventional supercapacitors over batteries are their ability to handle much higher charge and discharge rates, and their longer cycle life,\" says Gareth Hinds, Fellow of the UK's National Physical Laboratory. \"The downside is that they tend to be relatively high cost and can only store a few seconds-, or at most, minutes-worth of power.\" This isn't a problem when your supercapacitor is being used to power a tool on a factory assembly line, for example. It can be recharged in seconds once it's placed back in its charging dock. But it is if you're in an electric car or bus that needs recharging every few miles. Taavi Madiberk, chief executive and co-founder of Skeleton Technologies, a supercapacitor maker based in Estonia, Germany and Finland, says his products incorporate layers of graphene - a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice - and other carbon-based materials in its supercapacitors. These layers have a huge surface area - just 1g of graphene can cover 2,000 sq m, says Mr Madiberk. This allows them to hold on to a lot more power. His firm's products are already used in hybrid vehicles, particularly buses and lorries. In one experiment, they installed supercapacitors in a Sainsbury's supermarket diesel-electric delivery van and \"achieved 32% fuel savings\", says Mr Madiberk. But he acknowledges that in the short-term, combining supercapacitors with li-ion batteries is probably the best way to enjoy the best of both worlds, particularly in electric vehicles. Ulrik Grape, chief executive of NaWa technologies, another supercapacitor maker based in the South of France, agrees, saying: \"Supercapacitors don't store as much energy but their response is instantaneous. So a supercapacitor could handle acceleration and energy recovery under braking - taking care of the stressful part of a battery's life - possibly doubling or tripling a battery's life expectancy.\" NaWa's technology involves electrodes made from \"vertically aligned carbon and graphene nanotubes that can store the energy on the surface of these tubes,\" explains Mr Grape. These tubes, which are coated with another carbon-based material, are so tiny you can fit 10 billion of them in a square centimetre. As carbon is a light material, incorporating supercapacitors into li-ion batteries would also reduce the overall weight, and this would improve the range performance of an electric vehicle. A Formula E racing car's battery, currently made by Williams Advanced Engineering, weighs 300kg, but this could be reduced by a third to 200kg, NaWa believes, without any loss of range. \"We think the ability to charge and discharge a battery fast will be one of the most important things in the future,\" says Mr Grape. \"We don't have as much energy as a lithium-ion battery but we can do many more cycles - charges and discharges - up to a million. Carbon is such a robust material.\" By contrast, a normal battery, which relies on chemical reactions to create electricity, eventually wears out once those chemicals lose their potency - after about 3,000 to 5,000 cycles of charging and discharging. Another advantage of supercapacitors, makers say, is that they don't require rare materials, such as cobalt. Of course, supercapacitors don't mean the end of traditional batteries by any means. Li-ion technology is still being improved by about 5-10% each year. New forms of energy storage will be critical to the success of renewable energy as a replacement for fossil fuels. When the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow, we'll need to access stored energy very quickly to plug the gap. As well as traditional energy storage methods, such as pumped hydro, flywheels, compressed gas and large battery arrays, highly efficient supercapacitors could eventually become a crucial component in a fully sustainable energy network. But these are early days. \"Polymer-based supercapacitors are emerging as a promising technology,\" concludes Gareth Hinds, \"but there is a lot of work still to do to achieve the required energy storage capacity without compromising on power, lifetime and cost.\" ",

        "content": "A hundred years ago, teams of women were playing in front of large crowds and making big money. Then the Football Association banned them from its grounds. Here's the story of the fall and rise of women's football, told through 10 objects collected by the National Football Museum. \"Complaints having been made as to football being played by women, the [FA] council feel impelled to express their strong opinion that the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and ought not to be encouraged. Complaints have also been made as to the conditions under which some of these matches have been arranged and played, and the appropriation of receipts to other than charitable objects.\" With these words in 1921, the FA decided to ban the playing of women's football in FA-member grounds, which strangled the game as a successful business as the stricture remained in place for 50 years. In other countries there were outright bans on women playing. Jean Williams, the University of Wolverhampton's professor of sport, takes us through items which show the business history and struggles of the women's game. 1. 1895 Sketch magazine print of Nettie Honeyball 'in her football costume'\n\"In 1863 we get the formation of the Football Association and of the modern game. The first women's football games that we know about are in 1881, and they are professional games played to large audiences and they make money. It seems they are organised by local businessmen. The 1881-82 games are relatively short lived. \"Nettie Honeyball is the secretary and captain of the first British Ladies Football Club, which was founded in 1894. She was a middle class woman, and they had a non-playing president Lady Florence Dixie, who was upper class. \"In historic terms this was the first time women organised football for women. The first game was in Crouch End in 1895 before 10,000 people, which must have generated healthy receipts. Hundreds of games follow in the next few years and the women's game is played all over Britain.\" 2. Wheaties cereal box from the 1990s featuring US player Michelle Akers\n\"In the 1991 women's world championship she was the winner of the golden boot. She was the first real international women's football star and was massive in the US. She paved the way for Mia Hamm and Hope Solo, but interestingly one of the things that constricted her potential success was that she suffered from chronic fatigue disorder. But for that, her international profile could have been much more. \"The narrative of the Wheaties box is that she has had challenges to overcome but is still achieving and can't be held back. This is all referred to on the packaging of the cereal, which the manufacturers call 'The Breakfast of Champions'. \"It is one of the first commercial endorsements of this type in the 1990s, at a time when Fifa finally decided they were going to actively oversee women's football, having taken over its stewardship in 1971 but not doing much to promote it in the intervening years.\" 3. Programmes from 1950s women's football matches\n\"The crux of the FA's ban is that it does not ban women's football outright, but stops it being played on member clubs' grounds. Before the ban women's football is an entertainment spectacle, and if you play it in enclosed stadiums then you can charge people money to come in and watch. \"Once the ban comes in women's football goes to other venues: to rugby league and cricket grounds, as well as other venues. These programmes show games being played at Belle Vue speedway stadium, Manchester, and at a general sports stadium on the Isle of Man. \"But the FA puts pressure on other sports not to host women's games, which destroys the business model of the women's game. And that gives growth to the myth that women's football has never been an entertaining commercial spectacle. The game is still finding its way back from the ban.\" 4. Christie and Barbie football dolls\n\"These dolls were released for sale before the 1999 Women's World Cup by toymaker Mattel. The goalkeeper of that team was Briana Scurry.\" [The first woman goalkeeper and first black woman to be elected to the US National Soccer Hall of Fame.] \"But more generally, it reflects [the fact] that the American consumer market was sensitive and aware of questions of ethnicity and race. The marketing of the dolls was as diverse and inclusive as it could be. \"There was obviously already an established business around the Barbie and Christie brands, but such was the growing marketing power of women's football that a major manufacturer thought it could cash in further around the 1999 World Cup.\" 5. Shirt from Eniola Aluko's debut, England v Netherlands, 2004\n\"The business significance is that major manufacturer Umbro produced the shirt. Historically, sporting brands have not created consumer markets in women's football replica wear in the same way that they have done in other sports, particularly the high-fashion ones of tennis and golf. \"It is only relatively recently that that sporting brands have released football shirts cut for women, or boots specifically made for female feet. However, while these other aspects of women's football shirts have progressed, what is interesting is that often the shirt sponsors within the game are not of such 'high brand value' as the men's game. \"There is a real opportunity out there for brands such as cosmetics firms to sponsor women's football teams, but you get brands like Nivea preferring to partner with the Liverpool men's football team.\" 6. A ticket from the 1991 Women's World Championship with sponsor\n\"This ticket, being sponsored by M&Ms, shows that a major US confectionery brand was using women's football to try and crack the potential new business market of China. The tournament was played for the M&Ms Cup. Meanwhile, China wanted to establish a commercial relationship with the West. \"There were seven sponsors of this first official women's global tournament in 1991, which Fifa interestingly, and tentatively, called a 'world championship' and not a World Cup. Fifa wanted to get into China and China wanted to join the world football family, so to test the waters this low-financial-risk event was drawn up. \"The event was a sporting success and also a successful media product, it was sold to TV companies around the world, and it showed full stadia for the women's game.\" 7. Ball and boots of the type worn by 1920s/30s star Lily Parr\n\"Lily Parr was the star of the Dick, Kerr Ladies football team of Preston. She began playing for the team at 14, and played for them for 20 years. There are various reports of Lily receiving 'broken time payments', that is, financial compensation for amateur players for time they had had to take off from their day jobs. These women players were nurses, munitions workers, and so on. \"These payments, with her earnings from nursing, enabled her to become the first person in her family to own their own home. Obviously this all relates to the ban of 1921 as the FA decides too much of the charitable funds from women's matches are being used for player expenses. They were meant to be amateurs but the financial arrangements could be described as at best opaque. \"The boots and ball are from her era. She was a left winger, then moved back into defence and ended her career in goal.\" 8. Poster for an unofficial Women's World Cup in 1970\n\"There were two unofficial Women's World Cups held in the early 1970s: one in Italy in 1970 and one in Mexico a year later, both backed by local business interests and played in major football stadiums. \"In Mexico the event definitely looked to piggyback the men's World Cup held in the country the previous year. That would explain the commercialisation of the women's event there, which was considerable, with key rings, badges, programmes and other consumables produced, and a lot of coverage in the local press. The final was played in the Azteca Stadium in front of 110,000. \"The Italian event was sponsored by Italian multinational drinks brand Martini & Rossi, and its final was held in the Turin's Stadio Communale in front of 40,000.\" [Denmark defeated the host nations in both finals]. 9. Postcard of Dick, Kerr Ladies FC (1920s)\n\"Dick, Kerr wanted to be known as the best in the world, but also wanted to plug into the success of the local men's team and the civic notion of Proud Preston. They had a regular paying public who supported them financially at weekends but also at pioneering floodlit matches. \"Most of the crowds at their games are local working-class men. When we think we are being progressive by following women's football, it was these men who were coming out to support the team week in, week out. \"This commercially-produced postcard is evidence of 'ambient marketing', typical of how the team's fame spread beyond their home town to a much wider audience. Newsreel films and magazine articles will also have spread their name further afield.\" 10. Art deco statuette of a female footballer\n\"Because women's football has always been topical, representing modernity, assertive female physicality, and - in its early days - played solely to raise large sums of money, its broader representation has always been culturally significant. \"So artefacts, collectables, disposable items, ephemera, have been created around the game over the decades. This statuette is an example of a stylised female football player that someone would have had in their home. It is 1920s in appearance. \"There were a lot of similar models made around women's boxing and athletics; beautified art deco creations.\" Professor Williams has organised Upfront and Onside: The Women's Football Conference, about the history and heritage of women's football to be held at the National Football Museum in Manchester on International Women's Day, 8 March, and the following day.

        "content": "The opening 17 minutes of the 2013 science fiction thriller film Gravity amazed cinemagoers. In one long take, it shows a Nasa Space Shuttle in mid-orbit being destroyed by a hail of space debris, sending astronaut Ryan Stone played by Sandra Bullock hurtling into space. Director Alfonso Cuaron conceived the visceral scene, but it was London-based visual effects company Framestore that did the hard graft of turning it into reality. The firm won an Oscar for its work on the movie, which took almost four years and a team of 400 specialists to complete - from animators and physicists to computer scientists. \"No one had ever really successfully portrayed zero gravity in a film, so we had to reinvent the film-making process,\" says Framestore's boss and founder Sir William Sargent. \"Many of the techniques and technologies used to create the movie simply did not exist when we started.\" Founded in 1986, Framestore has worked on a host of other big movies, including the Harry Potter series, Batman The Dark Knight, Bladerunner 2049 and the Paddington films; its annual revenues now exceed \u00a3129m. But as the strategic brains behind the business, Sir William has had to navigate a rapidly changing industry that has left some visual effects companies struggling to stay afloat. Born in the Republic of Ireland, Sir William actually began his career in rock and roll back in the late 1970s, renting out musical equipment to Irish bands such as the Boomtown Rats, Thin Lizzy and U2 while studying business and law at Dublin's Trinity College. \"My dad was a chartered accountant but I didn't share in the vision,\" the 61-year-old says with a smile. \"He wouldn't support me, so I had find a way to pay the bills.\" Moving to London after graduating from university, Sir William had a dream of writing film scripts but soon realised he was better suited to the business side of things. \"I guess I'm a failed writer,\" he says. \"But I also learnt the writer is the bottom of the food chain, and if you want to progress there's nothing like being the producer as well.\" Together with four friends he set up Framestore in 1986, with the aim of supplying a new technology that allowed producers to \"digitally paint\" on film. One of their first jobs was the music video for Norwegian pop group A-ha's hit debut single Take on Me, which featured the band in a pencil sketch animation mixed with live action. \"It was pretty revolutionary stuff 30 years ago,\" says Sir William. \"We were starting just as digital effects were coming in.\" Videos for David Bowie and Paul McCartney followed, as well as adverts for brands such as Weetabix. The firm has also worked in television, handling the computer-generated imagery for the BBC's award-winning natural history series Walking with Dinosaurs. But it wasn't until 1998 that Hollywood came knocking, and Framestore was hired to work on sci-fi comedy Lost in Space staring Gary Oldman and Matt Leblanc. Sir William says the movie, which was shot in London, heralded a renaissance in British film-making. \"America didn't see the UK as a centre of excellence of film-making in those days - but today it is,\" he says. \"Think about the number of Hollywood movies made in the UK; in any given month you'll have three of the six big [US] studios filming in London.\" Some have criticised the film industry for relying too heavily on digital effects, particularly in blockbuster action movies. But Sir William, who perhaps ironically has always preferred narrative-led movies to effects-laden ones, says \"ultimately it's just a tool\". \"Almost every film uses digital effects in some way - there is a lot of invisible work you just don't know about,\" he says. \"It also opens up a lot of story-telling possibilities that weren't there 30 years ago.\" Today Framestore employs 2,500 staff, around 1,000 at its London headquarters, and the rest across offices in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Montreal, Pune in India and Beijing. Its annual revenues have grown by 12-15% every year since it was founded, says Sir William. Matt Mueller, editor of film magazine Screen International, explains that tax breaks and cheaper technology have allowed firms from around the globe to enter the visual effects market in recent years. This has increased the competition for firms like Framestore, and driven a string of big effects houses in the US out of business. More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: How Simon Carter fashioned a global menswear brand The beauty boss who turned snakes into ladders The macs that make you melancholy How violent revolution gave birth to a global brand Mr Mueller says: \"The UK has been a growing industry, but it could face challenges as more enter the market. \"You might see a lot of migration of this work towards South East Asia.\" Sir William acknowledges there's a \"downward pressure\" in his industry but says it's \"always been tough\" and Framestore has kept on growing. What could be more of a headache for the firm is Brexit, which analysts say could spur a brain drain in a UK industry already facing skills shortages. Sir William admits he's concerned as Framestore's London headquarters employs staff from almost every EU country. But he points out it has diversified well, opening offices in up-and-coming visual effects hubs such as India and Canada, and will continue to do so. In 2016, Framestore sold a 75% stake in its business to the Chinese conglomerate Cultural Investment Holdings (CIH) for \u00a3150m - a clear sign of where it sees the future. \"China's creative industries are growing fast and I want to be a part of that,\" Sir William says. \"China's box office has gone up six-fold in the last nine years. They are consuming a huge amount of other digital content too.\" Despite the CIH deal, Sir William and his management team continue to run the business. In addition to leading Framestore, Sir William, who was knighted in 2008 for his services to business and the UK government, has also held a number of high-ranking civil service roles. Between 2005-2010 he was a permanent secretary in the Cabinet Office, advising on regulatory reform under Labour prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. He was also on the Treasury board until 2010, and is now part of the Mayor of London's business advisory board. On top of this, he still finds time to keep up with his beloved Tottenham Hotspur, and bring up his 18-month-old son (he has two adult children as well). \"I like doing two things at once, it keeps you fresh and you learn a lot,\" he says.

        "content": "Could you cope with eight different jobs a week? Alice did it last year trying to make ends meet. It's not the lifestyle you imagine for a highly educated associate lecturer. Insecure work isn't something you'd normally associate with the world of academia. But that's all Alice, aged 31, has ever known. \"It's just exhausting. You've got no security. And you've always got to be scouting for work for the next term or academic year. \"Financially, it's impossible. In terms of the future, friends have houses, got mortgages, cars. I've no savings, living in debt and there's the impact on my mental health. I've suffered from anxiety and depression from my work situation.\" We haven't used her real name, because Alice fears she might lose what few hours of work she's got. She's currently on a contract with four hours of guaranteed teaching a week in term time at a university in the south of England. She gets paid \u00a340 an hour, which includes her preparation and marking. \"I'm usually doing many more hours on top of that, unpaid, to get all the work done. If you're teaching a new module, it works out less than the minimum wage because of all the extra hours demanded to do the role, from reading time to liaising with students. I would say it's poverty wages.\" Alice has just finished her PhD, teaching along the way. Last year she found herself shuttling between three different higher education institutions, doing five to six hours in each. She also worked in a bar and taught in schools to top up her pay. Alice says that, in her department, there are more people being paid by the hour than there are full-time staff - and they are also doing most of the teaching. 'Secure job'\n\"It's ridiculous given the level of knowledge and experience I have. I think many full-time staff are embarrassed, as we're a bit like a ghost workforce who come in for a few hours, do the teaching and leave. I also work in a cinema at the moment which is a more secure job to me,\" she says. Five other academics, in different parts of the country, including one of the Russell Group universities, tell similar stories of insecure work. One of them, who's now managed to secure a permanent contract, spoke of how he was forced to take occasional naps in his car in between teaching and working part-time cleaning the streets. So how much teaching in our universities is being delivered by academics who are hourly paid or on insecure contracts? Jonathan White, the University and College Union's (UCU) bargaining policy and negotiating official, says: \"We've argued for years that a lot of the teaching in universities is, in fact, done by people precariously employed, struggling to make ends meet and universities have been trying to sweep it under the carpet.\" He sent a freedom of information request to 135 higher education institutions last year, seeking figures on the amount of teaching delivered by hourly paid staff. More than half either wouldn't or couldn't disclose any data; others provided partial information, including Alice's university. Only 38 universities provided useable material on the 2015/16 academic year, with lots of caveats over its accuracy. In other words, it's not possible to draw any clear-cut conclusions. But it did throw up some interesting examples. For instance, the University of Derby reported just over a quarter of its teaching was done by hourly-paid staff. So did University College Birmingham. According to Mr White, there's enough information to show the problem's much bigger than universities want to admit. \"What we're trying to do is an approximation of scale,\" he says. \"What we found is broadly what we thought we'd find. There are tens of thousands of people teaching hundreds of thousands of hours of education who are being paid by the hour.\" University employers say the report is flawed and misleading, along with all the other research the UCU has done. Their association, UCEA, believes casual staff do a very small amount of teaching. \"The quality of very many degree programmes at higher education institutions today is frequently enhanced by input from skilled professionals from outside the sector contributing specialist teaching on specific courses,\" it said in a statement. \"Such input is hugely valued by students and is often essential for the programme's accreditation. Hourly-paid teaching and tutoring also provide important developmental opportunities for postgraduates, particularly for those interested in a future career in the sector.\" The Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa) is responsible for publishing the official data. It says the data, as it's currently gathered, doesn't give a straight answer on the level of precarious employment in academia. \"We do know that around one third of academic staff, around 70,000 people, are on fixed-term contracts. We don't know much detail below that. For instance, how they feel or how many hours they do or anything like that level of data. It's just not obvious,\" says Hesa's chief executive, Paul Clark. Hesa, he says, is hoping to start publishing more detailed analysis on employment in a year or so's time. 'Much more freedom'\nFor universities, short-term contracts have become more important then they used to be. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, an independent think tank, says: \"Universities look and feel just a little bit more like running a business than they used to. \"One thing that's changed, for example, is that students have much more freedom about which university they go to and universities are now free to recruit as many students as they like. \"It's a volatile situation. There are uncertainties about Brexit, how many international students there will be and part-time numbers have more than halved. \"The other thing is they want to expand popular courses and shut down less popular ones. And if you've got staff on more flexible contracts these are easier things to do.\" Another reason, he says, is the focus on academic research which brings more prestige and big research contracts to universities. But it can mean less time for teaching so universities are left with holes in their timetables to fill. \"I worry that we have got an imbalance, that we have too many of the short-term, temporary contracts. If you're an ambitious academic, you want the security of a full-time position, it allows you to settle down,\" Mr Hillman says. \"Not everyone wants a full-time job, of course. But it's absolutely the right time to be talking about these things, having this debate. If we want happy students and successful universities we want happy staff.\" Alice loves teaching and is still pursuing her dream of an academic career, for now. \"I'm stuck in this limbo position. It's ridiculous given the level of knowledge and experience I have. \"I'm applying for full-time jobs now. If I don't have anything by September I will have to evaluate whether I continue. I just don't want to oppress myself anymore. \" ",

        "content": "Chinese researchers have presented a new design concept for a hypersonic aircraft, which they say is a big step towards one day flying from Beijing to New York in just a few hours. Which would no doubt be a speedier and perhaps more convenient option than the current 14 hours. Research into hypersonic flight itself is nothing new, but it usually focuses on military applications where there is more money for research and less pressure to break even. So will flights five times the speed of sound ever make commercial sense, and carry passengers in two hours across the Pacific? Fast, faster, fastest\nWhen it comes to measuring aircraft going really fast the benchmark used is the speed of sound or Mach 1, around 1,235km/h (767mph). Hypersonic is what the Chinese research is focusing on, with a team at the Chinese Academy of Sciences looking at one of the two big challenges; the aerodynamics, and the engine, which is much harder to solve. In terms of design, hypersonic flight requires something that can minimise drag, that is the resistance to motion from the air; the faster the aircraft, the more drag becomes an issue. \"It goes approximately as velocity squared: if you double velocity, you quadruple the drag,\" explains professor Nicholas Hutchins of the University of Melbourne. What's new about the design proposed and tested in China is a second layer of wings attached above the usual wings, in order to reduce drag; it's a little similar to a biplane. At the moment the developers have only tested a scaled down model in a wind tunnel. So the project is still far from, quite literally, taking off. Getting to Mach 5\nEven if a design manages to cut down on drag, there are still other challenges that remain. Heat resistance is one, for instance. But then there's also the not inconsiderable issue of the sonic boom. If a plane breaks the speed of sound, it generates shockwaves. In simple terms that's a really loud bang. So loud it can shatter glass. The engine is the more tricky bit when it comes to getting a future hypersonic aircraft airborne. Once a vehicle has reached Mach 5, it can be propelled by a so-called scramjet engine: an air-breathing jet engine that sucks in air and uses that to burn its fuel. But, and it's a big but, this type of engine only works from Mach 5 onwards, so it requires another jet engine to get the aircraft going this fast in the first place. That could be an extremely powerful, traditional jet engine but eventually some combination of the two would be needed, say experts. \"There's been a major programme going on in China over the last couple of years to basically design that engine,\" explains professor Michael Smart, chair of hypersonic propulsion at the University of Queensland. \"That's what would be the real breakthrough.\" Commercially viable?\nAside from technical advances and possible landmark moments, the question is of course whether there's ever going to be a commercial market for hypersonic flights. Steal a quick glance at Concorde and you might have your doubts. The supersonic Anglo-French jet was hailed as the future of air travel when it first flew in 1969, but few were ever built, and it was eventually axed in 2003 with no sign of a successor. For one thing, the flights were too expensive for most travellers. And remember the sonic boom? Well that meant Concorde was only allowed to fly faster than sound once over the ocean. This restricted routes to trips across the Atlantic, and hence hurt its commercial viability. So although recent years have seen renewed interest in supersonic airliners, it's all still at development stage. Challenges would be even bigger with hypersonic flights. They'd be even more expensive and also cause a sonic boom. The research paper published in the February edition of Physics, Mechanics & Astronomy boldly assumes that in the future, hypersonic flights will be \"more convenient and efficient\" than getting on board a conventional plane. But it is \"at least 15 to 20 years\" before any such plans could be commercially viable, says Ellis Taylor of Flight Global. \"It's hard to see a market for this at the moment,\" he says. \"Historically in fact, air fares have been going down rather than up and it would be hard to get a wider clientele for a hypersonic flight. \"It would be a very, very niche thing - and that of course significantly upsets the economics of a commercial service.\" Military competition\nAccording to Chinese media reports, the scientists behind the research are also involved in Beijing's military projects around hypersonic speed, and it is defence that lies at the heart of hypersonic ambition. Think of aerial surveillance for instance that could be deployed very quickly, and would be hard to intercept. Or perhaps hypersonic missiles that could render existing defence systems useless. The big players on that stage are the US, China and to some extent also Russia. Unsurprisingly, military research is a lot more secretive and it's hard to say who has the edge. \"Historically, the US has always been in the lead, but China is catching up very quickly,\" says Prof Smart. So the plans for a commercial hypersonic jet, even if they are at the early stages, are a bold marker leaving little doubt over China's ambition. ",

        "content": "British designer Anna Bullus is on a mission to recycle chewing gum into useful objects, cleaning up our streets in the process. More than \u00a314bn is spent on chewing gum around the world each year, but a lot of that gum will end up stuck to the ground. Gum is the second most common type of street litter after cigarette materials. In the UK, councils spend around \u00a350m each year cleaning up the mess. But Anna had an idea. What if the sticky stuff could actually be recycled and turned into useful objects? Around 10 years ago, she began a project looking at kerbside litter. She examined random samples, looking at things like crisp packets and cigarette butts. She then tried to figure out which elements could be recycled. \"One of the litters I found was a piece of chewing gum and as a designer I was completely amazed there was nothing actually being done to recycle it,\" she said. Researching the chemistry of chewing gum, she discovered that its main ingredient, the gum base, is commonly a synthetic rubber, a type of polymer similar to plastic. Hear more\n\"It's called polyisobutylene,\" explains Anna, \"the same stuff you find in the inner tube of bicycle wheels.\" It is obtained from petrochemicals, which are refined from fossil fuels like crude oil. She realised that chewing gum, even once it has been finished with, is a versatile and potentially useful material. Collecting gum\nBut how do you persuade people to donate their gum - instead of carelessly tossing it on to the street? As part of her strategy, Anna created bright pink, bubble-shaped bins specially for disposing of gum called Gumdrop, which can be hung at head-height. These bins are themselves made of recycled chewing gum. A message next to the bins explains that any gum collected will be recycled into new objects. But would gum-chewers use them? The University of Winchester was one of the first places to sign up to use the bins. Around 8,000 people live and work on its campus and the authorities wanted to keep it clean of gum litter. It adopted a twin-pronged strategy to tackle the problem. It installed 11 of Anna's special bins and to reinforce the message that gum can be recycled if disposed of responsibly, it gave out hundreds of coffee cups made of recycled gum to first-year students. \"Students would give the cup a sniff to check it didn't smell of mint or bubble gum,\" recalls Liz Harris, the university's environmental officer. \"It's because so much of the chewing gum sold on the high street is a polymer [so it] can be used to make new products. 'When people get it, it's a really nice moment.\" Eighteen months later, the university noticed a drop in gum litter and is expanding the scheme. Heathrow Airport also ran a three-month trial which it said led to a \"noticeable improvement\" and saved it \u00a36,000 in cleaning costs. Great Western Railway has installed the bins in more than 25 of its railway stations and is rolling out the scheme further. In each case, the bins did not suddenly solve the problem of gum litter, but they did seem to begin to change people's behaviour. Moulding gum\nAnother challenge for Anna was to find industrial partners willing to recycle old gum - something completely novel. She eventually persuaded a recycling plant in Worcester to get on board. It takes her bins and filters out unwanted material, like paper or sweet wrappers, before grinding it into pieces and then compounds this with other recycled plastic polymers. The proportion in the mixture varies, but Anna says each object she makes contains a minimum of 20% chewing gum. At a plastic moulding specialist in Leicester called Amber Valley, which normally makes alarm casings, Anna creates her designer objects. Here, the mixture containing the old chewing gum is put into an injection moulding machine. It is heated and then ejected as a paste, which can be moulded into new objects as it cools. \"There's no difference [from] the equivalent polypropylene material that it's based against, the processing temperatures and parameters are all identical,\" says Brett Nixon, a manager at the plant. \"When you are handling the finished product, you do take a while to adjust to the fact that this has been in somebody's mouth previously. 'But once you get over that fear it's easy. By recycling it and giving it another lease of life it's helping the environment, it's an absolutely fantastic idea.\" Industry response\nThe UK Parliament has considered imposing taxes on chewing gum companies if they do not do more to combat gum litter. Anna's project has been given financial support from Wrigley, one of the largest manufacturers. It also provides her with surplus material from its Plymouth factory to add to her supply. Alex Hunter-Dunn, a spokesman for Wrigley, explained why the company backs the project. \"Gumdrop is a really creative and innovative way to get people responsibly disposing of their gum and binning it. We fundamentally believe that behaviour change is the only long-term sustainable solution to tackle the issue and we are very much behind that.\" Other approaches are being tried to beat the scourge of gum litter. Researchers have worked on a synthetic chewing gum that is biodegradable and will wash off the streets more easily, which is also the case with an organic chewing gum, made from Chicle gum native to Central America, which has a small market. But in the current market, dominated by synthetic, non-biodegradable gum, Anna thinks her method is the best option on the table. \"I do believe that through right design, \" she says, \"we can actually change the way people behave.\" Follow Dougal Shaw on Twitter @dougalshawbbc You can learn more about recycling chewing gum in the latest People Fixing the World podcastfrom the BBC World Service ",

        "content": "What happens now that President Donald Trump has said he will move forward with tariffs on steel and aluminium products? Analysts are warning of a trade war, as officials from Europe, Asia and Latin America threaten retaliation. Mr Trump predicted it would be \"easy\" for the US to win. But most economists and trade experts reject that view, saying every country, including the US, stands to lose in the event of a serious trade fight. \"If what we're talking about is who gets hurt the least, that would probably be the United States, but all countries get hurt in a trade war,\" says Edward Alden, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Here's why \"winning\" might not be so easy for the US. 1. Tariffs may not actually boost steel and aluminium jobs much\nMr Trump promoted his decision as a win for the steel and aluminium industries and said he expects investment and hiring to follow. But technological changes have made the industry less labour intensive. Historians say previous efforts to protect steel jobs have been largely ineffective. The companies present at Mr Trump's announcement did not respond to BBC inquiries about potential expansions. A 2002 analysis by the Peterson Institute for International Economics of proposed tariffs predicted the measures would \"save\" just 3,500 jobs. 2. Tariffs are likely to raise costs in the US\nToday, the steel industry estimates that it employs about 140,000 people - far fewer than in the sectors that rely on it. Criticism of the tariffs from those firms was immediate. For example, the National Retail Federation blasted it as a \"tax on American families\". US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said companies were over-reacting, but Mr Alden says the economic costs will be serious. The Charlotte Observer reports that Electrolux, manufacturer of washing machines and cookers, has already put on hold an expansion planned for Tennessee. 3. Tariffs could hurt allies and prompt retaliation\nIndividual industries and countries - especially places that are already negotiating wider trade deals such as Canada - will be lobbying furiously in the coming days for exemptions from the final tariffs. Absent that, analysts say they expect retaliation - and a broader weakening of the global free trade system. Countries could complain to the World Trade Organisation, but such cases take years and Mr Trump has been dismissive of that body. Moreover, WTO judges may be hesitant to second-guess the rarely used \"national security\" rationale the US has used to justify the tariffs, says Columbia Law professor Petros Mavroidis. Those factors make unilateral retaliatory tariffs more likely, he says. Such actions, which are expected to target industries in politically sensitive US states, could be in place within a year, he says. 4. China has options\nThe US blames China for flooding the market with cheap steel and aluminium and has already stepped up protective measures against Chinese steel products. Mr Trump says wider tariffs are necessary to stop Chinese steel appearing in the US via other countries. But US businesses, including those in the car, tech and agriculture industries, are eager to get into the Chinese market, giving leaders there some leverage. 5. The domestic political consequences are unclear\nMr Trump isn't unique among US presidents in using trade policy to protect politically strategic industries. But how beneficial such actions are is difficult to decipher, given the time lag between the decisions and elections, says Kenneth Lowande, a research fellow at Princeton University's Center for the Study of Democratic Politics. At the moment, Democrats are the most vocal defenders of the president. The move reportedly divided White House advisers, while congressional Republicans, who generally support free trade, have been sharply critical. ",

        "content": "There are a growing number of gadgets and apps on the market which aim to help keep women safe from sexual harassment and attack. But are they effective or could they merely reinforce the image of women as victims? It was five o'clock in the morning. Alexandra Ceranek was cycling through \"a lonely industrial area\" on her way to work as usual. \"I'm a saleswoman and I have to start my work very early in the morning,\" says the 48-year-old from Oberhausen, Germany. \"Two men were standing there,\" she recalls. As she cycled past, one of them attacked her, grabbing her backpack and pulling her down off the bike and onto the ground. As she lay there in terror expecting a sexual assault, she kept saying to herself: \"Pull the cord, Alex! You have to pull the cord!\" She was wearing a pair of undershorts that incorporated an alarm activated by pulling on cut resistant cords made from the same material as bullet proof vests. \"My heart was beating wildly, but I managed to pull the cord and set off the alarm,\" she says. \"It made such a loud noise the two men ran away.\" These Safe Shorts incorporate a lock and alarm that also activates when someone tries to remove the garment by force. Safe Shorts founder Sandra Seilz says her own experience prompted her to develop the product. Returning from a run she was accosted by three men, she says, one of whom tried to pull off her leggings while the other held her down. \"You can imagine what the intention of the third man was,\" says Ms Seilz. \"But I was lucky. A man set his dog on them and the three men ran away.\" Assaults such as these are all too common for many women around the world, prompting many companies to come up with personal gadgets aimed at warding off attacks and alerting others. \"Vendors usually come from a crowdfunding background typically with very similar product functionality,\" says Rishi Kaul, a research analyst for consultancy Ovum. \"You click a button on the device and your GPS location is sent to preselected contacts, sometimes with an accompanying siren.\" For example, Safer, developed by Indian start-up Leaf Wearables, sells a pendant that doubles as a panic button. It is controlled by an accompanying smartphone app. Tanya Gaffney, 24, found it useful when walking to meet a friend in New Delhi, India, one evening. \"I felt someone walking behind me and it just felt suspicious. Every lane I turned into he took the same turn which made me panic,\" recalls Ms Gaffney. \"I was hoping to find a female figure or cop.\" But nobody was around. She sent an alert to her chosen group of \"guardians\" - her parents and two close friends - by pressing the back of her smart pendant twice. \"Luckily, the first person to call me was my friend who I was on my way to meet at the market. He told me he was tracking me via GPS and that he was on his way to get me,\" she says. The man following her eventually took a different turn, but \"the feeling of panic still terrorises me to this day,\" she says. Similarly, Nimb is a smart ring incorporating a panic button that sends an alert and your location to chosen recipients. The alert can also be forwarded to the emergency services. Nimb co-founder Kathy Roma was also a victim of crime 17 years ago. A man tried to strike up a conversation with her and stabbed her in the stomach when she didn't reply. Seriously wounded, she looked for help in a nearby building. She believes having a personal alert device would have brought help sooner. Other devices include Revolar, which enables users to \"check in\" and let loved ones or friends know you've arrived home safely with a single click. Three clicks sends a \"help\" alert. And at the more sophisticated end of the market, Occly has developed Blinc, a wearable security device that includes a \"bodycam\" to record video evidence of an attack, as well as setting off a siren, flashing lights and a call for help. According to the World Health Organisation, about one in three women have experienced some form of assault, whether physical, sexual or both. And nearly two-fifths of murders of women are perpetrated by their partners. These safety gadgets have obviously helped some women avert disaster, but not everyone is convinced of their merits. \"We welcome anything that can be used to improve safety and help prevent sexual violence,\" says Fay Maxted OBE, chief executive of The Survivors Trust, an umbrella agency for 130 rape and sexual abuse support services across the UK. \"But such technology can also be misused - it can be hacked or used by perpetrators to track or stalk someone,\" she warns. More Technology of Business\nAnd Ms Maxted also worries that products such as Safe Shorts could \"play on the fears a woman might have about being out on her own, rather than making her feel safe. They reinforce the image that a woman is unable to protect herself. \"Why should women have to wear clothes that are locked?\" she asks. But as far as Alexandra Ceranek is concerned, her Safe Shorts prevented an assault from developing into something much worse. \"I want a protection when there is a critical situation and someone wants to attack me,\" she reflects. Ovum's Rishi Kaul thinks women's safety wearables will remain a niche market, particularly since there are now plenty of smartphone apps offering similar functionality, some that can be triggered by a scream or simply by shaking the phone. \"Women's safety wearables account for just 3.5% of the total wearables market,\" says Mr Kaul. \"This function can simply be replaced by a safety app on the phone, which is why there hasn't been much success in this niche.\" But for Ms Maxted, the issue of women's safety is more about education than technology. \"What technology solutions are there to teach potential abusers about consent and respect for women?\" she asks.

        "content": "Britain's High Streets are in crisis. This week toy store chain Toys r Us collapsed into administration, along with the electronics retailer Maplin. The restaurant chains Jamie's Italian and Prezzo have announced closures, while fashion chain New Look and department store group House of Fraser are seeking to shore up their finances. Experts say retailers are battling a \"perfect storm\" of pressures and they expect more closures in 2018. 1. Squeezed incomes\nA big factor has been a fall in discretionary spending, spurred by rising shop prices and weak wage growth. A near 15% fall in the pound since the Brexit vote has pushed inflation over 3% - way above the Bank of England's 2% target. This has made imported goods more expensive, with those costs passed on to consumers. Couple that with the fact that wages have been rising at a slower pace than inflation - and shoppers have less disposable income to spend in stores and restaurants. By volume, retail sales have continued to grow but at a much slower rate - falling from from 4.7% in 2016 to 1.9% last year. \"It has been a real issue for high street retailers and accelerated the decline of some,\" says Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \"The sector was already suffering from structural problems, such as the rise in online shopping and high business rates. But the burst in inflation since the EU referendum has squeezed incomes in real terms, leading to much weaker growth in sales than retailers had anticipated.\" 2. The shift to online shopping\nOnline giants such as Amazon have had a huge impact on the high street as more consumers see online shopping as cheaper and easier than going to the shops. And while overall retail sales growth is weak, online sales continue to shoot up. Paul Martin, head of UK retail at KPMG, says: \"With the overall market not growing, it is all about market share, and 20% of that market is held by online players. If you don't have the right online offering, again, you will struggle.\" That is pushing retailers to try to reinvent their stores, with the likes of John Lewis and Debenhams now holding more in-store events and \"experiences\" to lure shoppers in. If shops fail to do either \"value, convenience, or experience\" well, they will struggle, Mr Martin says. 3. Changing tastes\nToys R Us fell short in all three areas, according to Simon Thomas of Moorfields Advisory, the toy chain's administrators. He says it was \"unlikely\" the retailer can be saved because its business model \"isn't what consumers really want now\". \"We've got very large stores which are fairly impersonal. People are looking now to have a better shopping experience, and we were unable to deliver that.\" Mr Thomas adds: \"On top of all that we have the online problem \u2026 people can go into our shop, look at something, then look at an alternative and buy it at a cheaper price.\" 4. Rising overheads\nInflation is not the only cost pressure retailers face. The National Minimum Wage and new National Living Wage for over-25s go up each year, pushing up payroll costs. Trade body the British Retail Consortium estimates that the National Living Wage costs the industry between \u00a31.5bn and \u00a33bn a year. Business rates - which are due to rise again in April - are a burden too, it says. Retailers will pay an additional \u00a32bn over the next three years compared to the last three years, a spokesperson says. \"Business rates are deterring investment in local communities, causing shop closures and job losses in hard-pressed communities and preventing retailers from delivering what their customers want in an efficient and cost-effective way.\" 5. Too many shops\nWith trading conditions tight, retailers cannot afford to have underperforming outlets. And yet many companies over-expanded during the good years, leaving them dangerously exposed. According to reports this week, New Look is set to close as many as 60 of its 600 UK stores as it continues to battle massive debts. Burger chain Byron said last month it would close as many as 20 outlets as part of a rescue plan approved by its lenders and landlords. At the time, boss Simon Cope said the firm wanted to focus on a smaller number of profitable restaurants. Richard Perks, director of retail research at Mintel, says: \"In business you either go forward or backwards - but how do you go forwards? The natural thing is to open stores. People convince themselves they need to and then it goes pear-shaped. \"But there's a lot more to being a successful retailer than your store count - having too many stores wouldn't kill you if you got everything else right.\" 6. Too much debt\nAs a consequence of overexpansion, many retailers are shouldering \"high debt burdens\", says KPMG's Mr Martin. Just before its collapse, Toys R Us UK faced a looming VAT debt payment deadline of \u00a315m. It would have been unable to pay it without a cash injection from an outside investor. Mr Martin says 2018 will continue to be difficult for retailers, but it's not all doom and gloom. \"There will be winners and there will be losers. But if you're not good at online, if you're not really rigid about your cost structure, there will be more challenges to face going forward and no doubt we will see further casualties.\" ",

        "content": "There is an element of poacher turned gamekeeper about former Manchester United football star Gary Neville, who now has a high-profile career as a trenchant football analyst. For the player - who was dubbed 'Red Nev' in his playing days for his perceived role as a dressing room shop steward - also has a burgeoning and wide-reaching business empire that includes restaurants and hotels, property development, and a proposed university, among others. The 43-year-old says he first started thinking about a life after football back in his early 20s, after a bad injury disrupted the career of his Manchester United friend and colleague Ben Thornley, who was released from Old Trafford after just nine league games. \"I realised then I had to be dual skilled,\" says Neville, who in contrast to his former team-mate went on to win eight Premier League titles, and Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup winners' medals. 'Motivated teams'\nAfter first dipping his toe in the business world at the age of 23, when he invested in a friend's design company, he now holds directorships in more than 30 companies that employ more than 500 people in total. \"After my [Manchester United] training with the team in the morning I would go into the office in the afternoon and work with a different team,\" he recalls of that initial foray from the dressing room into the boardroom. Council pitches plan backed by Neville is opposed Neville and Giggs' \u00a3200m Manchester plan opposed again Ex-Manchester United stars' university plan revised The former Old Trafford captain says that he soon discovered similarities between the world of sport and business. \"In both you have to have motivated people, and they have to enjoy what they do,\" he says. \"Also, in football and business you have to work the hardest you can every single day, and make sure you never give in.\" However, he says that in business - unlike in football - it can sometimes be difficult to achieve the \"peer group analysis\" he encountered in the high-pressure Old Trafford dressing room, where players would instantly acknowledge responsibility for mistakes. \"It can be difficult in an office for people to admit they didn't do very well, or have fallen below standards,\" observes Neville, who was in London for an SME business event organised by Intuit QuickBooks. 'Needed stimulation'\nWhile his friend's design firm is still going strong, in his mid-20s Neville moved into the world of property development, being careful to keep this other life a secret from fearsome Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson. \"He would have seen it as a distraction,\" Neville says, recalling sneaking into the showers to make and take business calls away from the Scot's prying eyes. \"Physically I accepted I had to have a rest [after training], but mentally I needed to be stimulated.\" Major Gary Neville business interests:\n'Falling off a cliff'\nThe former England international says from the age of 32, until his retirement at 36, he started to really focus on three areas that might provide a post-playing career - seeking out media training, obtaining coaching badges, and expanding his business interests. \"It can be like falling off a cliff ending your football career, going from playing in front of 75,000 people and then not being able to do that any more,\" he says. \"I thought logically - 'how am I going to fill this large void that is going to come?'.\" He says his parents had a strong work ethic, as did his Old Trafford coaches, which meant he was able to hit the ground running when he moved into his new careers. The former England international says that 90% of his current business interests are making a profit, some are breaking even, and a few - like Salford City Football Club - are losing money. \"That is the reality though for a football club as it tries to make its way through the leagues,\" he says. Focused approach\nThere are a couple of flies in the ointment with regard to two of his other business ventures. There is some local opposition to his plans to develop an area of flooded land in Stretford, Greater Manchester, into new training pitches to be used by Salford City and his proposed university academy. Neville is also promising to upgrade and extend an existing group of community buildings nearby, but there are some objections, including from residents of nearby retirement accommodation. \"They are nervous about noise and light pollution. I am going to sit down and have some cake with them, and discuss things in two weeks' time,\" he says, adding that he believes the project will a major boost for football infrastructure in the area. Meanwhile, his proposed St Michael's property development in central Manchester, near to the city hall, has failed for a second time to win support from heritage body Historic England, despite being scaled down last year from the original plans. The city council's planning department is currently considering the latest application for the site, but the scheme has received a boost after the plans have been backed by council officers. Neville has also pledged to \"stop spreading myself so thinly across so many businesses this year\", and part of his focused approach for 2018 also includes a pledge not to return to football management or coaching. Brexit optimist\nMeanwhile, looking at the wider economy and state of the nation, the opinionated pundit from Sky TV is as forthright as he is about the performance of Premier League teams. With regards to Brexit, which has struck apparent fear into so many business sectors and organisations, he is bullish. \"I am not even planning for it; we have no idea about what is going to happen, if you are not careful you can sit there worrying that the world is going to end,\" he says. \"As employers we have to be agile, and move with changing conditions. You can't just park your bike and say we are not going on. \"It is not the biggest event in the world, we have been through a lot as a country over the past 150 years, and we will still be here in 150 years time when there will still be businesses employing people.\" ",

        "content": "Music streaming - playing songs over the internet \"on demand\" - is widely regarded as having saved the music industry, following an era of music piracy marked by falling CD and vinyl sales. Yet songwriters and musicians have long complained that they're not getting their fair share of the spoils, but now a number of tech start-ups are trying to help them receive what they're owed and give them more control. Dan Haggis, drummer with Liverpool band The Wombats, is a happy man. The band's fourth album, Beautiful People Will Ruin Your Life, recently entered the UK chart at number three - a career best. And this time around, they stand to make more money from their success. This is because they've signed to Kobalt, a technology-driven music services company that gives songwriters and bands complete ownership of their work and a greater share of income than has traditionally been the case in the industry. \"We never used to make any money because we were always paying off our advances,\" recalls Haggis, whose band formed in 2003. \"We'd get about a 20% share of revenues and the label would keep the rest. \"Now we get to keep about 90% of what we earn ...it's such a difference, it just made sense.\" Other tech start-ups such as Mycelia and Choon are also trying to use new technology, such as blockchain, to give more financial power back to music creators and help them track down what they're owed. Mycelia, a \"think and do tank\" of music professionals set up by London-based artist Imogen Heap, argues that having a verified global registry of artists and their works would help make the payment process more transparent. And Choon, a new streaming service and payments platform, is based on the Ethereum blockchain and promises to get more cash to artists by paying 80% of the revenues generated by their streams to them directly. It was the byzantine nature of the music industry's payments system that inspired Kobalt's Swedish founder, Willard Ahdritz, to set up his music publishing and technology platform, with the aim of collecting and tracking artists' song royalties much more quickly and accurately. Clients can see on an app how much revenue their works are generating globally in real time. \"Transparency is probably the key word,\" says Haggis. One of the problems to date has been the lack of metadata accompanying song information, argues music writer Stuart Dredge. If a recording lacks the necessary credits for the writers, performers and producers, they may not get their cut. \"Streaming isn't the villain,\" he says, \"but it's shining a light on some of the music industry's historic problems around data and attribution and making sure the right people get paid.\" But music analyst Mark Mulligan is highly sceptical of blockchain's potential to become a force in the music business. \"No label or rights association is going to allow blockchain to gain any momentum because they rely on a lack of transparency - there's a huge amount of revenue that's never attributed properly because of messy data and that just goes straight to the bottom line of record labels and publishers,\" he says. While so-called collection agencies will try to track down royalty payments for artists and protect their copyright, they acknowledge that this isn't always easy given the complex nature of a global industry that now has so many distribution platforms. PRS for Music, one of the UK's biggest music licensing societies, is involved in a multinational project with Berlin-based ICE Operations, which is attempting to automate copyright processing using cloud computing and machine learning. \"There's an awful lot more to creating a successful song than most people realise,\" explains PRS chief executive Robert Ashcroft, \"it doesn't just happen. From the idea to the crafting, from the engineering to the sound production and promotion - it's the result of a lot of professional effort.\" Better technology enabling royalty tracking and payments means that artists and writers are starting to get paid for the first time in markets such as China, where piracy has previously dominated. Streaming is now raking in more than $5bn (\u00a33.6bn) globally for the three major music groups - Universal, Sony Music and Warner, considerably more than the $3bn from sales of CDs and vinyl records. Services such as as Spotify, Deezer, Tidal, Apple Music, YouTube and Amazon Music have become the de facto way many of us now source our favourite tunes. More Technology of Business\nSpotify dominates, accounting for around two-thirds of all song streams. But it pays many music labels less than a cent per stream. How much of that the songwriter or band gets depends on the deal it has with the label, but the ratio of label income to artist income is roughly 4:1. But last month, the US Copyright Royalty Board ruled that streaming services - Google, Amazon, Apple, Spotify and Pandora - would have to increase the share of their income they pay songwriters and publishers from 10.5% to 15.1%. Good news for songwriters. Meanwhile Kobalt continues to grow in popularity. The firm now manages about one million songs and accounts for roughly 40% of the songs on the UK and US top 100 charts. Its roster of artists includes Max Martin, who co-wrote hits such as Shake It Off for Taylor Swift and Roar for Katy Perry, as well as household names such as Lorde, Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters, Sir Paul McCartney, Pet Shop Boys and Enrique Iglesias. And it is now moving into music recording as well. The Wombats' Dan Haggis hopes that better technology will help secure the band's future. \"With any luck we will start having some money from each of the streaming services each month to keep the band going so that we don't have to rely on playing live and selling merchandise,\" he says. \"It's kind of an exciting time really, putting that power back in bands' hands, giving you control of your career and where you're going with it.\" ",

        "content": "When the Oscar winners are announced this weekend, it won't only be Hollywood superstars who will be waiting anxiously. There will also be eight graduates from a film college in Kenya nervously awaiting the results. These graduates of the Africa Digital Media Institute (ADMI) in Nairobi were part of the team making a movie nominated in the category of best short live action film. The film, called Watu Wote (or All of Us), tells the story of a terror attack on a bus in Kenya by militant group Al-Shabaab in 2015, in which Muslim passengers protected Christians. Nairobi slum\n\"I was at work when I got a call telling me we had been nominated,\" says 22-year-old ADMI graduate Claire Njoki, who helped to design and build the film's set. \"My mum was the first person I told and we cried together. I felt so good that we were able to tell that story about Kenya, it is every filmmaker's dream to reach the Oscars.\" The short history of ADMI could itself be a script for a feelgood film. The film school's founder, Wilfred Kiumi, grew up in a slum in Nairobi and developed a love of film after his uncle took him to a government-funded cinema. He worked in a barbershop to make enough money to go to college. But his ambition was to set up a film school which would give Kenyan students the full range of skills needed to succeed in the industry. \"At first people thought I was joking when I said I was trying to set up a school, but the more I talked to people about it the more they encouraged me and connected me to others who could help,\" he says. Six years ago this month, the college welcomed its first intake of only five students. Today, it has 350 students at a purpose-built campus in Narobi's Central Business District, complete with well-stocked graphic design and animation labs, sound studios and post-production labs. They study a two-year diploma which includes training in film and TV production, graphic design, journalism, sound engineering and animation, and an internship. Self-reliant\nThis is a broader curriculum than other film colleges and it is because Wilfred wanted to teach students to \"produce, shoot and deliver all by themselves without having to rely on others\". The ADMI's leaders say the nomination for Watu Wote, which involves ADMI graduates and is directed by Katja Benrath of Germany's Hamburg Media School, is a good start. But they have even bigger aims - they want to reclaim Kenyan and African stories so that they are told in film by African directors. \"Almost 90% of the content we consume is from the rest of the world - from Mexican soaps to Malaysian stories to big box office American movies,\" says Laila Macharia, director of the institute. \"So we aren't even used to seeing our own stories on screen. This is where we can have a great impact on the world, and also on how the world sees Africa. \"The more films we produce, the more people will see the different sides of life in Kenya.\" In the future, Claire Njoki wants to stay in Kenya to help grow the film industry and change the perception people have of her country. \"I want to tell more stories from Kenya - good stories, sad stories of humanity and togetherness and love,\" she said. \"I believe that people in Hollywood are not the only ones who can make good films, we are showing we can make good films so my biggest aim is to stay in Kenya, grow the industry and tell our stories.\" Putting Kenya on screen\nIt's not just about changing perceptions. Wilfred says that developing the film and TV industry could make a huge economic contribution. \"Just one project is able to employ more than 100 people and the trend globally is that film crews are getting larger and big studios are increasing their budgets,\" he says. \"If we can get our films to a larger market, we are talking many thousands of possible jobs. We have realised we can create content and now we need to learn how to sell it,\" says Wilfred. The school has a foundation which funds places for students from low-income backgrounds, and many of its students come from the slums of Nairobi. \"We have a lot of kids from the slums and you see the transformation in one year,\" says Wilfred. \"They start getting gigs, dressing better, they change and they start hanging out with people who can develop their career.\" 'Move their parents out of the slums'\nBut he says it can be difficult to convince parents that their children can make a career from film. \"My mum was the same - she didn't understand why I wanted to make films when I could do accounting instead,\" he said. \"Parents always ask me if their child will be successful.\" But he is adamant that the success of ADMI's graduates show that working in film can \"transform\" Kenyans' lives. \"It does pay well and, in future, our students will be able to move their parents out of the slums,\" he says. The school is now looking to set up collaborations with other colleges and companies around the world, and to persuade audiences to take a chance on African films. But until Sunday, they can be forgiven for focusing only on the Oscars. If Watu Wote wins, expect more tears from Claire and her mum.

        "content": "Walking into a bar in India, it is hard to miss the bottles of Bira 91 beer. Featuring a cartoon monkey with a punk hairdo and one eye smaller than the other, the labels read: \"Imagined in India\". Despite only launching in 2015, Bira 91 is now immensely popular across a country dominated by ubiquitous Kingfisher. Entrepreneur Ankur Jain started the brand when he moved back to his native New Delhi after 10 years living in New York. Noticing a gap in the Indian market for craft beers - beers more flavourful and carefully brewed than mass-market lager - he decided to start his own brewing business with $600,000 (\u00a3427,000) of funding raised largely from friends and family. The company began operations out of Hauz Khas Village, a neighbourhood often considered to be Delhi's hipster haven, and known for its bars and artsy boutiques. Yet while the Bira 91 head office is in Delhi, the brewing was initially done 4,000 miles (6,400 km) away in Belgium, hence the slogan \"imagined in India\" rather than \"brewed in India\". Mr Jain says he went to Belgium because he couldn't initially find a brewery in India that he thought was good enough. With the Belgians being world renowned for their brewing expertise, Bira 91's two initial beers were quickly a hit in India. So much so that Bira 91 couldn't import the bottles quickly enough, and in 2016 it started making the beers at a facility in the central Indian city of Indore. By the end of last year, annual production had increased 30-fold to 300,000 barrels of five different beers, and the company's annual revenues had reached $30m. At the same time Bira 91 had secured $35m of external investment, including from US venture capital firm Sequoia Capital. Mr Jain now has his eyes set on worldwide sales, and you cannot accuse him of not being ambitious. \"The intent is to become the first global brand of craft beer,\" he says. Bira 91 (the 91 comes from India's international dialling code) already exports its beers to the US, specifically to New York and New Jersey. It first started selling in those two states in 2016, after deciding to push the brand by sponsoring that year's Tribeca Film Festival in New York City. \"Our brand is in the middle of extreme hipsterdom and extreme mainstream,\" says Mr Jain. \"Metaphorically Tribeca [a neighbourhood of New York City] is that too - it's not the Upper East Side, and it's not Brooklyn - so it worked for us.\" Currently Bira 91 exports 2% of its Indian production to the US, but plans to increase that as it expands into Philadelphia and Boston. It also intends to start brewing in New York in the near future. And it hopes to be selling into Singapore, Hong Kong and Bangkok by the end of 2018. Now with 320 employees, Mr Jain says that he recently felt a need to reduce operational inertia in the company, and foster a culture of openness to new ideas. \"My active attempt was to ensure that a lot more people have decision-making empowerment,\" says the founder and chief executive. To do this Mr Jain decided to flatten the organisational structure of the business. His fellow directors saw their senior job titles and assigned seats in offices taken away, and now employees at Bira 91 sit around the same dinner tables, allowing junior and senior employees to freely exchange ideas. Bira 91 also opened a second Indian brewery last year in the central Indian city of Nagpur, and a third is planned for 2018. Brewing expert Sandeep Bhatnagar cautions that if Bira 91 is to substantially increase its exports, it will have to put a big focus on making the best beer it possibly can. \"Companies like Bira, when they want to explore international markets, they have to be very cautious about the quality that they are going to manufacture,\" says Mr Bhatnagar, who is managing director of Ambicon Consultants, a company that helps set up microbreweries and brewpubs. \"They are talking about taking it to various Asian countries, and that market is entirely different to the Indian market. The Indian beer market is still not mature, but those places are. \"So if someone is trying to venture into a place where people have knowledge about beer, that person has to be very careful.\" Advertising alcoholic drinks in India is also a challenge for Bira 91, since it is banned. As a result, companies have to turn to alternative ways to promote their products. Some brands opt for surrogate advertising, and promote alternative non-alcohol products, such as sodas or even music festivals, that have the same brand name. Bira 91 associates itself with food and music, particularly India hip-hop artists, and has a visual presence at events such as the prominent Indian music festival Magnetic Fields. Mr Jain says: \"We want to be part of the whole hip-hop revolution in India.\" Aanchal Chauhan, Bira 91's digital marketing head, adds: \"People will start relating hip-hop with Bira. \"We want to make it a cross-cultural movement, with artist collaborations in India and abroad.\" The company also uses social media extensively, across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. As Bira 91 pushes forward with its plans for international expansion, it intends to ultimately replicate the India model of collaborating with musical talent. While it will face a big challenge breaking into more established beer markets, already cluttered with a host of craft beers, and with their own laws and regulations, Mr Bhatnagar is confident that Bira 91 will make a success of it. \"If they have done it in India, they can do it anywhere else,\" he says.

        "content": "A US lawmaker investigating alleged Russian election meddling says an ex-Trump aide should testify on wild claims he has made about the president. Mr Nunberg said Mr Trump was aware of a 2016 meeting between his aides and a Russian lawyer, and may have \"done something\" during the campaign. Democrat Adam Schiff responded by saying his congressional panel \"needs to explore\" Mr Nunberg's allegation. Mr Nunberg is the latest figure to become embroiled in the Russia inquiry. \"Certainly if Mr Nunberg has light to shed about what the president knew about the Trump Tower meeting, we would like to find out,\" Mr Schiff said, referring to his House Intelligence Committee's investigation on Monday night. US President Donald Trump has denied any knowledge of that meeting, which has become a central focus of a separate inquiry by special counsel Robert Mueller into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin. Congressman Mike Conway, who serves as leading chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, dismissed the idea of calling Mr Nunberg to testify, saying of the Trump Tower meeting: \"I think we've pretty much explored that to death.\" Mr Nunberg, who lost his job in 2015, complained in a series of remarkable interviews on Monday about being asked to share his email conversations with a long list of ex-campaign aides in response to a subpoena from Mr Mueller's team. The political operative, who helped launch Donald Trump's presidential campaign, said in a round of media interviews at first he would not comply with Mr Mueller's demand to testify before a grand jury. But he later told the Associated Press he would probably end up complying. \"I think it would be really, really funny if they wanted to arrest me because I don't want to spend 80 hours going over emails,\" he told MSNBC. While he thought investigators believed they had something on Mr Trump, he argued that the subpoena was unfair and added he would like Robert Mueller's team to narrow its scope of inquiry. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders would not be drawn on Mr Nunberg's remarks, saying: \"I'm not going to weigh in on somebody that doesn't work at the White House.\" Who is Nunberg?\nSam Nunberg worked on the Trump campaign in 2015 until he was fired in August that year over racially charged Facebook posts. He was later sued by Mr Trump for $10m (\u00a37.2m) for breach of confidentiality. The lawsuit was \"amicably settled\" out of court, a lawyer for the Trump Organization said at the time. 'He knew' about Trump Tower meeting\nMr Nunberg said Mr Trump was aware at the time of a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower when a group of Russians offered his campaign staff damaging information about Hillary Clinton. \"You know he knew about it,\" Mr Nunberg told CNN. \"He was talking about it a week before. I don't know why he went around trying to hide it.\" The White House has repeatedly denied Mr Trump knew anything about that meeting. 'Arrest me'\nDuring Monday's interviews with US media, Mr Nunberg said he had met Mr Mueller's team for five-and-a-half hours over the weekend. He said he would not appear before a grand jury to testify on Friday. \"I'm not co-operating. Arrest me,\" Mr Nunberg said on live television. \"You want to arrest me? Arrest me.\" 'They suspect something'\nAt times during the interviews, Mr Nunberg appeared to contradict himself. He said: \"Trump may very well have done something during the election with the Russians. If he did that, I don't know.\" But Mr Nunberg also told CNN's Jake Tapper: \"It's the biggest joke to ever think Donald Trump colluded with the Russians.\" ",

        "content": "Airlines, football clubs, five-star hotels and film studios. China's biggest conglomerates have been snapping up businesses around the world, including some in fairly sexy sectors. Despite growing so big and borrowing so much, they were seen as untouchable because of their political connections. That was until the middle of last year when, after seemingly unrestrained growth, Beijing suddenly turned up the heat on some of those giants. And then last week, some real action. Beijing cracked down on one of those firms - taking control of insurance and financial giant Anbang, and prosecuting the firm's head. This, analysts suggest, could indicate more intervention is on the way. Who might be next?\nThe move against Anbang was called a \"warning shot\" by the Economist Intelligence Unit. But it is just one of the businesses which became known as \"grey rhinos\" - large, visible problems in an economy which are often ignored, until they start moving fast and trampling everything in their wake. And next in Beijing's crosshairs, analysts predict, is likely to be HNA, which has been described as the biggest company you've probably never heard of. Investing an estimated $40bn (\u00a328.7bn) in the past three years, it differs from Anbang having primarily bought into \"real businesses\" rather than being built mainly around complex financial structures. It owns China's Hainan Airlines, airport services firm Swissport, airline caterer Gate Gourmet, holds a major stake in Deutsche Bank, has a 25% share in the Hilton hotel group, and owns Carlson Hotels, which runs the Radisson chain. While there's no suggestion it's in financial difficulties, expect Beijing to lean on HNA to get rid of \"most if not all of its financial sector holdings\", says Michael Hirson of analysts Eurasia Group. Earlier this month, HNA said it had reduced its stake in Deutsche Bank from 9.9% to 9.2%. While most of Anbang's investors were individuals putting cash into things such as insurance policies, HNA's backers are mainly institutions. On the one hand, this would mean its collapse would be far less politically sensitive. The common man or woman on the street rarely sheds tears when financial giants get their fingers burned. But Eurasia Group says we should not expect a too punitive approach from the government. \"Beijing is reluctant to impose major losses on bondholders, which would make it more expensive for many other Chinese corporates to obtain external financing,\" Mr Hirson said. Significant bankruptcies would also carry political risks. HNA hasn't commented. But speaking last year to the BBC, chief executive Adam Tan was sanguine about plans by Beijing to tighten restrictions on Chinese businesses spending money abroad. He predicted HNA would still get support from Chinese banks, and could count on international banks as well because of its large presence outside of China. It seems unlikely he will feel so secure today. What about Dalian Wanda?\nOf all the Chinese firms facing a crackdown, Dalian Wanda has the highest profile overseas, partly because of the sort of investments it made. Run by Wang Jianlin, among the country's richest men, it grew into one of the country's most prominent property developers. And it invested overseas too, most noticeably in Hollywood - controlling the AMC cinema chain as well as Legendary Entertainment, co-producer of hit films such as Godzilla and The Dark Knight Rises. But Mr Wang, once considered a Beijing favourite, fell foul of the establishment, with lenders told to pull out their backing. And after the warnings came he was quick to offload businesses, including theme parks and hotels in one of China's biggest property deals as it focused on its core shopping mall and cinema businesses. A subsequent rejigging of the deal just added to the picture of chaos. Earlier it had pulled out of a $1bn bid for Dick Clark Productions - the owner of the Golden Globe TV and film awards - with China's clampdown on overseas investments blamed. Michael Hirson of Eurasia Group described the asset selling as \"aggressive moves\" to \"de-risk\". They were, he added, \"a painful decision for Wang but one that now looks very astute\". Who else is in the spotlight?\nThe other big player put on the watch list in mid-2017 was Fosun. It has investments in the English football club Wolverhampton Wanderers, leisure group Club Med, travel firm Thomas Cook and entertainments business Cirque de Soleil. And unlike the others, is still buying abroad. Just last week, it said it had completed a deal to become the majority shareholder in Lanvin, France's oldest surviving couture label. Though by its standards, the investment of about $120m is fairly small. Both Wanda and Fosun \"appear to be on more solid political ground\", according to Mr Hirson. What does this mean for Chinese overseas investment?\nThe clampdown is very much aimed at the large conglomerates buying into a huge range of sectors. Most other firms are able to keep investing. But there has been a fall from the peak years of 2015 and 2016. The number of Chinese deals in the US and Europe fell by almost 25% in 2017 from the previous year, Dealogic said. And the rhetoric against Chinese investment in the US from the Trump administration - as seen in the collapse of some major deals - means this trend is likely to continue. Just this week, Germany said it would be watching closely after Geely snapped up nearly 10% of Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler. Why was Anbang targeted?\nTo recap from last week, Anbang firm was known for its aggressive international acquisitions, including New York's Waldorf Astoria hotel. But Chinese authorities have been cracking down on the financial industry to guard against excessive borrowing and risk. The firm's head Wu Xiaohui, who was already detained by authorities last June, is to face prosecution for \"economic crimes\". Analysts at Eurasia Group described it as \"both a takedown and a bailout\". \"Beijing's approach reveals President Xi Jinping's approach to cracking down on conglomerates - punish wrong-doing by executives while sending a reassuring message to the markets,\" said Eurasia Group's Michael Hirson. China could have nationalised Anbang instead (as, for example, happened during the UK banking crisis in 2008 with Royal Bank of Scotland). Or it might have forced its sale to another company (continuing the UK analogy, look at how HBOS was sold to Lloyds Banking Group). Instead it put it under the stewardship of China's insurance regulator for one year. This, notes Mr Hirson was a \"relatively transparent and investor-friendly\" approach, allowing the regulators to sell-off Anbang assets and bring in funds while keeping it out of state ownership. ",

        "content": "Media playback is not supported on this device Serena Williams says she frequently wondered how she would keep going after returning to the practice courts following the birth of her first child. The 23-time Grand Slam singles champion will return to the WTA Tour at Indian Wells in California this week. In an interview with BBC Sport, the 36-year-old American said she is motivated by the thought of playing long enough for her six-month-old daughter to have memories of watching her. \"It's been hard,\" she said. \"There have been so many days, even still, when I'm like, 'how am I going to keep going?' \"It's been really, really difficult but I keep going and I know that I might not be at my best yet, but I'm getting there and every day is a new day and every day I should be getting better. \"As long as I'm moving forward, even if it's at a turtle's pace, then I'm OK with that.\" Williams was speaking before competing at the Tiebreak Tens event at New York's Madison Square Garden. In an article for CNN last month, she wrote she feels \"lucky to have survived\" Alexis Olympia's birth, having suffered a pulmonary embolism after an emergency Caesarean section. But now, having played an exhibition match in Abu Dhabi in late December and a doubles rubber for the US Fed Cup team against the Netherlands last month, she says the time is right for her to return. \"I'm ready, or else I wouldn't be here,\" she said. \"If I'm not ready now, I'm just never going to be ready. I feel in two months I'll be way better than I am now, but you have to start somewhere. I don't want to keep sitting on the sidelines and thinking about it.\" Williams can take encouragement from her performance in New York on Monday. Her serve looked threatening and she hit some menacing winners as she beat another returning player - Marion Bartoli - before losing to Zhang Shuai in the semi-finals. Media playback is not supported on this device Williams last appeared in a Grand Slam at the 2017 Australian Open. Victory over sister Venus in the final left her just one behind Margaret Court's all-time record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles. She has made no secret of the fact she is motivated by the thought of winning 25. And also by giving her daughter a meaningful chance to watch her play. \"I don't need any more motivation,\" Williams said. \"I have the best thing I could ever want right now. I've always been an extremely motivated person, but my main thing is that I would love for my daughter to be around with me doing great, and playing amazing, so that definitely gives me some motivation. \"I would have thought I would have retired six years ago, but I'm still here and I'm playing great, and I think I'll still be playing good.\" She added it was \"impossible\" to say how long she would continue to play for. Williams, who is unranked as she has spent more than 12 months away from the tour, has been drawn to play Zarina Diyas of Kazakhstan in the first round in Indian Wells. The match is likely to be played on Thursday evening, Californian time. She could play her sister Venus in the third round, but has understandably sounded a note of caution. After all, the former world number one only gave birth six months ago, and six weeks of that time was spent in bed as she recovered from emergency surgery. \"My expectations, I don't know what they are,\" said Williams. \"I can't go and say I expect to lose because that is something I will never say. It's just a little different. I'm just expecting to see where I am more than anything. \"This is a good time to start for the summer. If I want to play in those Grand Slams [the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open] and play well, I think now is the perfect time to start.\" The only mother to have won the Wimbledon singles title since World War One was Australia's Evonne Cawley (nee Goolagong) in 1980. Another motivating factor, should Williams ever need one. ",

Hooker Hartley, 31, has tightness in his calf and will be monitored before Thursday's team announcement. Exeter's Nowell rolled an ankle injury in training and will play no further part in the tournament. Bath flanker Sam Underhill has also been ruled out of the France game. The 21-year-old sustained a toe injury in training but could return for England's final game against Ireland. Nowell, 24, and Underhill have both featured off the bench in all three of England's matches so far in the championship, but have now returned to their clubs. According to England forwards coach Steve Borthwick, Northampton's Hartley and Exeter prop Harry Williams, 26, have reported muscle tightness, but at this stage both are expected to be fit. \"Dylan trained fully yesterday and just had a bit of tightness afterwards. There will be ongoing assessment on a daily basis,\" Borthwick told BBC 5 live. Luke Cowan-Dickie has been called up as \"precautionary cover\" for Hartley, while Kyle Sinckler is in camp as back-up to Williams. If Hartley is unable to recover then Jamie George is in line to start in Paris, with Owen Farrell taking over the captaincy. Sam Simmonds will come back into contention after returning from injury, while experienced flanker James Haskell is also set to be included in the matchday 23. Defending champions England are currently second in the table behind Ireland, having lost to Scotland at Murrayfield in their last outing. ",

The car, driven by Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne, broke down three times on day one of the final test in Barcelona. The first two failures were caused by a battery problem, the third a loss of hydraulic pressure. McLaren completed the fewest laps on Tuesday and Vandoorne was 12th fastest of the 13 drivers taking part. McLaren headed into the pre-season tests following their switch from Honda to Renault engines with hopes of competing for podium finishes this season. They split with Honda last season after three seasons of poor performance and reliability and claimed that they had a chassis that was on about the same level as Red Bull. They have expectations of competing this year with the four-time champions, who also use a Renault engine. \"We aren't overly concerned about the issues that we've faced today,\" said McLaren racing director Eric Boullier. \"It's obviously not the productive day we had planned, but the problems are the types of niggles that we almost hope and expect to face during testing, in order to prepare us properly for the season ahead. \"We are here to test, and today is what sometimes happens in testing. It's not ideal, and we would have liked more track time, but we're working on it, we're learning from it.\" It is always difficult to judge a team's actual competitive position from pre-season testing because the specification in which the cars are running is not made public. But, with three days of testing remaining before the first race in Australia on 23-25 March, the McLaren car's apparent lack of reliability and pace is a major concern. A succession of issues have restricted mileage in testing. Fernando Alonso lost a wheel after just six laps of the first day of testing last week because a nut had not been tightened properly. The following day Vandoorne was hit by overheating in the engine bay caused by a broken exhaust clip. The final two days of the first test were rendered largely useless by poor weather. The second test started with two early problems in the morning session on Tuesday - the car cut out on its way into the pits after an early run, and then after setting his first lap time, Vandoorne ground to a halt on the pit straight. He managed eight laps in total in the morning after the team managed to get the car back out just before the lunch break. Vandoorne had increased his tally to 38 laps when the hydraulic problem hit midway through the afternoon. The team were unable to get him out on track again. McLaren racing director Eric Boullier said at the end of last week's first test that doing a race distance this week was \"key\", but the team seem far from that at this stage. By comparison, Ferrari and Mercedes both did more than 160 laps - nearly three race distances - on Tuesday. If McLaren's problems continue, it would mean a fourth consecutive wasted season for two-time champion Fernando Alonso, who re-signed for McLaren last autumn in expectation of a better season. Alonso, winner of 32 grands prix and still regarded at the age of 36 as one of the greatest drivers of his era, left Ferrari at the end of 2014 having lost faith in their ability to win the title again before the end of his contract, which ran to 2016. But while the Italian team have remained Mercedes' closest challengers in the intervening period - and were title contenders last season - Alonso has been far worse off in the McLaren, his best results a handful of fifth places. McLaren's troubles have been put in stark relief by Honda's generally reliable running with new partners Toro Rosso, the Red Bull junior team. Toro Rosso driver Pierre Gasly ended the day fifth fastest, behind Sebastian Vettel's Ferrari, Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas, Red Bull's Max Verstappen and world champion Lewis Hamilton, who took over the Mercedes from Bottas at lunch time. However, Toro Rosso also hit trouble on Tuesday, the car failing to get out of the pits at all in the afternoon session. And Verstappen was another driver to stop on track in the afternoon. Vettel's fastest time of one minute 20.396 seconds was set on the 'medium' tyre and put him 0.2secs ahead of Bottas on the theoretically faster 'soft' tyre. Verstappen was just 0.053secs slower than the Mercedes on the medium. The opening race of the 2018 season is the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne's Albert Park on 23-25 March.

Guardiola has accepted an FA charge of \"wearing a political message\" for what he says is to support imprisoned politicians in his native Catalonia. Glenn has apologised for comparing the Star of David with symbols like the Nazi swastika, in discussing the issue. \"He didn't understand the reality,\" Guardiola said. \"I am pretty sure he does now.\" Glenn has described the ribbon as \"a political symbol, a symbol of Catalan independence\". But Guardiola said: \"It is not about independence. It is about people being in jail when they did nothing to deserve it.\" The FA took action when former Barcelona manager Guardiola wore the yellow ribbon pitchside - he is free to wear it elsewhere - during Man City's FA Cup fifth-round defeat at Wigan on 19 February. A hearing has been requested, with a date still to be set. ",

        "content": "Six months after the worst hurricane in living memory brought devastation to the Caribbean, there are still UK citizens sleeping in a government shelter with nowhere to call home. In the middle of a basketball gymnasium, Stanton \"Mikey\" Robinson, 30, sat with all of his worldly possessions. Fighting back tears he explained his dream of having a small apartment with a small table and a single bed. \"I don't like it in here. I don't feel comfortable in this place,\" he told us. \"(tell the government to) Please help me.\" Twenty metres away on what's meant to be spectator seating, Makeba Hesky, 34, sat nursing her 10-month-old child. A large hole - unpatched since the hurricane - in the roof of the BVI Sports Complex allowed rain and light to pour into the otherwise unlit gymnasium. \"It seems to me like everybody just give up on us,\" Hesky said. Hesky and Robinson are among the approximately 20 people still living in the shelter who have faced repeated deadlines to move out despite nowhere to go. Many more are living with friends and family. Outside the sports complex and across the islands, signs of Irma's (destructive) visit can still be seen everywhere - not least at the island's government building. Most of the structure's windows are boarded, awaiting replacement. Inside, the island's premier, Orlando Smith, works from a sparse office while repairmen are still labouring to repair the extensive damage. Asked if he could guarantee that those in the shelter would not be thrown out with nowhere to go, Smith told the BBC, \"that's why they're still there\u2026 we're looking to provide the necessary accommodation for them\". The \"biggest priority is housing - getting those roofs back on, getting people in homes,\" he said, speaking outside his office. \"Then of course, there is the matter of the economy. We've got to get that economy back up and running.\" Economically speaking, the islands' tourism sector took the biggest hit. Few know that better than Roselyn Hill. She like many others here worked in the tourism industry for decades, only to be laid off when Irma damaged the resorts and attractions at which they worked. \"Peak season a couple of years ago - sometimes it looks like more boats than water. You can't see the water for the yachts,\" she said, standing on a cruise ship dock that (now lies) laid empty. Two of the biggest cruise companies have stopped bringing ships to the BVI, and the reduced numbers of tourists has meant a slow recovery for the tourism industry. \"It's not a good feeling you know back then to compare it to now,\" she said. \"When we see a cruise ship, it's like light\". The hardships have caused many to question whether the United Kingdom did enough to support those on the islands. Across town, Rita Plunkett was doing her washing on a day off. Stepping inside, she explained how windows and doors to her home were broken during the storm and pointed to massive water damage to a bedroom ceiling. On the roof of her apartment building, bits of UK Aid-branded tarpaulin stood between her and regular rainstorms. She said the UK's response came up short. She received, \"no aid, apart from the six bottles of water I got - that was it,\" she said. It was a common perception we have heard here over the past few days - that other than the work done by British troops in the month after the storm, more could have been done. Upon returning from a preaching trip to the island of Virgin Gorda, Bishop John Cline went a step further than most we spoke with. \"When we did need them to show that we are truly a child of the United Kingdom, I think they disappointed us,\" he said. \"It changed our view in terms of a relationship, to saying 'are we really a part of you or is that just in name only?'\" But the island's British governor, Gus Jaspert, says he's proud of the UK's contribution to the BVI's recovery - noting that much of Britain's work has been behind the scenes. \"The UK had a very first visible phase, which was military out and about. People saw that a lot more,\" he said. \"Behind the scenes, the UK has been supporting with infrastructure, supporting with technical advisors in each of the key departments and ministries\u2026 as well as grants on specific projects - both on immediate needs, but also on longer term. \"(Together) we've got the electricity back on. We've got businesses back open. We've got all children getting educated, and key services are back up and running,\" he said, while acknowledging that much work still remained. The governor is right about progress being made. Given the scale of the destruction even removing debris has been a huge feat, albeit one that is still ongoing. The island's main high school lies in ruin. Many other schools appear damaged. Harbours are littered with overturned and abandoned boats - some boats lay where they washed up on land. Roads are littered with potholes. And some debris remains strewn about. And now, with hurricane season less than 100 days away, many island residents are worried about what the next storm may bring.

        "content": "Dating app Bumble has banned members from posing with guns in their profile pictures, following the school shooting in Parkland, Florida. The company said it would screen new and existing photos and remove pictures featuring weapons from the app. However, military and law enforcement officers in uniform will be allowed to show weapons in their photos. Bumble said it was taking \"an opportunity to make our platform safer\". \"As mass shootings continue to devastate communities across the country, it's time to state unequivocally that gun violence is not in line with our values, nor do these weapons belong on Bumble,\" the company said in a statement. In February, 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Since then, survivors have campaigned for stricter gun control in the US. Bumble says it has 30 million members worldwide, and the company already employs 5,000 moderators. They will now filter out photos of guns in addition to nudity, knives and hate speech. However, photos displayed on a Bumble profile from a linked Instagram account will not be screened. \"Online behaviour can both mirror and predict how people treat each other in the real world. Bumble has a responsibility to our users and a larger goal to encourage accountability offline,\" the company said in a statement. The app's founder Whitney Wolfe Herd acknowledged that the ban would affect law-abiding gun owners, hobbyists and hunters. \"It's a very tricky battle we've chosen to take on, but I'd rather pursue this than just ignore it,\" she told the New York Times. The company has also donated $100,000 (\u00a372,000) to the March For Our Lives campaign, which was founded by survivors of the Parkland shooting. \"We stand with them, and join them in working towards a non-violent future,\" the company said.

        "content": "Fans of entrepreneur Elon Musk have been targeted in an emerging crypto-currency scam. The scammers pose as celebrities on Twitter and claim to be giving away crypto-cash such as Bitcoin or Ether to their fans. They ask people to send them a small amount of crypto-currency to qualify for the giveaway, but victims do not get any bitcoins back. Twitter has not yet removed the imposter Elon Musk account. How does the scam work?\nThe scammers impersonate well-known personalities on Twitter by copying their profile pictures and choosing usernames very similar to the genuine accounts. They then post replies to popular tweets made by the genuine celebrity. This gives their nefarious messages prominence on Twitter. Typically, the scammers ask people to send them small amounts of crypto-currency, offering to send a larger amount back as part of a giveaway. The scam can be convincing, because at first glance it looks like the celebrity has replied to their own tweet. However, the fake profiles can be detected as they do not have Twitter's \"verified\" badge and often have no followers and have never posted before. Amplified by bots\nOn Tuesday, an account posing as Elon Musk using the username @elonmuskik tweeted that the entrepreneur was going to \"give away\" 3,000 Ether, worth about \u00a31.7m. The scam was amplified by several automated accounts known as bots. The bots had been dormant since September 2017 and had never posted before, but came to life to chat among themselves about the supposed crypto-cash giveaway. \"S\u043e nice! Just sent and immediately received back. You're super fast,\" one said. The founder of the Ethereum (ETH) crypto-currency Vitalik Buterin has been targeted by the scam so many times that he has changed his username to \"No I'm not giving away ETH\". \"No, I'm not giving away ETH... y'all are getting nothing,\" he tweeted. Twitter has been criticised for taking a long time to tackle the problem of bots on its platform. It told the BBC: \"We're aware of this form of manipulation and are proactively implementing a number of signals to prevent these types of accounts from engaging with others in a deceptive manner.\" At the time of publication, the fake Elon Musk post had been up on the platform for 11 hours and remained visible.

        "content": "Efforts to create an automated UK drone-tracking system pave the way for commercial operators to fly unmanned aircraft regularly over longer distances than is currently possible. At present, owners are required to keep drones within their own line of sight unless they have been given special permission to do otherwise. The new system is being co-developed by the air traffic control service Nats and a start-up, Altitude Angel. They aim to launch it in 2019 or 2020. The aim is to keep the lower-level air space, to which drones would still be restricted, safe. That means preventing drones crashing into each other as well as eliminating the risk to passenger jets and other manned aircraft, which are already tracked. \"This technology will enable us to be able to create a single picture so we can see where everyone is intending to fly and where they are already flying,\" the head of drones at Nats, Andrew Sage, told the BBC. \"Altitude Angel has a lot of expertise in data management that we don't have within Nats... and we are deploying that technology so we can react more quickly.\" He added that the initiative should also help tackle the number of near-misses between drones and planes, which have been on the rise. The two organisations had previously collaborated to develop an app used to provide guidance to drone pilots about safe places to fly. Drone deliveries\nNats says it has already had conversations with the drone industry and believes trials of the new system could begin within the UK before the end of 2018. Unmanned aircraft would still need to be fitted with technology to allow their locations to be shared, as well as sensors and software to react independently to collision threats. Mr Sage predicted that blood deliveries and search-and-rescue missions would be among early uses of drones that could fly beyond their operators' sightlines. But another expert said companies such as Amazon might be keen to shift parts of their logistics operations off the road. \"Drones flying beyond line of sight would be a very big deal - the scope of operations just changes dramatically,\" commented Dr Ravi Vaidyanathan, from Imperial College London. \"Goods deliveries would be one example of how it could be put to use, because products could be sent from a warehouse to a distant location. \"One could argue that if a drone has to be limited to being within line of sight, as at present, then it's probably easier to drop the package off yourself.\" ",

        "content": "Washington State has signed a law that bars service providers from blocking websites or offering fast lane net access to companies willing to pay. It is in direct opposition to the Federal Communications Commission regulator, which has moved to roll back net neutrality. At least 20 other states are considering similar legislation. Some states have banned agencies from doing business with broadband providers that don't uphold net neutrality. Net neutrality is the principle that all internet traffic should be treated equally. In December the FCC voted to repeal the rules, in what was seen as a major victory for the telecoms industry. Chairman Aji Pai argued that it would lead to greater investment in broadband infrastructure because service providers would have new avenues to make money. But a vocal and growing list of opponents, including tech firms and public interest groups, have promised to mount legal challenges to preserve the rules which they say are at the heart of what makes for a fair internet. Free flow\nWashington State governor Jay Inslee said at the signing ceremony: \"We've seen the power of an open internet. It allows a student in Washington to connect with researchers all around the world - \u200aor a small business to compete in the global marketplace. \"It has allowed the free flow of information and ideas in one of the greatest demonstrations of free speech in our history.\" The decision in Washington means that internet service providers may have to have a different set of policies there compared to other states that they operate in. Net neutrality supporters in Congress are trying to overturn the new law through legislation. California is also considering its own state law to preserve net neutrality. Senator Scott Wiener introduced the legislation in January, saying net neutrality \"was essential to our 21st century democracy\". \"We won't let the Trump-led FCC dismantle our right to a free and open internet, and we won't let them create a system where internet providers can favour websites and services based on who pays more money.\" The final draft of the rules takes place on April 23, which will be the day the repeal takes effect. The FCC has not responded to requests for comment. ",

Former White House intern Monica Lewinsky is currently the only female among the 22 confirmed speakers in the RSA conference keynote line-up. Rival conference Our Security Advocates (OURSA) said its one-day event would feature more women speakers. RSA curator, Sandra Toms, said not all its speakers had been yet disclosed. The RSA Conference is one of the biggest gatherings on the cyber-security calendar and runs from 15-20 April in San Francisco. Around 45,000 people attend each year. Rival event OURSA will take place in the same city on 17 April. It will have capacity for just a few hundred and, according to its Facebook page, all tickets are sold. It also plans to livestream the event. It will be hosted by security firm Cloudflare, which has a female co-founder. Other sponsors include Google, Facebook and Snap. Popcorn offer\nBacklash to the RSA gathering began shortly after its speaker list was revealed. Monica Lewinsky, as the sole female, has no experience in cyber-security but has spoken previously at conferences about internet trolling. In a tweet, Facebook's chief security officer proposed a list of 16 women speakers RSA could invite. He also offered to \"hand out popcorn\" if someone organised a rival event.

        "content": "The Open Rights Group says it fears a data breach is \"inevitable\" as the deadline approaches for a controversial change in the way people in the UK access online pornography. Details of an age verification tool developed by a major porn site owner were revealed at the weekend. From April 2018, porn site visitors in the UK will have to prove they are aged 18 or over to access adult material. The regulation is designed to protect children from explicit content. It is part of the UK government's Digital Economy Act. MindGeek, which runs sites including PornHub, YouPorn and RedTube, said its AgeID age verification tool had been in use in Germany since 2015. It said its software would use \"third-party age-verification companies\" to authenticate the age of those signing in. AgeID spokesman James Clark told the BBC there were multiple verification methods that could be used - including credit card, mobile SMS, passport and driving licence - but that it was not yet clear which would be compliant with the law. AgeID would be made commercially available to all porn sites accessible within the UK, MindGeek said, and would be offered free to independent UK studios, producers and bloggers. Once registered, users would be able to access multiple sites across multiple devices without logging in again, it said. MindGeek also said it would not store any data itself. \"We have created a tool to comply with the impending UK legislation, which both protects children from stumbling across adult content, and enables those of legal age to securely and privately access adult websites through a one-time verification process,\" said Mr Clark. However, the tool will be effective only for those who go directly to porn sites rather than use search engines or follow social media hashtags that include pornographic content. These could be blocked by the parental controls offered by most internet service providers. Mr Clark said the scope of the regulations were a matter for the regulator, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), but that AgeID would work across MindGeek's network and all others that signed up to use it. Treasure trove\nMyles Jackman, legal director of the Open Rights Group, said while MindGeek had said it would not hold or store data, it was not clear who would - and by signing in people would be revealing their sexual preferences. \"If the age verification process continues in its current fashion, it's a once-in-a-lifetime treasure trove of private information,\" he said. \"If it gets hacked, can British citizens ever trust the government again with their data? \"The big issues here are privacy and security.\" Mr Jackman said it would drive more people to use virtual private networks (VPNs) - which mask a device's geographical location to circumvent local restrictions - or the anonymous web browser Tor. \"It is brutally ironic that when the government is trying to break all encryption in order to combat extremism, it is now forcing people to turn towards the dark web,\" he said. The chief executive of the BBFC, David Austin, said age verification was already in place for other services, including some video-on-demand sites. \"This is not about stopping adults from watching pornography that is legal; it is about making the internet a safer place for children,\" he said. \"There are a range of methods for verifying whether someone is 18 or over, and we expect to see a number of solutions offered by providers to give people different ways to verify their age.\" ",

        "content": "The European Space Agency and London's Inmarsat company are moving to the next phase of their project to improve the efficiency of European airspace. The pair's Iris programme would see air traffic controllers route planes via robust and secure satellite data links. At the moment, this management involves VHF radio voice messages - a system that will soon likely reach capacity. Additional technologies are therefore needed to cope with the expected growth in air traffic over the coming decades. Passenger demand is currently increasing by more than 5% a year globally with the European market among the busiest. Iris, which will now see a large-scale demonstration over the next 36 months, should help speed up the transmission of messages between controllers and cockpits; and ultimately aims to make full 4D trajectory management possible. \"Flight paths are defined by latitude, longitude, altitude and time - and Iris, because of its performance, allows us to determine those waypoints to plus or minus 2-3 seconds,\" explained Captain Mary McMillan, vice president of aviation safety and operational services at Inmarsat Aviation. \"With resilient and ubiquitous satellite downlink frequencies, controllers and aircraft will have the confidence to know that planes will be where they say they're going to be at the prescribed time - and that will enable us to put more aircraft into the available airspace and do it safely,\" she told BBC News. Iris has been in an R&D phase for a number of years, with demonstrations restricted to some small experimental flights. This next phase, funded through a \u20ac42m contract from Esa to Inmarsat, will see the technology prepared and proven on a larger number of aircraft fitted with the necessary communications equipment. The messages will be sent over Inmarsat's L-band network of telecommunications spacecraft that sit high above the Earth. If all goes well, Iris would then be available for wide-scale adoption in the 2020s. Esa and Inmarsat have had to show that not only are satellite links robust and broad enough to carry the digital routing messages, but that the system as a whole can resist hacking. \"It has to be safe, but it also has to be trusted and resilient for cyber security,\" said Carlo Elia, the head of the telecommunications technologies, products and systems department at the space agency. Iris is a key element of the European Commission's Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research programme, also known as Sesar. This is developing a number of technologies to streamline the coordination of flights. At the moment, it is thought more than 40km is added to the average flight in Europe because routing is not optimised. If this can be improved there are obvious gains to be had for passengers in shorter flight times, and for airline operators in reduced fuel-use and emissions. Iris is one of a number of public-private partnerships that Esa now runs out of its telecoms HQ in Harwell, Oxfordshire. \"The agency aims always to help improve the competitiveness of Europe's satcom industry and to explore ways to enlarge markets. Iris is a typical case,\" said Carlo Elia. \"The other motivation for us of course is the clear societal and environmental benefits that come from such a project,\" he told BBC News. As well as Inmarsat, more than 30 companies across Europe are working on Iris, including prime partners CGI UK and Thales Alenia Space, Italy.

        "content": "Reddit has become the latest social-media platform to admit that Russian propaganda was used on its site during the 2016 US presidential election. It follows leaks from news site The Daily Beast showing a Russian troll farm active on the website. Co-founder Steve Huffman said that it had removed \"a few hundred accounts\" suspected of being of Russian origin. In a blogpost, he said \"indirect propaganda\", which was more complex to spot and stop, was the biggest issue. \"For example, the Twitter account @TEN_GOP is now known to be run by a Russian agent. Its tweets were amplified by thousands of Reddit users, and sadly, from everything we can tell, these users are mostly American and appear to be unwittingly promoting Russian propaganda.\" Conspiracy theories\nMr Huffman added: \"I believe the biggest risk we face as Americans is our own ability to discern reality from nonsense, and this is a burden we all bear. \"I wish there was a solution as simple as banning all propaganda, but it's not that easy. Between truth and fiction are a thousand shades of grey. \"It's up to all of us\u2014Redditors, citizens, journalists\u2014to work through these issues.\" The @TEN_GOP account appeared to be run by Republicans in Tennessee. It tweeted a mix of pro-Trump content and conspiracy theories, as well as more obvious fake news stories. The Daily Beast investigation suggested no outright support of any particular candidate or viewpoint and concluded that Russia's aim was to provoke and divide Americans on the internet and, as a result, in the physical world too. Social media 'weapon'\nSocial media platforms are under increased scrutiny from the US Congress over the issue of Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Facebook has given the Senate Intelligence Committee thousands of ads believed to have been purchased by Russian agents. The Washington Post reported that Reddit was now likely to be questioned over its involvement in the \"weaponisation of social media\" during the election. Special counsel Robert Mueller has charged 13 Russians with interfering in the US election, all of whom are linked to troll farm the Internet Research Agency. Meanwhile, pressure is mounting on Reddit to clean up the content on its platform. In February, it banned a group that was generating fake porn - imagery and videos that superimpose a person's face over an explicit photo or video without permission. This week, it emerged that another subreddit was sharing images of dead babies and animals being harmed. Mr Huffman said the company was aware of the group, which currently has nearly 19,000 subscribers, and that the community was \"under review\". ",

        "content": "The inventor of the wind-up radio, Trevor Baylis, has died aged 80, the manager of his company has confirmed. David Bunting said Mr Baylis from Twickenham, south-west London, died on Monday of natural causes after a long illness. Mr Baylis invented the Baygen clockwork radio in 1991. He was appointed CBE in 2015 after campaigning to make theft of intellectual property a white-collar crime. He said chatting with the Queen at the ceremony was \"like catching up with an old mate\". Mr Baylis had also worked as a film and TV stuntman and an aquatic showman. He had been seriously debilitated, having suffered from Crohn's disease, Mr Bunting said. Mr Baylis was previously awarded the OBE for his radio, which he designed after seeing a documentary about Aids in Africa that suggested educational radio programmes could help tackle the spread of the virus. He had said he received almost none of the profits from the invention because people took advantage of patent laws to sell other versions of it. In later life Mr Baylis advised other inventors on developing their ideas, and campaigned against theft of intellectual property. Mr Bunting, who runs Trevor Baylis Brands, said Mr Baylis had no living relatives. Analysis - Prof Will Stewart, The Institution of Engineering and Technology\nTrevor Baylis' wind-up radios could work anywhere. They were sold in the UK, but we weren't the intended market. What made them important was that they were designed for a Third-World application. They were aimed at Africa and places where mains electric power and access to batteries was a problem. The original one had a clockwork-like mechanism with a very ingenious double-spiral spring. It wound off one pulley onto another and would run for relatively short periods of time - about 15 minutes. Later versions lasted longer and were powered by rechargeable batteries. They were charged up with a crankable dynamo or could be plugged into the mains or solar energy panels, if available. Nelson Mandela would say fine things about them, and they won Trevor Baylis various prizes. But while the Baygens certainly sold and were used, their biggest impact was probably that they had been made by a First World engineer who cared about the Third World. There are now all sorts of inventions aimed at the developing world and it's a relatively common thing for young engineers to dedicate themselves to, but that didn't always used to be the case. I think Trevor Baylis deserves considerable credit for having kicked that off and for having served as an inspiration to many other young engineers and inventors. ",

        "content": "Police in Iceland have arrested 11 people suspected of stealing more than 600 computers that were being used to mine crypto-currencies, reports AP. The computers were stolen during four raids on data centres around Iceland. The country is a popular location for data centres because almost 100% of the power generated there comes from renewable sources. Two of the suspects are in custody, and nine have been released on bail. The stolen servers have not been recovered. The AP newswire said police were now contacting internet service provider (ISPs), electricians and storage units, asking them to report sudden spikes in power usage or other signs the stolen servers had been reconnected. The value of the stolen computers has been put at $2m (\u00a31.45m). In February, Iceland's HS Orka power generation company said it was seeing an \"exponential\" rise in the amount of energy being used in these data centres to mine and verify crypto-currency transactions. For the first time, it said, the energy required for coin mining had exceeded that used by Iceland's 340,000 inhabitants to power their homes. ",

        "content": "At a trendy east London bar, a group of body hackers are putting forward their reasons for human augmentation to a packed audience of mainly under-35s, many of whom are sporting piercings and tattoos. Putting a chip under your skin is not so very different from getting a piercing or tattoo, argued one of the panellists - except there was often less blood. For some, transhumanism - the theory that the human race can evolve beyond its physical and mental limitations with the help of technology - is a crucial part of the advancement of society. Bio-hacker Lepht Anonym has nine implants and strongly believes what she does will benefit humankind as well as her own curiosity. But she admits it can be painful. \"The magnets in my fingers really, really hurt. They hurt so much that your vision goes white for a bit. Really, really painful.\" The magnets allow her to sense electromagnetic radiation so she can tell if a device is on or off, whether a microwave is running and identify where power lines are. All of which, she admits, is \"not hugely useful\". She also has a chip under her skin that lets her interact with her phone and unlock doors. She hopes that the \"primitive results\" she has achieved can be used by other, more skilled people, to build something better. \"The bio-hacking community is a co-operative. It is about improving the quality of life for people but in a practical way.\" Hygiene issues\nNot everyone is a fan of the trend. Andreas Sjostrom, who leads CapGemini's global mobility practice, had an implant in 2015 which allowed him to download his customer number from airline tickets and get through security gates with a swipe of his hand. It got him noticed by security staff at the airport and worked but he has since become more cynical about the technology. \"In order for this to be widely used or adopted it has to improve on the current situation,\" he said. \"The hardware that reads such chips is designed for a flat surface such as you'd find in a card,\" he explained, adding that chips in hands are often not recognised by the readers. \"And, if everyone is pressing their hands on the reader, that is less hygienic.\" It is estimated that more than 10,000 people around the world have chip implants in their bodies, making it far from mainstream but clearly a growing trend. The current range of implants includes magnets that are installed into fingertips, radio frequency identification chips (RFiD) implanted in hands, and even LED lights that can shine beneath the skin. Chips used for opening doors carry a unique serial number the can be read by a device attached to whatever you want to open and one chip can carry multiple numbers meaning you do not need a separate chip for everything you want to access. Amal Graafstra provides such implants via his firm Dangerous Things and thinks there are three good reasons to have an implant. \"We all carry with us keys, wallet and phone. These are major burdens, they are so important for modern life but everyone hates carrying them. \"With a simple implant that uses less energy and carries less risk than an ear-piercing, you can replace them.\" He is able to access not only his house but his car via the implant under his skin, although he admits that getting the device to work with his car required \"a bit of hacking\". But he envisions a future where chips can do far more - and that, he predicts, will attract more people to the community of bio-hacking. \"If someone could use an implant to get on the train, buy coffee, secure their computer, secure their data, get into their house, drive a car - all of these possible applications will compel a lot more adoption.\" For Matt Eagles, the implant he has in his brain is not a luxury so much as a necessity to cope with the Parkinson's disease he has had since he was a child. He has two 15cm electrodes that run deep into his brain and create two bumps on his head which he affectionately refers to as \"baby giraffe horns\". The implants are attached to a pulse generator in his chest, which disrupts the electrical signals to his brain and allows him to walk. \"They have given me back my dignity. When you struggle to turn over in bed at night or can't get out of bed to go to the bathroom, to be suddenly able to do so is a huge plus.\" It has also given him back confidence to pursue his love of photography - he was an accredited football photographer at the 2012 Olympics - and, perhaps most importantly, he has got married. Many regard medicine as being the real mainstream application for bio-hacking, from cochlear implants which improve hearing loss to smart pills that can be ingested and access, analyse and manipulate bodily functions. Some bio-hackers are ready to go one step further. In October 2017, Josiah Zayner, who has a doctorate in biochemistry and molecular biophysics from the University of Chicago, injected his arm with DNA from a gene-editing tool called Crispr. It is a stunt that he has since said he regrets but his attempt to edit his own genes - in this case to trigger a genetic change in his cells to increase muscle mass - made headlines at the time, largely around the ethics of such experimentation. \"There is a continuum between therapy and enhancement and it is difficult to draw the line between where medicine ends and enhancement begins,\" said Prof John Harris, an ethicist from the University of Manchester. \"As for gene editing the tools are available and relatively cheap and easy to use, but people would be extremely ill-advised to try it.\" There has also been objections on religious grounds from some, with Mr Sjostrom receiving negative feedback from a group in the Christian community. \"They see implantable technology and assume the end of times are here and that it is the mark of the beast. It is important to know how to deal with this technology from a theological point of view.\" ",

        "content": "\"Video game violence and glorification must be stopped - it is creating monsters!\" Six years after Donald Trump tweeted his views on video game violence, it seems he is looking to take action. In a White House briefing following the Florida school shooting, when press secretary Sarah Sanders was asked about the president's policy on gun control she said Donald Trump will \"be meeting with members of the video game industry to see what they can do on that front\". Ms Sanders response has been widely discussed on social media, with some criticising the president for pointing the finger at fictional guns, rather than actual firearms. You may also like: Some people wondered if they had inadvertently stumbled into the past, as the relationship between video games and violent behaviour has long been debated in the media. Columbine happened when I was a freshman in high school and we had to go through the whole rigamole of \"Is it the Matrix? Is it goths? Is it videogames?\". I am glad to know that in ALMOST TWENTY YEARS, the conversation barely moved forward one jot. https://t.co/00AUAr1scy End of Twitter post by @amandawtwong One person asked why the White House was discussing video games, saying that Trump \"has plenty of ideas for ending mass shootings, except gun control\". While artist and director Rob Sheridan, known for his work with music group Nine Inch Nails, wondered if game industry executives might suggest similar measures. I hope the video game executives are like \"yeah, thanks for talking to us, since you asked our opinion you should ban AR-15s.\" End of Twitter post by @rob_sheridan This was followed by Family Guy creator Seth McFarlane pointing out that \"other countries without America's gun problem also have video games\". And one person tried to find the funny side of things, re-writing Australia's 1996 gun ban for comic effect. people are making fun of Trump for this but Australia got rid of their video games after a mass shooting in 1996 and haven't had one since End of Twitter post by @thomas_violence But some people praised Trump for taking action, with one person saying the president is \"doing more and engaging more than Obama did\", and another applauding Trump for addressing the \"surrounding issues\" of guns. Meanwhile, Twitter users have begun to question exactly who it is that Donald Trump intends on meeting. Video game journalist Jason Schreier tweeted that the Entertainment Software Association, whose members include many of the largest game publishers in the United States, says neither the ESA nor its members have been invited to a meeting. And if a meeting does happen, one person wondered how the meeting could go ahead without causing contention. Who is he going to meet with? Activision? EA? ID? Bungie? Valve? Nintendo? Also, since the video game industry has spent literally DECADES rejecting the idea that they\u2019re to blame for violence, this sounds like a pretty contentious meeting in the making. https://t.co/YD5J1ejsnr End of Twitter post by @jackmjenkins ",

        "content": "The company behind the hit mobile game Angry Birds has closed its London studio, after warning its profits were likely to fall. Rovio's head of games, Wilhelm Taht, also resigned on Friday, leaving chief executive Kati Levoranta in charge. The Finnish games company has warned that its brand licensing revenues could decline 40% this year. It has blamed tough competition and higher marketing costs for the poor outlook. Rovio's London studio was opened in 2017 and the company went public in September with a valuation of \u00a3786m. But on 22 February, the Finnish games maker issued a profit warning that caused its shares to drop by 50%. Announcing the closure of its London studio, Rovio said it wanted to concentrate on its studios in Finland and Sweden. The company had employed seven games developers in London. It\u2019s with a heavy heart that I tell you the @rovio London Studio is going to close. Sad times for us, but I look back with genuine pride at my time with these talented and kind people. Been quite a ride. pic.twitter.com/EYxO3ZZmaA End of Twitter post by @Sorrell Rovio saw rapid growth after it launched Angry Birds in 2009, but it made a significant loss in 2015 and cut a third of its staff. In 2016, its Angry Birds movie earned $350 million (\u00a3254m) in cinemas and helped revive sales of the game. A sequel is expected in 2019. ",

        "content": "Twitter has asked for help in devising a \"health check\" to measure its contribution to public conversation. It said it hoped to work with \"outside experts\" and is inviting proposals. Its chief executive, Jack Dorsey, said the platform's \"instant, public, global messaging\" had \"real-world negative consequences\" that Twitter had neither fully predicted nor understood. Twitter has repeatedly been criticised for the amount of abuse and propaganda posted by some of its users. In support of its new stance, Mr Dorsey tweeted a link to an organisation called Cortico. It identifies \"shared attention\", \"shared reality\" (which it describes as \"using the same facts\"), variety of opinion and reception to different views as indicators of a healthy public conversation. Lisa-Maria Neudert, from the Oxford Internet Institute, said it was a positive step to see Twitter prepared to share its data with researchers and fund their work, but questioned how the measurements might be made. \"I'm not sure if you can measure health of a discourse,\" she told the BBC. \"If the shared topic of discourse is a terrible propaganda message that's not very healthy.\" 'Not proud'\nHowever, Ms Neudert said it was a good move for Twitter. \"This is Twitter's way of saying 'we realise our platform has problems and we have to do things about it',\" she said. \"It's not just propaganda and meddling but there is also a hostile community on Twitter.\" Mr Dorsey admitted that the firm had found it difficult to manage the way its platform was used. \"We aren't proud of how people have taken advantage of our service, or our inability to address it fast enough,\" Mr Dorsey wrote on Twitter. In a series of tweets he said that the firm had focused on removing offensive content rather than trying to encourage \"more healthy debate\". Explaining Twitter's decision to seek a health check, he said: \"If you want to be able to improve something, you have to be able to measure it\". Twitter has seen a variety of high profile accounts closed, often by celebrities, because of persistent trolling. The Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones left in 2016 after a barrage of abuse following the release of the remake of the movie, which attracted criticism because of its all-female cast. She has since returned. The singer Ed Sheeran has been another example of someone famous abandoning Twitter. On Thursday, British chef and activist Jack Monroe left Twitter \"for the good of my mental health\". \"I have been in enough abusive relationships to recognise gas-lighting, coercion and bullying, and my personal relationships are suffering as a result of what I experience on here every day,\" Monroe wrote.

        "content": "Is smartphone hardware treading water while industrial designers wait for bendy screens and other flexible, futuristic components to make more radical models possible? And will sales continue to decline until they do? Samsung is casting a long shadow over this year's Mobile World Congress. The technology industry get-together in Barcelona is set to be dominated by the launch of its Galaxy S9 and S9+ handsets. The reaction from many rivals - including Huawei, HTC and LG - appears to have been to hold off their own flagship launches until later in the year. Based on \"leaks\", the S9 looks to be another rectangular, rigid product with an almost-all glass front and sleek metal back. Samsung's own teaser campaign has centred on its camera's capabilities rather than a radical form. Of the few other new phones expected, speculation has focused on how many lenses they will feature, where their fingerprint sensors will be placed, their display dimensions and whether they will retain a headphone jack, rather than any expectation of a major leap forward. Asus Zenfone 5 Lite - quad cam (2 x 20MP selfie + 2 x 16MP rear) FHD+ pic.twitter.com/819mlsLJm7 End of Twitter post by @evleaks \"The tragedy is that we had two decades of incredible innovation with flip-phones, candy-bar phones, sliders, round phones, square phones - all kinds of different things,\" said Ben Wood, from the consultancy CCS Insight. \"But the world changed in 2007 when Steve Jobs pulled the iPhone out of his pocket, and had what became the dominant design. \"We've since gravitated to the black rectangle with a touchscreen as the form factor of choice, and it feels like we've now reached a technology plateau where firms compete by offering marginal changes around the edges.\" Even so, there does appear to be an appetite for something \"a bit different\". The big story from last year's MWC was the Nokia 3310. The \"reimagined\" version of the Finnish company's classic handset had both physical number keys and a screen that bulged at its bottom. Its manufacturer, HMD Global, struggled to meet demand when it went on sale, despite several critical reviews. More revolutionary still, Lenovo has previously shown off a foldable phone concept that wrapped around the wrist. And Samsung has exhibited a prototype with a roll-out display. Both prompted lots of online chatter but have yet to be turned into commercial products. But change for change's sake can be a mistake. Two generations of LG's curved-screened Flex smartphones left many consumers confused as to what benefit the design had. And the South Korean company quickly retreated from the G5's ability to pop off its bottom to allow bolt-on hardware modules to be added, after sales disappointed. Pixel planner\nIt's somewhat telling about the current state of smartphone design that when the creative lead of Google's Pixel 2 discussed his work with the BBC, much of the conversation was dedicated to its colour schemes. \"On the panda one [there's a] very bold, very expressive black-and-white colourway, with... a spark of optimistic colour in the orange power button,\" Alberto Villarreal said. The Mexico-born designer said he had been excited by recent trends in the fashion industry, and in particular the way people were combining formal items with athletics wear. \"The mix-and-match of those neutral tones, with some sparks of colour that make it more sporty, are things we definitely looked at for inspiration,\" he said. When it came to the rest of the design, Mr Villarreal says he took a less-is-more approach. \"One thing that we been very careful about is making sure that when you look at the phone from the front, the attention of the user is focused on the screen. \"So [it was about] removing anything that is distracting from that. \"We have no branding, no buttons. And even details like the front-facing stereo speakers [is] something that we are treating very discreetly, blending with the black front. \"Even the bezels of the phone are black.\" Mr Villarreal declined to discuss how flexible components and other innovations might affect future designs. But he did say the public should be sceptical when they read reports about technology companies making last-minute hardware changes. \"We were were working on the [Pixel 2] before we had released the previous one,\" he said. \"In order to manufacture a product in high-volume, you have to start the pre-production quite a few months before. \"So, I cannot think of major changes that could happen to a product very close to the launch date.\" Handset-makers may currently be more occupied dreaming up new artificial intelligence features and augmented reality capabilities than trying to rethink how mobiles look in the hand. But recent shipment figures indicate many consumers don't see these features as compelling reasons to upgrade. IDC recently reported the global market was down 6.3% over the October-to-December quarter in 2017 compared with the same three months the previous year, while Strategy Analytics put the fall at 8.8%. China - the world's biggest market - represented a particular black spot. Local demand for smartphones suffered a 14% year-on-year plunge, according to Canalys. While absorbing those figures, it's worth noting that the data would have been even worse had Apple not released the iPhone X - a device that at least looked different to its predecessors, even if it too conformed to the current minimalistic aesthetic trend. \"Hardware is always the easiest thing to sell - if it looks different you get consumers attention, and then you build from there,\" said Carolina Milanesi, a consumer technology analyst at Creative Strategies. \"Trying to get someone into a store for something that looks the same as last year is difficult, even if it has new things to offer.\" She added that shop workers often struggled to explain new artificial intelligence and cloud-based facilities, while many consumers had proved suspicious of the privacy implications. Return of the flip\nThat's not to say there aren't some companies attempting something out of the ordinary. UK-based Bullit Group - which previously designed a Kodak-branded phone whose rear resembled a compact camera - has a new rugged CAT phone with a smell sensor, and is also promising to unveil a Land Rover-inspired handset at this year's MWC. Movie camera-maker Red is developing the Hydrogen One for later in the year. The phone promises a new type of \"holographic display\" and is intended to have a variety of camera-based modules attached to its back. And Samsung itself recently launched a modern take on the flip-phone, in China - the W2018 - with screens on both its inside and outside as well as a physical dial-pad. It is, however, expected to cost upwards of $3,000 (\u00a32,140) - an idiosyncratic look, it seems, can merit an extraordinary price.

        "content": "Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian wants emojis for interracial couples. The tech boss and husband of tennis champion Serena Williams is backing Tinder's petition to Unicode to introduce a wider range of emojis for couples. Currently only the original yellow skin tone is available for the 34 emojis for relationships and families. \"We want our kids to have emojis that look like their parents,\" Alexis is reported to have said. \"[Emoji] are the universal language of the internet and should reflect the modern world where interracial relationships are normal.\" The Unicode Consortium is a non-profit body which reviews and develops emoji standards - including making things more inclusive. There's a specific request that three skin tones - light, medium, and dark skin tones - be added to each face in the couple with heart and kissing emoji. This is despite the emoji keyboard now having six skin tones to choose from on emojis which show an individual's face. Unicode then has to vote on the proposal in a process that can take up to two years before it's rolled out on different platforms. In a statement Tinder said: \"As the largest and most diverse platform for meeting new people, we are uniquely positioned and incredibly proud to petition for this update. \"Inclusivity is a core value at Tinder, and we believe in fighting for what our users believe in.\" Recent petitions to expand the emoji catalogue have resulted in water pistols replacing guns, adding same sex couples to the emoji keyboard as well as more recently a redhead emoji. As it stands, the emoji keyboard already shows a range of family set-ups - including single parent families and same-sex parent families. Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

        "content": "Trevor Baylis believed that the key to success was to think unconventional thoughts. It was this mindset that saw him develop his clockwork radio after hearing about the problems of educating African people about HIV and Aids. It enabled those in remote areas without electricity, or access to batteries, to get the information that could save their lives. But despite the success of this, and other inventions, Baylis never made a great deal of money from his many ideas. Trevor Graham Baylis was born in Kilburn, north-west London, on 13 May 1937 and brought up in Southall, Middlesex. His father was an engineer and the young Trevor was introduced to a Meccano building set which inspired his fascination with mechanical things. The young Baylis supplemented the family income by working on a local milk round which saw him getting up at 3am each morning. He was also a proficient swimmer and narrowly failed to qualify for the 1956 British Olympic team, something he greatly regretted. He left school at 15 to work in a local soil mechanics laboratory, attending day-release courses in mechanical and structural engineering. Baylis did his National Service as a physical training instructor in the Army. When he left, he got a job as a salesman with Purley Pools, one of the first companies to sell free-standing swimming pools. Recycled\nBecause he was a good swimmer he demonstrated the pools at shows, attracting crowds of potential customers. He went on to form an aquatic stunt troupe which saw him diving into a glass-sided tank and also performing an underwater act in a Berlin circus. \"It was fantastic,\" he later recalled. \"I made enough money to buy a plot of land and and build the house of my dreams The death of a close friend in a trapeze accident prompted him to begin developing products for people with disabilities. \"Her death broke my heart,\" he said. \"You realise disability is only a banana skin away.\" He developed a range of products under the Orange Aids label, including one-handed scissors and devices for opening bottles and cans. But although the products were successful they failed to make his fortune. The costs of getting a patent were prohibitive and companies were able to copy his inventions. Aids\n\"I went into the deal which I thought would secure the future of Orange Aids with culpable impetuosity. I had been used to doing business on a handshake and my word of honour, and I made the error of actually believing what the men in the pinstriped suits told me.\" It was to be something that dogged his career but he remained philosophical, saying he always followed his heart. \"It's not about the money,\" he said in a 2004 interview. \"I can't imagine anything worse than looking at a computer all day then glancing at your watch because there is an important meeting about the men's toilets at 3pm.\" The idea for his wind-up radio came while he was watching a TV programme in 1991 about the spread of Aids in Africa and a proposal to tackle it by broadcasting educational programmes on the radio. Baylis later said he went into a reverie imagining himself as a colonial settler, nursing a gin and tonic and listening to a wind-up gramophone. The image encouraged him to go to his workshop, which was filled with disassembled domestic appliances and, within half an hour, he had a working prototype of his clockwork radio. Learning from his Orange Aids experience, Baylis patented the project and went in search of a manufacturer. Everyone he approached turned him down. Failed\nIt was an appearance on the BBC's Tomorrow's World programme in 1994 that finally brought his invention to public attention. \"Everyone thought I was a genius whereas, up to then, I was just another silly little man.\" Further publicity followed. He was awarded the BBC Design Award for Best Product and Best Design in 1996 and met Nelson Mandela and the Queen. A South African company began manufacturing his radio in 1997 but, once again, Baylis failed to make a great deal of money from the product. \"My mistake was that I trusted the people I was working alongside. Large corporations can circumnavigate your patents.\" He eventually lost control of his design and the company, somewhat ironically, began making cheaper wind-up radios for a Western market increasingly concerned with green issues. Undaunted, Baylis continued coming up with new ideas including a shoe that could generate electricity as the wearer walked. Disarray\nHe demonstrated them with a 100-mile hike across Namibia to raise money for a landmine charity. He also set up the Trevor Baylis Foundation to encourage and develop new products and, importantly, advise inventors how to protect their intellectual property. He was awarded an OBE in 1997 and collected a number of honorary degrees from leading universities. Trevor Baylis never married, believing that no wife would put up with the disarray in which he liked to work. He strongly believed that Britain was cavalier in its treatment of inventors, meaning many products disappeared overseas. \"Inventors do not get enough credit,\" he said. \"I always say, art is pleasure, invention is treasure. \"Nobody seems to know who invented the paper clip but everybody has one.\" ",

In early December a phrase which roughly translates as \"Grilled Lamb Delivery\" was a top trending phrase on Twitter in Saudi Arabia. Nearly 17,000 tweets mentioned the phrase - most of them promoting just one restaurant, and listing its phone number. As it turned out, thousands of \"people\" weren't in fact talking about one establishment's meat products, as succulent, juicy or overcooked as they might have been. In fact, the \"Grilled Lamb Delivery\" hashtag was a clandestine advertising campaign being pushed - successfully - by a network of automated bot accounts. The lamb trend is one of many artificially manufactured hashtags which regularly hit Twitter's list of \"Trending Topics\" in Saudi Arabia. They're promoted by shadowy companies that make money by gaming the social network's algorithm in an attempt to make conversations seem organic and natural - when they are anything but. You might also be interested in\n\"Trending Topics\"\nAt its most basic, Twitter's \"Trending Topics\" list is a real-time gauge of what people are talking about on the network. If you're looking at Twitter on a desktop, the list usually runs in a prominent position along the side of the page (circled below in red): On the Twitter mobile phone app, the list is one of the first things you see if you touch the magnifying glass icon. There's a worldwide list of Trending Topics, but also separate local lists detailing what's going big in individual countries and cities. Users can easily change their settings and look at lists from around the world. What goes on the Trending Topics lists is governed by an algorithm that measures not only sheer popularity (i.e. the total number of tweets), but velocity - in other words, how fast certain topics are surging on the network. It's why, for instance, names associated with breaking news and popular news site headlines often crack the list very quickly. Companies can pay Twitter to appear on the list. But these \"Promoted Trends\" are clearly marked as advertising. That's not the case for the artificially trending hashtags BBC Trending found. Congratulations Fahima!\nOur investigation discovered that companies in Saudi Arabia are promising to make hashtags hit the Trending Topics list for relatively small sums - and in many cases they are succeeding. To boost the popularity of otherwise mundane phrases and hashtags, these companies are using networks of bots - automated accounts which are programmed to shoot out a stream of messages at a particular time. Trending approached several companies which claimed to be able to make hashtags trend. Eventually we managed to contact the company behind the \"Grilled Lamb\" hashtag campaign. After a series of negotiations via WhatsApp, we were charged $200 (just under \u00a3150) to get the Arabic equivalent of \"Congratulations Fahima\" onto Saudi Arabia's Trending Topics list. The person behind the company promised that he could get the hashtag trending throughout the Gulf country. One attempt was aborted when the company representative said that high Twitter traffic due to a celebrity wedding meant he could not make the hashtag trend on our first chosen date. He was more successful several days later. The hashtag hit the list of top trends in the Saudi city of Jeddah, reaching as high as the sixth slot on the list. The botnet used by the company pumped out more than 600 messages including the \"Congratulations Fahima\" hashtag. But once it hit the list of Twitter Trends, real people began to use it. Some asked who Fahima was or claimed to be her friend. \"I know Fahima!\" tweeted one. \"She just had quadruplets!\" Bot limitations\nThere were definite limitations to the power of the company's botnet. The hashtag did not make it onto the general list of trends in Saudi Arabia - although other hashtags, like the \"Grilled Lamb\" one, did trend nationwide. And claims by the company and other similar firms that they could get hashtags trending in the UK and other Western countries appear to be highly exaggerated. But the ability to force something onto the trending list is impressive in a country where Twitter is hugely popular. According to a survey in 2014, Saudi Arabia had 2.4 million Twitter users - more than 40% of all active users of the social network in the Arab region. Trending tried to call the number associated with the WhatsApp account which handled the transaction, but the man who answered denied knowing anything about the company's business. Political potential\nHashtags which appear to be advertising in disguise regularly trend in Saudi Arabia. And although the most obvious ones are commercial in nature, there is potential for political manipulation as well, according to Marc Owen Jones, a lecturer of the history of the gulf and the Arabian Peninsula at Exeter University. \"I realised in the last Saudi-Qatar crisis that thousands of accounts were producing information that are either fake or propaganda,\" he says. \"What's interesting is having lots of these accounts is that they can manipulate what's seen by many audiences in the world, so the more accounts you have picking on a certain topic the more the topic gets pushed up to trend.\" \"Having those bots makes people believe that this is what people in the Gulf are talking about,\" he said.

The company said it is taking steps to stop manipulation but declined to give details about its actions, stating that \"saying more about those steps would only help bad actors.\" Reporting by Fahima Abdulrahman and Anisa Subedar Do you have a story for us?

        "content": "Large chunks of the planet are still of out of reach of mobile phone signals - billions are still without access to digital communications. But this could change thanks to shrinking satellite sizes and costs. Lower-cost, space-based mobile phone services will soon be a reality thanks to one firm's fleet of nano-satellites that will bounce your voice or text signal from one spacecraft to the next and finally down to the person you're calling. \"People were thinking of using nano-satellites for Earth imagery but nobody had thought of using them for voice or text communications,\" says Israeli former fighter pilot Meir Moalem, the chief executive of Sky and Space Global (SAS). \"We were the first.\" His firm is aiming to offer customers mobile phone connections via a constellation of 200 shoebox-sized satellites weighing just 10kg (22lb) each. The fleet is set to be operational by 2020 and will provide text, voice and data transfer services to the Earth's equatorial regions - including much of Latin America and Africa - to a market of up to three billion people. \"Affordable mobile services are critical for the economic and social development of many developing countries,\" says Mr Moalem, who believes SAS's nano-satellites will shake up the space-based communications market. \"Our total constellation costs just $150m (\u00a3108m). That's less than the cost of a single standard communications satellite. This is what we mean when we talk of a disruptive technology.\" But SAS is just one of a number of companies with big plans for space right now. Perhaps the most ambitious is Elon Musk's SpaceX, which is aiming to build a huge 4,400-satellite constellation offering global internet coverage. It will be using its own Falcon-9 rockets to launch its fleet and plans to have the network operating by 2024. And OneWeb has an 800-satellite constellation set for 2020, again focused on global broadband, while Google and Samsung are also mulling similar initiatives. With all these satellites, low-Earth orbit - an altitude of 2,000km (1,200 miles) or less above the planet - is becoming an increasingly crowded space. This could make future launches potentially difficult and dangerous with space debris. Then there is the issue of finance. Not every planned constellation is going to find the investors with deep enough pockets to back it, though David Fraser, research director at APP Securities, says SAS could be \"an attractive alternative option\" given its low capital costs. Vincent Chan, professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT, believes that satellite miniaturisation and cheaper launch vehicles mean that the \"nano-sat is ready to serve the public\". Such lower-cost infrastructure could bring much-needed mobile communications to the world's poorer regions, he says, helping to reduce the digital divide. But, he adds, SAS's focus on voice and text services rather than broadband internet, suggests that \"the digital divide will be narrower but not disappear\". For its part, SAS is using a non-traditional method of getting its satellites into orbit. They will be air-launched in batches of 24 by Virgin Orbit, part of Richard Branson's Virgin group. Virgin's modified Boeing 747-400 will fly up to 35,000ft (10,000m), then LauncherOne, a two-stage liquid oxygen-powered expendable rocket, will blast the payload into orbit. It's one of a number of air-launch-to-orbit systems under development. The advantage of launching from an aircraft is that the rocket can be launched in exactly the direction to suit the satellite's planned orbit. Virgin is planning its first launch later this year, while SAS's craft will be launched in 2019. Launch costs will typically be about $12m, much less than a traditional launch, says Virgin. It is \"all about helping the small satellite community get into orbit,\" says Dan Hart, Virgin Orbit's president and chief executive. Such lower-cost launch services will open up space to \"a whole host of communications [and] remote sensing applications,\" he says. SAS has already proved that its communications systems works with three pilot satellites, and is now signing deals with partners in Africa and Latin America - including one of the biggest satellite-communications providers in the Americas, Globalsat Group. Globalsat's chief executive, Alberto Palacios, says his firm's current customers - in the mining, energy, defence banking, and government sectors - can afford the costs of traditional satellite phone calls. But he believes nano-satellites are a game-changer. \"Some customers invest several hundreds of dollars in the hardware for a satellite phone terminal and will pay $50 a month for the service. But if you can offer a solution for half of that - then the price can be compared to conventional mobile phones,\" he explains. SAS says it is going for the gap in the market between existing satellite communications operators, such as Iridium, Inmarsat and Globalstar, and land-based mobile networks such as Vodafone, Telefonica, Airtel and Safaricom. It is targeting customers earning less than $8 a day. In Ghana, the company has just signed a five-year deal with telecoms provider Universal Cyberlinks to help government agricultural projects and public services, including monitoring cocoa production across 5,000 buying centres and checkpoints. \"When you travel outside of a city in Africa, often you lose your phone signal because it is not cost-effective to put up phone masts everywhere. That's where we come in,\" says Mr Moalem. \"In the West, we tend to forget that in many parts of the world people are not concerned about high-speed internet, they want to make simple phone calls, texting or money transfers. It's a basic need.\" Africa is certainly becoming a key market for mobile services. There were 420 million mobile subscribers in 2016 and by 2020 there will be more than 500 million, around half the population, says industry body GSMA. More Technology of Business\nFor his part, as you might expect of a former fighter pilot, Meir Moalem is optimistic about any rivals muscling in to the nano-sat communications niche. \"We welcome competition. It means we are a good business and there is money to be made,\" he says. \"There is room for other firms to do this, but we will have 'first mover' advantage.\" ",

        "content": "Sweden is one of the most innovative countries in the world, yet has a business culture that discourages bragging about its success. So is this humility a help or a hindrance when it comes to start-ups? From household names such as Spotify and Skype, to gaming leaders King and Mojang and cashless payment companies iZettle and Klarna, Sweden is a hotspot for industry-changing new technologies. Despite just 10 million inhabitants occupying a land mass largely defined by forest wilderness, the Nordic nation has in recent years created more billion dollar companies per capita than anywhere else outside Silicon Valley. Last month, Sweden was top in Europe in Bloomberg's global innovation ranking. The more familiar narrative for Sweden's start-up success story typically touches on several factors. It has a strong digital infrastructure, a highly educated, tech-savvy workforce, and an ideal population size for testing new innovations. And for those whose ideas don't take flight, there is a strong social welfare net to set them back on their feet. But since the death of Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad - and obituaries highlighting his humility and frugality - these firmly-embedded cultural traits have recaptured attention. Local and global observers are questioning their continuing role in shaping Sweden's thriving economy - including its disruptive tech scene. \"Trying to keep boasting to a minimum and finding a consensus so that everybody is on the same page\" remain two of the most pervasive practices in the Swedish workplace, says Lola Akinmade Akerstrom, a former programmer and now a cultural commentator, who highlighted this in her recent book Lagom: The Swedish Secret of Living Well. While the language in other innovation hubs might focus on individual rockstar CEOs \"killing it\"; in Swedish businesses \"it's about everybody getting together, making sure their voices are heard equally, so that they can all reach an optimal solution together,\" she says. At least part of this consensus-based culture has its roots in what Swedes call 'Jantelagen' (the Law of Jante) which draws its modern name from a town called Jante depicted in a 1933 novel by Danish-Norwegian author Aksel Sandemose. This describes a centuries-old tradition that discourages extravagant displays of wealth or success and deconstructs hierarchies. In other words, nobody should consider themselves better than anyone else. \"In the workplace, Jantelagen creates a more collaborative, as opposed to a more competitive, environment because it's trying to remove all the stress points of competition or feeling like you're better than each other,\" explains Mrs Akerstrom. About 400 miles north of the Swedish capital, the concept is being discussed over strong cups of coffee on the minimalist wooden benches and soft bean bags inside House Be, a co-working space and membership club for outdoor-loving tech workers in the mountainous town of Are. Despite a population of just 5,000, Are has the highest proportion of young entrepreneurs in the country, according to the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise (Svenskt Naringsliv), with many people drawn by opportunities to spend time on the slopes or out hiking, while also building a business. The hub was co-founded by Spotify's former international growth manager, Ulrika Viklund, who argues that the most positive aspect of Jantelagen in the start-up scene is that it encourages people to \"help each other out more\". \"We usually don't have this big boss that sits in a corner office and take all the decisions,\" she explains. \"At Spotify it wouldn't have been possible to succeed without this working culture where all the competences in the company are utilised because everyone is allowed to be innovative and say what they believe is the right thing to do.\" Johan Formgren, a tech entrepreneur previously based in Berlin, adds that Sweden's penchant for flat structures and modesty also helps to create strong networks. \"In Stockholm I was part of a network called SUP46 that gave us a lot of access to the biggest, greatest Swedish tech companies. The founder of Skype was there maybe once a month, and was accessible and wanted to talk to all us young tech start-up people.\" Currently building his fifth business - a digital human resources tool - from Are's snowy mountains, Mr Formgren has already raised \"close to half a million dollars\" in investment for his latest venture. Yet it's worth noting that these are details he only discloses after 30 minutes of conversation. And it is this aspect of Jantelagen - avoiding bragging - that many argue is detrimental to Sweden's tech scene. \"It has made it more difficult to have role models,\" argues Ulrika Wiklund. \"The people that succeed, they don't dare to drive a luxury car, they don't dare to show when they have done something good. Maybe that has made it more difficult to inspire entrepreneurs.\" Swedish start-ups attracted \u20ac1.3bn ($1.6bn: \u00a31.1bn) in 2017, according to figures from European venture capital database Dealroom.co - compared to \u20ac2.9bn in Germany and \u20ac7.1bn in the UK. While the statistics are impressive given Sweden's size, does Jantelagen hold back companies from aiming higher? \"Research suggests you receive capital depending how confident and boastful you are about your idea,\" says Sofia Wingren, chief executive of Hyper Island, a business school in Stockholm with a focus on equipping students for careers in the digital sector. She argues that Swedes have typically been too susceptible to \"working in the quiet\" to \"perfect\" products, before seeking funding or launching them on to the market. More Technology of Business\nWhile Hyper Island's current crop of millennial students is less bashful and more globally-minded than previous generations, a core part of the school's teaching is focussed on trying to address this issue. \"We have a lot of performances or stage presentations where we coach and guide students on how... to present themselves and how to be confident,\" Ms Wingren says. External factors will clearly also play a role in Sweden maintaining its reputation as a leading innovation hub. An acute housing crisis, taxes on stock options and strict migration regulations are fuelling national debates about the country's ability to attract the global skills needed to help companies in the small Nordic nation to realise their ideas. Meanwhile, observers point to the challenge of maintaining the emphasis on trust and consensus that characterises Swedish business practices, in the face of growing global competition from other innovation hubs and rapid digitalisation. \"The world is moving so fast that we may not have time to get everybody's opinion,\" argues Lola Akinmade Akerstrom. \"Sweden has to find the sweet spot. It's about taking the best parts of that consensus mindset and a culture steeped in organisation, and being open to creativity and flexibility and diverse points of views and ways of working.\" ",

        "content": "Fish farming is big business - the industry now produces about 100 million tonnes a year - and with salmon prices soaring, producers are turning to lasers, automation and artificial intelligence to boost production and cut costs. How do you know if farmed salmon have had enough to eat? Well, according to Lingalaks fish farms in Norway, which produce nearly three million salmon each year, the fish make less noise once the feeding frenzy is over. The firm knows this thanks to a new hydro-acoustic system it has installed at one of its farms. The system listens to the salmon sloshing loudly about as they feed in a cluster. When the fish have had enough, they swim off and the noise lessens. Lingalaks chief executive Erlend Haugarvoll hopes this knowledge will save his firm lots of money in reduced feed, as much of it currently gets wasted. \"I think it could improve [expenditure] by about 5%,\" he says. \"That could be between 7m-10m krone (\u00a3630,000-\u00a3900,000; $900,000-$1.3m) for our firm.\" The system, developed by tech firm CageEye, has taken years to develop, says chief executive Bendik Sovegjarto. \"It's not like a pellet detector,\" Mr Sovegjarto says, which observes the number of fish food pellets left in the water. \"When you don't see any pellets, you can't be certain if it's because the fish are full or that you're looking in the wrong place because of the water currents.\" Using audio data from the caged salmon is more accurate and could save Norwegian fish farms 1bn krone a year in un-gobbled feed, believes Mr Sovegjarto. The technology has been developed with the help of Ole Folkedal, at the Institute of Marine Research, in Bergen. He has monitored salmon feeding patterns and other data, such as water temperature and oxygen levels, and this is giving scientists and farmers new insights into the factors influencing how much the fish want to eat. \"You have huge variations in how much to feed every day,\" says Mr Folkedal. He adds that the data can be used to operate completely automated feeding systems, with humans simply overseeing the process. The rise of artificial intelligence technologies like these, which make decisions about when feeding should stop and start, is set to make big changes to the lucrative industry of salmon farming. There are other hi-tech approaches to automated fish monitoring, too. For example, one start-up, Aquabyte, recently raised $3.5m (\u00a32.5m) for a system that makes better use of existing video surveillance data. Many modern fish farms already use video cameras to monitor the salmon in their cages, says Aquabyte founder and chief executive Bryton Shang. \"They stick CCTV in the pens and have operators off site watching the fish and determining how much to feed,\" he explains. \"We take the images from the CCTV and use computer vision algorithms [instead].\" With this approach, computers carefully monitor the group of feeding fish visually. The system is also designed to look out for a perennially problematic visitor to fish farms - the parasitic sea louse. Lice attach to salmon and eat them, causing damage that can be fatal. The lice can also make the fish inedible for humans. Mr Shang hopes his technology will help farmers detect sea lice so that they can then be removed manually. But even lice removal could be automated in the future. Stingray has come up with a self-guided tool that fires lasers at the lice to destroy them. \"The louse is hit with a fatal result, and coagulates within milliseconds,\" boasts the company's website. Meanwhile the de-loused salmon, thanks to its mirror-like skin that reflects the laser, swims off unharmed. It's perhaps no surprise that salmon farmers are turning to hi-tech solutions - the industry is certainly a wealthy one. Fish farms are worth nearly 50bn krone (\u00a34.6bn; $6.4bn) to the Norwegian economy, and this year the country is expected to see growth of 9% in farmed salmon production. Norwegian fish company Salmar's gigantic offshore installation, Ocean Farm 1, is a 110m-wide (120 yards) cage capable of containing 1.5 million fish. London-based Hemang Rishi, co-founder of Observe Technologies, says his firm is developing technology that can visually monitor feeding in salmon cages. \"We are just deploying our first product on site for an extended period of time in Chile, where they have the second largest salmon market in the world after Norway,\" he says. And in Florida, a firm called Atlantic Sapphire is hoping to construct a giant salmon farm - on land. The concept involves water swirled mechanically in large tanks to give fish the illusion that they are still at sea. It's not hard to imagine highly automated fish farms of the future, in which humans have very little to do. More Technology of Business\n\"My prediction is that autonomous systems will do most of the jobs in future years,\" says Mr Folkedal. However, he notes that current regulations in Norway mean that, for now at least, farmed fish must be manually checked regularly for signs of illness and mortalities. But many of the tasks farmers must perform daily - such as counting and measuring fish - are tedious, and could be automated once machines become accurate enough, Mr Folkedal believes. \"That's something that the farmers really want,\" he says.

        "content": "Donald Trump has reacted cautiously to news that North Korea is willing to talk about giving up its nuclear weapons if it did not feel threatened. The US president said \"the statements coming out of South Korea and North Korea have been very positive\", but also said it might be a \"false hope\". South Korea earlier said the subject was raised when its officials met the North's leader, Kim Jong-un, on Monday. Seoul said Mr Kim was also open to US talks, and would pause weapons testing. In previous programmes to halt its nuclear ambitions, the North has failed to keep its promises. The leaders of North and South Korea have also agreed to meet at a summit next month, Seoul's envoy says. It will be the first such meeting for more than a decade and the first since Kim Jong-un took power in North Korea. Throughout February's Winter Olympics in South Korea, the two countries struck a friendly tone, sending athletes to compete in a joint team and holding talks. What did President Trump say?\nSpeaking to reporters at Washington's Oval Office, he said: \"We have come certainly a long way, at least rhetorically, with North Korea. \"The statements coming out of South Korea and North Korea have been very positive. That would be a great thing for the world.\" The US leader also praised Pyongyang for its decision to take part in the Pyeongchang Olympics. But he earlier posted a cautious tweet, warning about a \"false hope\". Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction! End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump Meanwhile, US Vice-President Mike Pence said: \"Whichever direction talks with North Korea go, we will be firm in our resolve. \"The United States and our allies remain committed to applying maximum pressure on the Kim regime to end their nuclear program. \"All options are on the table and our posture toward the regime will not change until we see credible, verifiable, and concrete steps toward denuclearisation.\" Lt Gen Robert Ashley, who heads the US Defense Intelligence Agency, said he did not share optimism voiced in America, adding that \"we'll see how this plays out\". The US has maintained that North Korean gestures of rapprochement would carry little weight without a commitment on nuclear weapons - particularly following last year's nuclear and missile tests carried out by the North. The South Korean delegation is expected to visit Washington later this week to brief US officials on their talks in the North. Meanwhile, China's foreign ministry said it hoped the Koreas could continue with efforts to advance reconciliation, Reuters news agency reported. What is North Korea reported to have said?\nA statement from the South Korea president's office issued earlier on Tuesday said: \"The North showed willingness on denuclearisation in the Korean Peninsula. If military threats to the North Korea decrease and regime safety is guaranteed, the North showed that it has no reason to retain nukes.\" The North's KCNA news agency said Mr Kim had \"warmly welcomed\" the delegates and held an \"openhearted talk\" with them. It said the dinner took place \"in a warm atmosphere overflowing with compatriotic feelings\". However, some critics have suspicions over North Korea's intentions. In the past, they have failed to follow through on deals, notably an aid-for-disarmament agreement in 2005. What happened at the Pyongyang dinner?\nSouth Korean officials had a four-hour dinner with Kim Jong-un on Monday. Among the delegation were intelligence chief Suh Hoon and National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong. Pictures showed Mr Kim and visitors from the South smiling broadly around a dinner table. Also present was Mr Kim's wife, Ri Sol-ju, who rarely appears at official events, and his sister Kim Yo-jong, who was part of a North Korean delegation to the Pyeongchang Olympics. The two sides appear to be aiming to capitalise on the reduced tensions after the Games, which saw the Koreas march together under one flag. During their visit, the South's officials also held a boardroom meeting and passed on a letter from South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in which he invited Mr Kim to attend further talks. KCNA said Mr Kim had \"exchanged views and made a satisfactory agreement\" on the letter and gave orders for it to be acted on. The South's delegates returned to Seoul on Tuesday morning, the South Korean news agency Yonhap said. Has this ever happened before?\nThese were the first officials from Seoul to meet Mr Kim since he came to power. Kim Jong-un has met very few foreign officials since he became leader in 2011 and the last time envoys from the South visited Pyongyang was in 2007. Two previous summits were held in 2000 and 2007, under South Korean presidents Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun who met Kim's father, Kim Jong-il. The South's officials have stressed the talks were only preliminary, but the parties had \"somewhat shared\" views on some issues. ",

        "content": "Donald Trump has reacted cautiously to news that North Korea is willing to talk about giving up its nuclear weapons if it did not feel threatened. The US president said \"the statements coming out of South Korea and North Korea have been very positive\", but also said it might be a \"false hope\". South Korea earlier said the subject was raised when its officials met the North's leader, Kim Jong-un, on Monday. Seoul said Mr Kim was also open to US talks, and would pause weapons testing. In previous programmes to halt its nuclear ambitions, the North has failed to keep its promises. The leaders of North and South Korea have also agreed to meet at a summit next month, Seoul's envoy says. It will be the first such meeting for more than a decade and the first since Kim Jong-un took power in North Korea. Throughout February's Winter Olympics in South Korea, the two countries struck a friendly tone, sending athletes to compete in a joint team and holding talks. What did President Trump say?\nSpeaking to reporters at Washington's Oval Office, he said: \"We have come certainly a long way, at least rhetorically, with North Korea. \"The statements coming out of South Korea and North Korea have been very positive. That would be a great thing for the world.\" The US leader also praised Pyongyang for its decision to take part in the Pyeongchang Olympics. But he earlier posted a cautious tweet, warning about a \"false hope\". Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction! End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump Meanwhile, US Vice-President Mike Pence said: \"Whichever direction talks with North Korea go, we will be firm in our resolve. \"The United States and our allies remain committed to applying maximum pressure on the Kim regime to end their nuclear program. \"All options are on the table and our posture toward the regime will not change until we see credible, verifiable, and concrete steps toward denuclearisation.\" Lt Gen Robert Ashley, who heads the US Defense Intelligence Agency, said he did not share optimism voiced in America, adding that \"we'll see how this plays out\". The US has maintained that North Korean gestures of rapprochement would carry little weight without a commitment on nuclear weapons - particularly following last year's nuclear and missile tests carried out by the North. The South Korean delegation is expected to visit Washington later this week to brief US officials on their talks in the North. Meanwhile, China's foreign ministry said it hoped the Koreas could continue with efforts to advance reconciliation, Reuters news agency reported. What is North Korea reported to have said?\nA statement from the South Korea president's office issued earlier on Tuesday said: \"The North showed willingness on denuclearisation in the Korean Peninsula. If military threats to the North Korea decrease and regime safety is guaranteed, the North showed that it has no reason to retain nukes.\" The North's KCNA news agency said Mr Kim had \"warmly welcomed\" the delegates and held an \"openhearted talk\" with them. It said the dinner took place \"in a warm atmosphere overflowing with compatriotic feelings\". However, some critics have suspicions over North Korea's intentions. In the past, they have failed to follow through on deals, notably an aid-for-disarmament agreement in 2005. What happened at the Pyongyang dinner?\nSouth Korean officials had a four-hour dinner with Kim Jong-un on Monday. Among the delegation were intelligence chief Suh Hoon and National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong. Pictures showed Mr Kim and visitors from the South smiling broadly around a dinner table. Also present was Mr Kim's wife, Ri Sol-ju, who rarely appears at official events, and his sister Kim Yo-jong, who was part of a North Korean delegation to the Pyeongchang Olympics. The two sides appear to be aiming to capitalise on the reduced tensions after the Games, which saw the Koreas march together under one flag. During their visit, the South's officials also held a boardroom meeting and passed on a letter from South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in which he invited Mr Kim to attend further talks. KCNA said Mr Kim had \"exchanged views and made a satisfactory agreement\" on the letter and gave orders for it to be acted on. The South's delegates returned to Seoul on Tuesday morning, the South Korean news agency Yonhap said. Has this ever happened before?\nThese were the first officials from Seoul to meet Mr Kim since he came to power. Kim Jong-un has met very few foreign officials since he became leader in 2011 and the last time envoys from the South visited Pyongyang was in 2007. Two previous summits were held in 2000 and 2007, under South Korean presidents Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun who met Kim's father, Kim Jong-il. The South's officials have stressed the talks were only preliminary, but the parties had \"somewhat shared\" views on some issues. ",

        "content": "The loss of trees across Europe is pushing beetles to the brink of extinction, according to a new report. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature assessed the status of 700 European beetles that live in old and hollowed wood. Almost a fifth (18%) are at risk of extinction due to the decline of ancient trees, the European Red List of Saproxylic Beetles report found. This puts them among the most threatened insect groups in Europe. Saproxylic beetles play a role in natural processes, such as decomposition and the recycling of nutrients. They also provide an important food source for birds and mammals and some are involved in pollination. \"Some beetle species require old trees that need hundreds of years to grow, so conservation efforts need to focus on long-term strategies to protect old trees across different landscapes in Europe, to ensure that the vital ecosystem services provided by these beetles continue,\" said Jane Smart, director of the IUCN Global Species Programme. Logging, tree loss and wood harvesting all contribute to the loss of habitat for the beetles, said the IUCN. Other major threats include urbanisation and tourism development, and an increase in wildfires in the Mediterranean region. Conservation efforts need to focus on long-term strategies to protect old trees and deadwood across forests, pastureland, orchards and urban areas, the report recommended. It said there should be inventories of ancient and veteran trees for each European country, to ensure these trees are protected in all landscapes. \"It is critical for the Common Agricultural Policy to promote the appropriate management of wood pasture habitats containing veteran trees across Europe,\" said Luc Bas, director of the IUCN European Regional Office. Monitoring\nThe report pointed to the need for different ages of trees in the landscape, including saplings, mature trees, ancient trees, standing dead trees, fallen tree trunks and stumps. It said some progress had been made in the forestry sector, while the importance of deadwood is being increasingly acknowledged in many countries. In Europe, there are 58 families of beetles, made up of nearly 29,000 species. About 4,000 are thought to rely on dead and decaying wood for at least part of their lifecycle. However, for many of these species data is lacking, suggesting more monitoring is urgently needed. \"The population trend of half the species assessed remains unknown,\" said Keith Alexander, IUCN Saproxylic Beetles Specialist Advisor. He said that three of the species from the list were found in the UK, including a type of longhorn beetle that lives only on veteran oak trees. He called for raised public awareness of their conservation needs. \"Some of these beetles are incredibly beautiful interesting things - if people stopped and looked at them and appreciated them, they'd realise they're just as worthy of conservation as elephants and tigers,\" he told the BBC. \"And these things live in the countryside on our doorstep.\" Beetles at risk:\nFollow Helen on Twitter.

        "content": "Scientists have unveiled one of the smallest bird fossils ever discovered. The chick lived 127 million years ago and belonged to a group of primitive birds that shared the planet with the dinosaurs. Fossils of birds from this time period are rare, with baby fossils seen as \"the rarest of the rare\". Scientists say the discovery gives a peek into the lives of the ancient, long-extinct birds that lived between 250 and 66 million years ago. The bird belonged to the enantiornithine family, most of which had teeth and clawed fingers on each wing, but otherwise looked much like modern birds. \"It's amazing to realise that many of the features we see among living birds had already been developed more than 100 million years ago,\" said Luis Chiappe, from the LA Museum of Natural History. Minute matter\nFrom nose to tail the hatchling was a bit shorter than the little finger of a human hand, and it weighed just 10 grams. The bird died not long after leaving the egg, giving a window into a critical stage of development. Researchers from the UK, Spain, Sweden and the US used state-of-the-art technology to study its fossilised bones. Analysis in a synchrotron - particle accelerators that use very intense light to study minute matter - revealed that the chick probably could not not fly at this stage. The cartilage in its sternum (breast bone in the centre of the chest) had not yet fully turned to bone. Lead researcher Fabien Knoll of ARAID-Dinopolis and the University of Manchester said analysis of bone development can be used to study a host of evolutionary characteristics. \"New technologies are offering palaeontologists unprecedented capacities to investigate fossils,\" he said. The fossil was found many years ago in the famous Las Hoyas site in Spain. However, it has remained largely unstudied until now. \"Truth be told, the techniques we used to analyse it in the paper (such as synchrotron microtomography and elemental mapping) had not yet been developed when the specimen was discovered,\" said Dr Knoll. Studying the process of bone development can explain a lot about a young bird's life and development. These early bird chicks may have been much like modern chickens, which have feathers and can move around from birth. Or they might have been more similar to living love birds, which hatch with no feathers and their eyes shut, meaning they need parental care. The research, published in the journal, Nature Communications, suggests the enantiornithines were very diverse in their behaviour and development. Follow Helen on Twitter. ",

        "content": "Scientists have stumbled across a huge group of previously unknown Ad\u00e9lie penguins on the most northerly point of the Antarctic Peninsula. Numbering more than 1.5 million birds, they were first noticed when great patches of their poo, or guano, showed up in pictures taken from space. The animals are crammed on to a rocky archipelago called the Danger Islands. The researchers, who detail the discovery in the journal Scientific Reports, say it is a total surprise. \"It's a classic case of finding something where no-one really looked! The Danger Islands are hard to reach, so people didn't really try that hard,\" team-member Dr Tom Hart from Oxford University, UK, told BBC News. The scientists used an algorithm to search images from the American Landsat spacecraft for sites of possible penguin activity. Landsat does not return especially high-resolution pictures and so when the system flagged potential colonies, they had to be followed up with much sharper pictures for confirmation. \"And the sheer size of what we were looking at took our breath away,\" said Dr Heather Lynch from Stony Brook University, New York. \"We thought, 'Wow! If what we're seeing is true, these are going to be some of the largest Ad\u00e9lie penguin colonies in the world, and it's going to be well worth our while sending in an expedition to count them properly.\" You may also be interested in:\nBut, as the name implies, the Danger Islands are notoriously difficult to reach. Even in the austral summer, the ocean surrounding the archipelago is filled with the kind of thick sea-ice that ships try to avoid. However, in December 2015, the team did manage to get on the ground to begin its count. And one of the most effective techniques was to deploy drones, which flew above the birds to make large mosaics of their nesting sites. \"The drone lets you fly in a grid over the island, taking pictures once per second. You can then stitch them together into a huge collage that shows the entire landmass in 2D and 3D,\" explained Prof Hanumant Singh from Northeastern University. Once again, trained software was called upon to do the actual counting. The survey revealed that the Danger Islands host in total 751,527 pairs of Ad\u00e9lie penguins, including the third and fourth largest colonies in the world. The result is of major significance because it would appear the archipelago has somehow avoided the recent Ad\u00e9lie declines documented elsewhere on the peninsula, particularly on its western side. Scientists suspect that decline has something to do with reductions in sea-ice, which is an important habitat for krill, the small crustaceans that form a key part of the penguin diet. Dr Hart commented: \"On the West Antarctic Peninsula, Adelie and chinstrap penguins are declining pretty fast, while Gentoo penguins are increasing. \"It's hard to know the causes. Clearly climate change and reduction in ice and krill play a part, but a decline in sea-ice also allows in shipping - fisheries in particular - which may exacerbate the problem. \"In the past we've looked at this on the West Antarctic Peninsula versus places like Elephant Island (further to the north). Finally getting into the Danger Islands and counting the penguins shows how robust populations are where the ice is intact.\" And Dr Lynch added: \"The other point worth making is that these islands are right in the mix for a couple of marine protected areas that are being proposed. \"Whether they'll be in or out, we don't know but at least now the people making those decisions will understand how important this area is,\" she told BBC News. Dr Peter Fretwell from the British Antarctic Survey knows the team but was not involved in this study. He also uses satellites to identify and count animal groups. \"Despite our modern technologically advanced world there are still remote corners that we know very little about - usually because they are extremely difficult to get to,\" he said. \"Modern satellites are fantastic tools for exploring and studying these hard-to-access places. I am sure that there are many other natural discoveries to be made using these 'eyes in the sky'.\" Follow Jonathan and Vic on Twitter ",

        "content": "Police in Honduras have arrested an energy company executive on suspicion of masterminding the murder of a renowned environmental activist. Berta Caceres was shot dead inside her home exactly two years ago, on the night of 2 March 2016. She had led protests against a dam project. The arrested man, Roberto David Castillo, is executive president of Desa, the firm that was building the dam. Desa has insisted he is innocent. The company blamed \"international pressure and smear campaigns of various NGOs [non-governmental organisations]\" for the development. Mr Castillo is reportedly a former military intelligence officer. Eight other people have already been tried over the killing, including members of the armed forces and other Desa staff. Ms Caceres' family have long maintained she was murdered for economic reasons. They say she suffered months of threats from police, politicians and construction companies. In November 2017, a 92-page report by international experts concluded that energy company executives and state agents had conspired to kill the activist. The murder raised outrage internationally, with Oscar-winner Leonardo DiCaprio tweeting that Ms Caceres' work should be honoured. She is remembered for peacefully defending the rights of Honduran indigenous communities and in 2015 won the Goldman Prize, one of the most prestigious awards for environmentalism. The judges said she had \"rallied the indigenous Lenca people of Honduras and waged a grassroots campaign that successfully pressured the world's largest dam builder to pull out of the Agua Zarca Dam\". The dam would have flooded large areas of land and cut off the supply of water, food and medicine for hundreds of Lenca people. News of Mr Castillo's arrest broke amid protests demanding justice for Ms Caceres, who was a mother of four. She is one of over 100 land activists murdered in Honduras in the last decade. ",

        "content": "The packaging industry in England has been accused of exaggerating the amount of its plastic that gets recycled. Waste consultancy Eunomia estimates official figures over-state the quantity of plastic packaging sent for recycling by about a third. Much of what does go into the waste stream may be of such poor quality it cannot be re-used, its report said. An industry spokesman said he was \"very confident\" of the accuracy of the data from packaging firms. But Eunomia argues that the industry's figures simply do not tally with the amount of plastic actually in the waste stream. And it says packaging firms contribute a small fraction of the \u00a32.8bn burden on local authorities of dealing with waste. So who does the calculations? And who is making sure that companies get it right? Well, packaging firms have to take part in government-approved schemes under what is known as \"producer responsibility\". This obliges them to purchase a credit - a Packaging Recovery Note (PRN) - from a recycling firm to contribute to improving recycling. Defra says the scheme raised \u00a350m in 2016. The cash was to be used for \"capacity building\" in the recycling system through increasing collection and processing of recyclables. But critics say the scheme is so opaque it is hard to tell exactly how the money is spent. Local councils, which have to run waste collection and litter services, complain they do not see a penny of it. The row goes to the heart of the government's current review of plastics and waste. Green campaigners want ministers to adopt the sort of deposit and return schemes on drinks containers that are seen across northern Europe. This system is transparent because every container going on to the market has to be registered for the deposit. So the tally of recycled bottles and cans is based on real numbers, not estimates. The packaging industry is urging ministers to stick with the current PRN scheme, which it says is cheaper. It is offering to make the system more transparent and to increase the amount raised for improving recycling. The Environment Secretary Michael Gove is expected to make a decision on the issue after Easter. Official statistics say that in 2016 the UK produced 2.26 million tonnes of plastic packaging waste, and recycled almost 44.9% of it. But Eunomia's Dominic Hogg countered: \"No-one believes these figures.\" He said when packaging was placed on the market it is clean, dry and free from extra materials such as labels. But when the quantity of plastic collected for recycling is measured, the weight is inflated by moisture, contaminants and labels. Another problem may be that volumes of plastic packaging placed on the market are based on estimates provided by the packaging industry itself. These firms, Eunomia claims, have little incentive to ensure accurate data because the more plastic they put on the market, the bigger their recycling bill through the PRN system. EU comparison\nThe PRN operation is run by a group of compliance firms. The main operator is Valpak. Its spokesman, Adrian Hawkes, told BBC News there was no evidence of producers deliberately under-reporting their plastic production. He said robust systems were in place to develop reasonable estimates of the total packaging placed on the market. \"We are confident in our information because it is based on very detailed and comprehensive data representing over 50% of UK packaged goods sales,\" he told BBC News. \"We use the UK's largest and most comprehensive database of packaging weights covering hundreds of thousands of different products to calculate the total tonnage of packaging put on the market.\" But he did concede the report raised challenges over packaging associated with on-line purchases across borders - and the fact that some smaller businesses do not currently have to make a report. He said their calculations were audited by the Environment Agency - and pointed out that providing false data is an offence. Dr Hogg maintained that the audit system was not tight enough, adding: \"The system of producer responsibility is failing. It has allowed problems with plastic packaging to grow.\" He said reform of the producer responsibility system must form part of a more radical overhaul of waste policy. And added that the PRN scheme was run at the lowest cost for business - not the lowest cost for society, because taxpayers have to foot the bill for collecting and disposing of waste. \"There should be a deposit refund scheme for beverage containers,\" he said. \"And producers of other packaging should be charged fees that really reflect how much recycled material it contains, and how well it is recycled.\" Local councils support a change in the system. The Local Government Association's spokesman, Cllr Martin Tett, told BBC News: \"Councils support reforms that see producers take greater responsibility around the creation and disposal of waste - including making a contribution towards local authority costs. \"The UK raises the lowest level of contribution to costs from producers amongst all EU states.\" 'Kerbside success'\nValpak told BBC News: \"The producer responsibility system was deliberately designed by government and industry to meet required recycling targets at minimum cost. It was not intended to cover all the costs (of recycling).\" A spokesman said it estimated that producers contributed \u00a3100m a year towards recycling - that's between 25% and 30% of what they estimate is the total recycling bill. He said that Valpak had recently calculated that the situation is not so bad as it is portrayed. The current collection rate for plastic drinks containers in the UK is actually 74% - not the 57%, he said - thanks to kerbside collection systems. He added that government was considering changes to the PRN system which could involve an increased cost share by producers to fund specific activities. Samantha Harding from the Campaign to Protect Rural England told BBC News that packagers were \"dangling the carrot\" of more cash from an improved PRN system in order to avoid a deposit-return system. \"At the moment, 90% of costs fall on the taxpayer and this isn't right,\" she said.

        "content": "Scientists say they have observed a signature on the sky from the very first stars to shine in the Universe. They did it with the aid of a small radio telescope in the Australian outback that was tuned to detect the earliest ever evidence for hydrogen. This hydrogen was in a state that could only be explained if it had been touched by the intense light of stars. The team puts the time of this interaction at a mere 180 million years after the Big Bang. Given that the cosmos is roughly 13.8 billion years old, it means the first stars lit up a full nine billion years before even our own Sun flickered into life. Dr Judd Bowman of Arizona State University, US, is the lead author on the scholarly paper describing the observation in the journal Nature. He told BBC News that the discovery's great significance meant his group had to be absolutely sure no mistakes were made. \"We first started seeing signs in our data back in late 2015. And we've really spent the last couple of years trying to think of all sorts of possible alternative explanations, and then rule them out one by one,\" he said. \"This is the first time any team has been able to present evidence for the detection of this signal and hopefully it will go down as a milestone for this type of astrophysical observation.\" For decades, scientists have sought evidence for the very first population of stars. Theory says they would have grown out of the cold hydrogen gas that filled the Universe following the Big Bang. They were very probably unwieldy giants that burned brilliant but brief lives, before then exploding and seeding the Universe with all the chemical elements that make life possible. We cannot see these ancient behemoths directly with current technology, but we can, say astronomers, capture an indirect proof of their activity. Their ultraviolet light should have altered the great clouds of hydrogen surrounding them, exciting the gas into a state that made it absorb background radiation at a very specific radio frequency of 1.4 gigahertz. The challenge for the table top-sized telescope at the Murchison observatory in Western Australia was to try to pick out this signal in the sea of radio noise coming from the sky. Part of the issue was knowing where exactly to search on the spectrum, given that the expansion of the Universe over the eons would have stretched the signal to much lower frequencies. But the team eventually found it in the region of 78 megahertz. And knowing what we do about the rate of cosmic expansion, the shift in frequency gives an origin for the starlight-hydrogen interaction of 180 million years after the Big Bang. 'New window'\nOf significant interest is the strength of the signal which is well above expectation. This suggests, say commentators, that the hydrogen gas was a lot colder than previously supposed. One exciting explanation for this is if the hydrogen atoms in the early cosmos had some direct interaction with so-called \"dark matter\". This unseen \"stuff\" is postulated to exist because of the way its gravitational influence is seen to affect the rotation of galaxies. But its substance is unknown because no other type of interaction has yet been observed. The Murchison observation may be the first hint that such interactions are possible and the news therefore is likely to galvanise efforts to make the first detections of dark matter particles. Paolo de Bernardis is a professor of astrophysics at the University of Rome \"La Sapienza\", and was not connected with the research. He said the signal was extremely interesting. \"If confirmed, it's a breakthrough,\" he told BBC News. Quite why the signal was so strong, we would have to indulge our fantasies until follow-up experiments could probe it further, he added. \"But I find this measurement really exciting.\" Prof Brian Schmidt, who won the Nobel Prize for detecting an acceleration in the expansion of the Universe, described the discovery as potentially \"revolutionary\". And Prof Karl Glazebrook from Swinburne University of Technology, Australia, said astronomers worldwide would now be holding their breath until the result was confirmed by an independent experiment. \"If it is, then this will open the door to a new window on the early Universe and potentially a new understanding of the nature of dark matter,\" he explained.

        "content": "Scientists have had to abandon their plan to investigate the waters around the world's biggest iceberg. The team, led by the British Antarctic Survey, was thwarted in its attempts to reach the massive block known as A-68 by thick sea-ice in the Weddell Sea. The iceberg broke away from the Larsen C Ice Shelf on the eastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula last July. It revealed portions of the sea-floor that had been covered for many thousands of years. The team, which is on the Royal Research Ship James Clark Ross, had been hoping to sample what were likely to be new species. These animals would have had to adapt to an environment devoid of light to survive. \"We knew that getting through the sea-ice to reach Larsen C would be difficult,\" said expedition leader Dr Katrin Linse. \"Naturally, we are disappointed not to get there but safety must come first. \"The captain and crew have been fantastic and pulled out all the stops to get us to the ice shelf, but our progress became too slow, with just 8km travelled in 24 hours and we still had over 400km to travel. Mother Nature has not been kind to us on our mission. \"But we have a 'Plan B'; we will head north to areas which have never been sampled for benthic biodiversity. \"The Prince Gustav Channel Ice Shelf and neighbouring Larsen A Ice Shelf collapsed in 1995. We'll be sampling deeper than we planned at Larsen C - down to 1,000m - so we're excited about what deep sea creatures we might find.\" The expedition has gone later in the Antarctic season than it would have been ideal, but the urgent proposal to go sample A-68's waters had to fit with BAS schedules that had long been agreed for this season. Normally, it takes a few years to put such a venture together. There should, however, still be an opportunity to visit the berg next year as many on the current expedition will join a German effort run out of the Alfred Wegener Institute. It will use the Research Vessel Polarstern. In the meantime, the BAS Plan B goes into action. It will see the team collect seafloor animals, microbes, plankton, sediments and water samples in the vicinity of the alternative ice shelves.

        "content": "Water firms have been accused of exploiting their monopoly power and neglecting the environment. The critcism comes from Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who said some firms had paid no tax and hidden their earnings offshore. And he promised to back the regulator Ofwat in tightening up rules to protect bill-payers and the environment. The industry body Water UK responded that the companies were dealing firmly with issues that threatened trust. But Mr Gove\u2019s speech to a water industry conference must have made uncomfortable listening. He complained that water firms had paid out almost all of their \u00a318bn profits to shareholders, instead of re-investing it in mending leaks and protecting the environment. And he named names: The boss of United Utilities taking home \u00a32.8m a year; the head of Severn Trent, \u00a32.4m. The secretary of state said last year Anglian and Southern paid zero corporation tax, whilst Thames has paid no corporation tax for a decade. He suggested: \"Some of their best brains appear to be as intent on financial engineering as much as real engineering.\" Mr Gove promised to back recommendations from the regulator Ofwat due to be published in April \u2013 and said he would not hesitate to increase the pressure. He told the firms: \"You may be private companies, but you have a responsibility to the public who can\u2019t take their custom elsewhere.\" The politician complained that three billion litres of water still leak out every day - and said the figure has barely improved in the past four years. He said there had been no investment in new nationally significant supply infrastructure, such as major reservoirs, since privatisation. Craig Bennett from Friends of the Earth welcomed the comments but said Mr Gove could do much more himself to improve management of water. \"Defra are not doing enough,\" he told BBC News. \"They are still allowing new houses on flood plains \u2013 and there is constant backsliding on the need to use water more efficiently.\" Dr Matt Prescott from the Environmental Rating Agency told BBC News: \u201cThe environmental problems with the industry are a signal of financial problems \"We need effective regulation \u2013 it\u2019s clearly not happening at the moment. Politicians can\u2019t just have an obsession with bills.\" Dr Prescott said that during the recent prosecution of Thames Water at Aylesbury Crown Court they found that the Environment Agency did not have direct access to independently sourced pollution monitoring data. Instead, they had to rely on to water companies to self-monitor pollution levels discharged from sewage works. \"We think these forms of self-regulation should stop,\" he said. Water UK Chief Executive Michael Roberts countered that companies were putting public interest first. \"Water is fundamental to all of our lives, and companies fully understand their clear responsibility to act in the public interest,\" he said. \"For me, that boils down to doing the right thing in the right way, and tackling issues where they arise, because we want to maintain the high levels of trust our customers have for us. \"We know that they trust us, because more than eight out of 10 of them say so in our private polling. \"We should not lose sight of that as we address some of the issues that critics have raised. The industry is working for water, and that works for our customers.\" Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin ",

        "content": "Scientists say diabetes is five separate diseases, and treatment could be tailored to each form. Diabetes - or uncontrolled blood sugar levels - is normally split into type 1 and type 2. But researchers in Sweden and Finland think the more complicated picture they have uncovered will usher in an era of personalised medicine for diabetes. Experts said the study was a herald of the future of diabetes care but changes to treatment would not be immediate. Diabetes affects about one in 11 adults worldwide and increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, blindness, kidney failure and limb amputation. Type 1 diabetes is a disease of the immune system, which affects around 10% of people with the condition in the UK. It errantly attacks the body's insulin factories (beta-cells) so there is not enough of the hormone to control blood sugar levels. Type 2 diabetes is largely seen as a disease of poor lifestyle as body fat can affect the way the insulin works. The study, by Lund University Diabetes Centre in Sweden and the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, looked at 14,775 patients including a detailed analysis of their blood. The results, published in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology, showed the patients could be separated into five distinct clusters. Prof Leif Groop, one of the researchers, told the BBC: \"This is extremely important, we're taking a real step towards precision medicine. \"In the ideal scenario, this is applied at diagnosis and we target treatment better.\" The three severe forms could be treated more aggressively than the two milder ones, he said. Cluster 2 patients would currently be classified as type 2 as they do not have an autoimmune disease. However, the study suggests their disease is probably caused by a defect in their beta-cells rather than being too fat. And perhaps their treatment should more closely mirror patients who are currently classed as type 1. Cluster 2 had a higher risk of blindness while cluster 3 had the greatest risk of kidney disease, so some clusters may benefit from enhanced screening. Better classification\nDr Victoria Salem, a consultant and clinical scientist at Imperial College London, said most specialists knew that type 1 and type 2 was \"not a terribly accurate classification system\". She told the BBC: \"This is definitely the future of how we think about diabetes as a disease.\" But she cautioned the study would not change practice today. The study was only on Scandinavians and the risk of diabetes varies considerably around the world, such as the increased risk in South Asians. Dr Salem said: \"There is still a massively unknown quantity - it may well be that worldwide there are 500 subgroups depending on genetic and local environment effects. \"Their analysis has five clusters, but that may grow.\" Sudhesh Kumar, a professor of medicine at Warwick Medical School, said: \"Clearly this is only the first step. \"We also need to know if treating these groups differently would produce better outcomes.\" Dr Emily Burns, from Diabetes UK, said understanding the diseases could help \"personalise treatments and potentially reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications in the future\". She added: \"This research takes a promising step toward breaking down type 2 diabetes in more detail, but we still need to know more about these subtypes before we can understand what this means for people living with the condition.\" Follow James on Twitter ",

        "content": "A study of ancient DNA has shed light on the epic journeys that led to the settlement of the Pacific by humans. The region was one of the last on Earth to be permanently settled by humans who used canoes to traverse hundreds of miles of open ocean. Two different studies tracked changes over time in the genetic make-up of people inhabiting Vanuatu - regarded as a gateway to the rest of the Pacific. The work appears in Nature Ecology & Evolution and Current Biology. Prof David Reich, from Harvard Medical School, said the region had a \"tremendous\" range of human diversity, adding that Vanuatu itself had an \"extraordinary diversity of languages\" in a relatively small area. The number of languages in the tiny island state is thought to be more than 130, though several are endangered with just a few active speakers. Prof Reich, who is lead author of the study in Current Biology, added that Vanuatu was a \"gateway to the remote Pacific islands... through that region of Vanuatu and neighbouring islands, people spread all over the Pacific\". The first people to arrive in the islands belonged to the Lapita culture, who expanded out of Taiwan between 5,000 and 6,000 years ago, reaching Vanuatu about 3,000 years ago. \"They were really talented seafaring people,\" said Dr Cosimo Posth, from the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany. Dr Posth was co-author of the study in Nature Ecology & Evolution. Their secret was the specialised outrigger canoe, which is characterised by the addition of lateral support floats which stabilise the main hull. This innovation, says Dr Posth, \"allowed them to cover immense distances over the ocean\". The Lapita voyages represent the most extensive dispersal of agricultural people in history. They carried farming technology and languages belonging to the Austronesian family as far west as Madagascar and as far east as Rapa Nui (Easter Island). But modern people in the wider region have varying amounts of ancestry from \"Papuan\" populations like those that live today on New Guinea, and other islands in the Bismarck Archipelago such as the Solomons, New Britain and New Ireland. However, when exactly this ancestry spread across the region has been hotly debated. One idea was that the Lapita mixed with people speaking Papuan languages early in their voyages, spreading both types of ancestry throughout the region. Alternatively, it could be explained by more recent seafaring expansions by people from the Bismarck Archipelago. DNA from burials on Vanuatu dating from between 2,900 and 150 years ago show that the first Lapita people were genetically similar to present-day populations such as the Ami who live in Taiwan. \"The first people of these remote pacific islands had none of the Papuan ancestry from the New Guinea region that is ubiquitous today and everyone has about 25% of it,\" said Prof Reich. That means that ancestry from the south must have arrived in the region more recently. Indeed, by studying the DNA of the Vanuatu population through time, the researchers found that people bearing Papuan-like ancestry arrived in the islands around 2,600 years ago. An influx of - mostly male - newcomers steadily transformed the genetic make-up of the island. Intriguingly, all of this happened without a replacement in the language. The people of Vanuatu today speak Austronesian languages like those presumably spoken by the Lapita. This may be because a \"lingua franca\" developed in the region among seafaring, mobile people voyaging and trading across long distances. Other peoples of the Pacific, such as those living in Polynesia, derive their Papuan ancestry from a different source to the one that populated Vanuatu. \"What we're detecting is not one, but at least two movements of Papuan ancestry out into the Pacific,\" said Prof Reich. These other movements remain a focus for future studies. Dr Posth commented: \"All the islands in eastern Polynesia - from the Cook Islands to Hawaii, New Zealand, French Polynesia - were settled much later, about 1,500 years after the Lapita expansion. So there must have been further technological advancements [to the initial outrigger canoe design] that allowed people to spread even further east.\" ",

        "content": "Exceptionally detailed maps of child growth and education across Africa suggest that no single country is set to end childhood malnutrition by 2030. That target was set by the UN as a Sustainable Development Goal. However, the new maps, which give detail to the level of an individual village, show that almost every nation has at least one region where children's health is improving. They are published in Nature. The two studies have mapped child growth rates and educational attainment for women of reproductive age - tracking progress in both in 51 countries between 2000 and 2015. The scientists targeted these two factors in particular because they are important predictors of child mortality. \"Together, these are very useful indicators of where populations are doing well and where they're being left behind,\" explained Prof Simon Hay, a global health researcher from the University of Washington in the US. Prof Hay and his team pieced together data from community-level surveys and produced a series of 5km by 5km scale maps, showing child growth and educational attainment across Africa over the 15-year span of the study. 'Stark disparities'\nThis revealed that most African countries, especially much of sub-Saharan Africa and eastern and southern regions, show improvement in malnutrition. They also showed large disparities within individual countries. But by mapping these in such detail, scientists say policymakers will have the evidence to direct their resources. Kofi Annan, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former secretary general of the UN, endorsed this aim in an article he wrote in response to the maps' publication. \"Without good data,\" he wrote, \"we're flying blind. If you can't see it, you can't solve it.\" While highlighting what he called \"stark disparities\" in progress, particularly in conflict-affected areas, Mr Annan said the progress in Africa that these maps painted was \"astonishing\". \"Especially for me,\" he said, \"an African accustomed to international headlines depicting a continent consumed by war, famine and hunger. The Africa shown in these maps tells a different story - one of measurable, steady progress on issues long thought intractable. \"[But] there are villages where all children are too short for their age. Across most of the Sahel, a semi-arid swath of land from the Atlantic to the Red Sea, high rates of stunting persist, with no hint of improvement. \"Such fine-grained insight brings tremendous responsibility to act.\" Lessons to learn\nProgress in Africa has never before been mapped in this level of detail and Prof Hay said that making the data openly available and providing \"the best information we can\" would help to direct resources towards the populations most in need. \"We can look at those communities that are doing particularly well and ask if there are lessons we can learn and apply elsewhere,\" he told BBC News. In a study that is considered to have been the birth of modern epidemiology in the 19th Century, the London physician John Snow mapped cholera cases in London - revealing in a world-changing map how cases in the city were clustered around one water pump in Broad Street. This led to the revelation that the disease was spread through contaminated water. Mr Annan concluded that these maps could be as powerful in the long battle against hunger. \"They are another tool in our arsenal,\" he said. \"Alone, they won't eradicate malnutrition but they will enable Africa's leaders to act strategically.\" ",

The use of neonicotinoids has been restricted in the European Union since 2013, following earlier risk assessments. Nations will discuss a European Commission proposal to extend the ban next month. Neonicotinoids are the world's most widely used insecticide. The new assessment considered more than 1,500 studies on the impacts of three neonicotinoids - clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam. \"There is variability in the conclusions, due to factors such as the bee species, the intended use of the pesticide and the route of exposure,\" said Jose Tarazona, head of the European Food Safety Authority's pesticides unit. \"Some low risks have been identified, but overall the risk to the three types of bees we have assessed is confirmed.\" Real-world situations\nThe EU banned the use of the three chemicals on flowering crops - seen as most attractive to bees - almost five years ago in a move then opposed by the UK. The Environment Secretary Michael Gove recently reversed the government's position and said it would back a ban on non-flowering crops too, including wheat and sugar beet. A Defra spokesperson said the government had fully applied restrictions on the use of neonicotinoids introduced by the EU to date and, following an assessment by UK scientists, announced last November that it was in favour of further restrictions. \"We always keep the evidence on neonicotinoids under review and will look in detail at today's report from the European Food Safety Authority,\" said the spokesperson. \"We make all decisions on pesticides based on the science and they are only approved once regulators are satisfied they meet safety standards for people and the environment.\" However, the National Farmers Union said further restrictions were not justified as the assessments failed to take into account \"real field situations, where evidence shows there are a number of factors affecting bees\". \"The reality is that there is a balance between environmental protection and food production that has to be considered and the impacts of a 'no neonicotinoid' scenario on pollinators also need to be fully assessed,\" said NFU Senior Regulatory Affairs Adviser, Dr Chris Hartfield. Bee health\nBayer, a major producer of the neonicotinoids imidacloprid and clothianidin, said the assessments did not justify further restrictions. \"Bayer fundamentally disagrees with EFSA's updated risk assessment conclusions for the active substances imidacloprid and clothianidin,\" the company said in a statement. \"EFSA's findings place it outside the current mainstream science on bee health, as represented by recent similar assessments done by agencies such as the US EPA and Canadian PMRA.\" Bees and other insects are vital for global food production as they pollinate most crops. The decline of pollinators in recent years has been blamed on disease, habitat loss and the widespread use of pesticides. Follow Helen on Twitter. ",

Bees and other pollinators are vital to most of the world's food crops but have been in decline in recent decades due to the destruction of wild habitats, disease and pesticide use. It's not clear if hoverflies are harmed by the viruses or are simply carriers, but, either way, they could be moving them around the countryside and over long distances, say UK researchers. \"The hoverfly species that we detected the viruses in are known to migrate across Europe,\" said Emily Bailes of Royal Holloway University of London. \"They're moving a lot further than say a honey bee would and so you could be moving different types of the viruses into new places where the bees haven't been exposed to those before.\" Key driver\nInfectious diseases have been identified as a key driver of bee population declines. Scientists have a clear picture of parasites and viruses that can damage honey bees, but much less is known about what is happening in hoverflies and other pollinators. Hoverflies themselves are important pollinators of crops and wild flowers. They can be very mobile, and some migrate long distances every year. The research, carried out in collaboration with Oxford University, looked at four types of hoverflies collected at woodland in Oxfordshire. The samples were analysed in the lab for the presence of viruses. Three common bee diseases were found in two types of hoverflies that feed at the same flowers as bees. These cause symptoms like deformed wings which lead to rapid death or the bee being expelled from the hive. \"We don't really know what they're doing there yet, but because hoverflies are visiting the same flowers as bees, they could be spreading the virus around in quite a different way to the way that the bees are,\" said Dr Bailes. Ecosystem services\nKarl Wotton of the University of Exeter, who is not connected with the study, said there are about a dozen migratory hoverflies that move seasonally through Europe and in many other parts of the world. \"The numbers entering and leaving the UK each year are huge, in the billions, and all the while they provide ecosystem services including pollination and, for some species, biological control of crop pests,\" he said. They are almost certainly transferring pollen to create pollination networks that link across national borders, raising the question of whether they are doing the same with bee viruses. \"Perhaps,,\" he added, \"but it remains to be seen how the virus may affect the ability of hoverflies to undergo a strenuous long-distance migration or how long the virus may persist in their bodies given that no viral replication was detected.\" The research is published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters.

        "content": "Researchers have discovered the oldest figurative tattoos in the world on two 5,000-year-old mummies from Egypt. The illustrations are of a wild bull and a Barbary sheep on the upper-arm of a male mummy, and S-shaped motifs on the upper-arm and shoulder of a female. The discovery pushes back evidence for the practice in Africa by 1,000 years. Details of the tattoos have been published in the Journal of Archaeological Science. Daniel Antoine, one of the lead authors of the research paper and the British Museum's Curator of Physical Anthropology, said that the discovery had \"transformed\" our understanding of how people lived in this era. \"Only now are we gaining new insights into the lives of these remarkably preserved individuals. Incredibly, at over 5,000 years of age, they push back the evidence for tattooing in Africa by a millennium,\" he told BBC News. The male mummy was found about 100 years ago. Previous CT scans showed that he was between 18 and 21 years old when he died from a stab wound to the back. Dark smudges on his arm were thought to be unimportant until infrared scans revealed that they were tattoos of two slightly overlapping horned animals. One is interpreted to be a wild bull with a long tail and elaborate horns; the other appears to be a Barbary sheep with curving horns and a humped shoulder. The female mummy has four small S-shaped motifs running down her right shoulder. She also has a motif that is thought to represent batons used in ritual dance. The designs are under the skin and the pigment is probably soot. Previously, archaeologists had thought only women wore tattoos in the ancient past, but the discovery of tattoos on the male mummy now shows body modification concerned both sexes. The researchers believe that the tattoos would have denoted status, bravery and magical knowledge. The mummies were found in Gebelein in the southern part of Upper Egypt, around 40km south of modern-day Luxor. The individuals were buried in shallow graves without any special preparation, but their bodies were naturally preserved by the heat, salinity and aridity of the desert. Radiocarbon results indicate that they lived between 3351 and 3017 BC, shortly before the region was unified by the first pharaoh at around 3100 BC. The oldest example of tattooing is found on the Alpine mummy known as \u00d6tzi who is thought to have lived between 3370 and 3100 BC. But his tattoos are vertical or horizontal lines, rather than figurative. Follow Pallab on Twitter ",

        "content": "British designer Anna Bullus is on a mission to recycle chewing gum into useful objects, cleaning up our streets in the process. More than \u00a314bn is spent on chewing gum around the world each year, but a lot of that gum will end up stuck to the ground. Gum is the second most common type of street litter after cigarette materials. In the UK, councils spend around \u00a350m each year cleaning up the mess. But Anna had an idea. What if the sticky stuff could actually be recycled and turned into useful objects? Around 10 years ago, she began a project looking at kerbside litter. She examined random samples, looking at things like crisp packets and cigarette butts. She then tried to figure out which elements could be recycled. \"One of the litters I found was a piece of chewing gum and as a designer I was completely amazed there was nothing actually being done to recycle it,\" she said. Researching the chemistry of chewing gum, she discovered that its main ingredient, the gum base, is commonly a synthetic rubber, a type of polymer similar to plastic. Hear more\n\"It's called polyisobutylene,\" explains Anna, \"the same stuff you find in the inner tube of bicycle wheels.\" It is obtained from petrochemicals, which are refined from fossil fuels like crude oil. She realised that chewing gum, even once it has been finished with, is a versatile and potentially useful material. Collecting gum\nBut how do you persuade people to donate their gum - instead of carelessly tossing it on to the street? As part of her strategy, Anna created bright pink, bubble-shaped bins specially for disposing of gum called Gumdrop, which can be hung at head-height. These bins are themselves made of recycled chewing gum. A message next to the bins explains that any gum collected will be recycled into new objects. But would gum-chewers use them? The University of Winchester was one of the first places to sign up to use the bins. Around 8,000 people live and work on its campus and the authorities wanted to keep it clean of gum litter. It adopted a twin-pronged strategy to tackle the problem. It installed 11 of Anna's special bins and to reinforce the message that gum can be recycled if disposed of responsibly, it gave out hundreds of coffee cups made of recycled gum to first-year students. \"Students would give the cup a sniff to check it didn't smell of mint or bubble gum,\" recalls Liz Harris, the university's environmental officer. \"It's because so much of the chewing gum sold on the high street is a polymer [so it] can be used to make new products. 'When people get it, it's a really nice moment.\" Eighteen months later, the university noticed a drop in gum litter and is expanding the scheme. Heathrow Airport also ran a three-month trial which it said led to a \"noticeable improvement\" and saved it \u00a36,000 in cleaning costs. Great Western Railway has installed the bins in more than 25 of its railway stations and is rolling out the scheme further. In each case, the bins did not suddenly solve the problem of gum litter, but they did seem to begin to change people's behaviour. Moulding gum\nAnother challenge for Anna was to find industrial partners willing to recycle old gum - something completely novel. She eventually persuaded a recycling plant in Worcester to get on board. It takes her bins and filters out unwanted material, like paper or sweet wrappers, before grinding it into pieces and then compounds this with other recycled plastic polymers. The proportion in the mixture varies, but Anna says each object she makes contains a minimum of 20% chewing gum. At a plastic moulding specialist in Leicester called Amber Valley, which normally makes alarm casings, Anna creates her designer objects. Here, the mixture containing the old chewing gum is put into an injection moulding machine. It is heated and then ejected as a paste, which can be moulded into new objects as it cools. \"There's no difference [from] the equivalent polypropylene material that it's based against, the processing temperatures and parameters are all identical,\" says Brett Nixon, a manager at the plant. \"When you are handling the finished product, you do take a while to adjust to the fact that this has been in somebody's mouth previously. 'But once you get over that fear it's easy. By recycling it and giving it another lease of life it's helping the environment, it's an absolutely fantastic idea.\" Industry response\nThe UK Parliament has considered imposing taxes on chewing gum companies if they do not do more to combat gum litter. Anna's project has been given financial support from Wrigley, one of the largest manufacturers. It also provides her with surplus material from its Plymouth factory to add to her supply. Alex Hunter-Dunn, a spokesman for Wrigley, explained why the company backs the project. \"Gumdrop is a really creative and innovative way to get people responsibly disposing of their gum and binning it. We fundamentally believe that behaviour change is the only long-term sustainable solution to tackle the issue and we are very much behind that.\" Other approaches are being tried to beat the scourge of gum litter. Researchers have worked on a synthetic chewing gum that is biodegradable and will wash off the streets more easily, which is also the case with an organic chewing gum, made from Chicle gum native to Central America, which has a small market. But in the current market, dominated by synthetic, non-biodegradable gum, Anna thinks her method is the best option on the table. \"I do believe that through right design, \" she says, \"we can actually change the way people behave.\" Follow Dougal Shaw on Twitter @dougalshawbbc You can learn more about recycling chewing gum in the latest People Fixing the World podcastfrom the BBC World Service ",

        "content": "A British team is developing a car that will be capable of reaching 1,000mph (1,610km/h). Powered by a rocket bolted to a Eurofighter-Typhoon jet engine, the vehicle aims to show its potential by going progressively faster, year after year. In 2018, Bloodhound wants to run above 500mph. In 2019, the goal is to raise the existing world land speed record (763mph; 1,228km/h) to 800mph. And in 2020, the intention is to exceed 1,000mph. The racing will take place on Hakskeen Pan in Northern Cape, South Africa. Plans are developing nicely for our forthcoming \"Bloodhound 500\" test session later this year. Bloodhound's chief executive, Richard Noble, has just returned from a hugely busy week of meetings in South Africa. Richard met with the South African Government, the British High Commission team, a whole list of companies (who all want to help) and a range of national media. No surprise that everyone is getting excited about Bloodhound going to South Africa this Autumn. While we're busy planning the event schedule for our test runs (lots of you keep asking for more details; I promise we'll update everyone soon!), there's plenty of research still going on to understand how the car will behave. One of the key things we are looking at is noise. How much noise will the car generate? How will this noise affect the structure of the car, the driver (me!) and the watching crowds? The noise will come from two main sources. The jet engine and the rocket motor will create a lot (and I mean A LOT) of noise at the back end of the car, with a bit of jet intake jet noise over the cockpit as well. At supersonic speeds, I don't have to worry about the jet intake noise anymore, as I'll be travelling faster than the sound the jet engine is making. However, at that point, the supersonic shockwaves start to generate some fairly large \"acoustic energy effects\". In other words, they will probably create even more noise than the jet intake, so it's going to be noisy whatever speed we're doing. You may be surprised to hear that I'm not that worried about the noise levels in the cockpit. During our \"slow speed\" (200mph) tests at Cornwall Airport Newquay last year, we found that the cockpit was not as noisy as we had first thought. If we find it's getting too noisy when we go faster (like supersonic fast), then we can fit a lot more sound-proofing. We've already got a big box of something called \"Basotech\" (the same sound-absorbing foam that Ariane rockets use), ready to fit in the cockpit if required. We're not too worried about the effects on the crowd either, as there are some easy solutions. First, we'll be monitoring the noise levels at the edge of the track, when the car runs. If it gets too noisy, then we'll simply move the crowd line back further (don't worry if you're coming to see us, it won't be too far and you'll still get a fabulous view!). In fact, the main problem may come when we get round to timing our final runs, to set a new World Land Speed Record. At this point we need FIA timekeepers, who traditionally use a few hundred metres of cable to record their timing light signals. We've already warned them that they are probably going to need wireless timing equipment, as they are likely to be a kilometre of more back from the track. The real thing we're concerned about is the noise effects on the car. Back in 1997, when we set the current World Land Speed Record, we saw quite a lot of acoustic damage to the car. This included cracking of the titanium panels at the rear of the car, due to the shattering noise of the jet engine exhaust. The supersonic shockwaves also did their fair share of damage. We had to replace one of the body panels under the car, which was cracked by shockwave vibrations. Things like rocket motors can produce so much energy that they risk destroying the vehicle (usually a spacecraft) that they are attached to. For example, the Space Shuttle had to use massive water sprays to damp down the acoustic energy at launch. And I do mean \"massive' - they sprayed over one million litres of water on to the launch pad in just over half a minute, to prevent acoustic damage to the payload and crew. That's a lot of water and a lot of noise. Bloodhound is not going to be using anything the size of the Shuttle main engines, which is just as well, as there's nowhere on the car to keep a million litres of water. We can't just ignore the problem, though. Between them, the Rolls-Royce jet engine and the Nammo hybrid rocket will make Bloodhound SSC the loudest (as well as the fastest) car in history. We need to make sure that all this noise is not going to damage the back end of the car. This is where our new best friend Nick Eaton of Space Acoustics comes in. Nick is developing an \"advanced numerical solution to noise from turbulent mixing\" for Bloodhound. In short, that means he's modelling the noise. His first model is for a speed of Mach 0.8, in other words 80% of the speed of sound, or around 600mph. That's comfortably above our Bloodhound 500 target for this year of 500+ mph, to give us some worst-case noise figures to look at for this year's testing. This year's test runs will be with our EJ200 jet engine only, as the rocket development will not be completed until next year. For the test programme, that makes things simpler, as we can focus on two cases - jet engine at full power (measuring the total noise exposure of the car) and jet engine off (measuring the noise from the airflow only, as the car slows down). That will give us accurate figures for the airflow noise and, by measuring the difference with power on, for the jet engine noise. Nick can then use these figures to improve the accuracy of his model (if required), before we fit the rocket and start doing supersonic runs. Before I talk about the expected noise levels, I have to touch on the difficult subject of noise measurement. Nick's figures are looking at something called the Sound Pressure Level (SPL), which is a measure of the pressure caused by the sound waves. This is ideal for Bloodhound's requirements, as we want to understand how the sound might affect the structure of the car, so it's the pressure that we're interested in. Slightly confusingly, the sound pressure is different to the power or energy of the sound wave, for reasons I won't attempt to explain - just take my word for it. The SPL is measured relative to a reference pressure, which is the quietest sound that you can hear. To make things a bit more complicated, it's measured on a logarithmic scale, in units called decibels, or dB. The quietest sound your ear can detect is reference pressure at 0 dB(SPL). On this scale, 20 dB(SPL) is 10 times the sound intensity of 0 dB, and 40 dB(SPL) is 100 times the intensity. Confused? Yes, me too. Let's stick to some simple examples. If 0 dB(SPL) is the quietest sound you can hear, then the \"pain threshold\" of sound, where the noise starts to cause you injury, is around 120-130 dB(SPL). The variation is because the pain threshold is slightly subjective: a really loud (130 dB(SPL)) rock concert may well be \"great music\" to a 20-year old and \"painful noise\" to someone over 40\u2026. With 130 dB(SPL) as a \"painfully loud\" reference (at least for me - I'm over 40), the sound levels around BLOODHOUND may make a bit more sense. The predicted noise level (SPL) at the cockpit is 135 dB, so it may not be comfortable, but it's nothing to be scared of. I'll be wearing a full-face helmet and Ultimate Ear moulded earplugs (like you see the F1 drivers using), so I'm well protected against this level of noise. Of more interest is the prediction for noise at the back on the car, where the SPL figure is 150 dB. This is really quite loud. Unhelpfully, most of the examples of this kind of noise level are things like military jet engines or heavy artillery gunfire. Unless you work with military jets or heavy artillery, this doesn't mean much. More exciting is the sort of effects that it has on the human body, which are variously quoted as \"chest cavity vibrates\", \"giddiness\" and \"choking\". This noise level will damage more than just your hearing. OK, we'll make sure that we all keep well back. Question is, what's it going to do to the car itself? Now that we have this data, our engineering team can start to look at exactly this question. Better still, we can measure the effects on the car when we start testing it later this year. If you want to see how we get on, come along and join us for our first high-speed test session this autumn in South Africa. We'd love to see you there. Don't forget to bring your earplugs. ",

        "content": "Imagine being able to charge your electric car in minutes rather than hours, or your smartphone in seconds. That's the enticing prospect being touted by researchers who reckon they've discovered a new material that could boost the performance of a carbon-based supercapacitor - sometimes called an ultracapacitor - a type of energy storage device that can be charged very quickly and offload its power very quickly, too. Dr Donald Highgate, director of research at Superdielectrics Ltd, says a material he originally developed for soft contact lenses is also surprisingly good at holding an electrostatic field. Very simply, supercapacitors don't produce electricity through chemical reactions as conventional batteries do, they create these electrostatic fields. Dr Highgate is working with Bristol and Surrey universities to develop supercapacitors using the new polymer and hopes that they could eventually rival, or even surpass, lithium-ion (li-ion) batteries - so long as they manage to replicate prototype performance on a large scale. So far, supercapacitors have been good at providing quick bursts of power - to start a car engine, for example, or to give trains a boost when accelerating. They're also well-suited to harvesting energy from vehicles when they brake, making them an important component in electric vehicles. And national electricity grids use them to provide quick power top-ups when balancing supply and demand. South Korea's capital Seoul is hoping to have 3,500 supercapacitor-powered buses operating by 2020, and they're also being used in Shanghai, China. European car maker PSA Peugeot Citroen has been using them in its cars since 2010 - supercapacitor maker Maxwell Technologies says more than a million vehicles now incorporate its products. But to date, supercapacitors haven't been very good at holding much power or holding on to that power for very long. This poor energy density, as it's called, the amount of power they can hold per kilogramme, has put them at a significant disadvantage to li-ion batteries. More Technology of Business\n\"The two main advantages of conventional supercapacitors over batteries are their ability to handle much higher charge and discharge rates, and their longer cycle life,\" says Gareth Hinds, Fellow of the UK's National Physical Laboratory. \"The downside is that they tend to be relatively high cost and can only store a few seconds-, or at most, minutes-worth of power.\" This isn't a problem when your supercapacitor is being used to power a tool on a factory assembly line, for example. It can be recharged in seconds once it's placed back in its charging dock. But it is if you're in an electric car or bus that needs recharging every few miles. Taavi Madiberk, chief executive and co-founder of Skeleton Technologies, a supercapacitor maker based in Estonia, Germany and Finland, says his products incorporate layers of graphene - a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice - and other carbon-based materials in its supercapacitors. These layers have a huge surface area - just 1g of graphene can cover 2,000 sq m, says Mr Madiberk. This allows them to hold on to a lot more power. His firm's products are already used in hybrid vehicles, particularly buses and lorries. In one experiment, they installed supercapacitors in a Sainsbury's supermarket diesel-electric delivery van and \"achieved 32% fuel savings\", says Mr Madiberk. But he acknowledges that in the short-term, combining supercapacitors with li-ion batteries is probably the best way to enjoy the best of both worlds, particularly in electric vehicles. Ulrik Grape, chief executive of NaWa technologies, another supercapacitor maker based in the South of France, agrees, saying: \"Supercapacitors don't store as much energy but their response is instantaneous. So a supercapacitor could handle acceleration and energy recovery under braking - taking care of the stressful part of a battery's life - possibly doubling or tripling a battery's life expectancy.\" NaWa's technology involves electrodes made from \"vertically aligned carbon and graphene nanotubes that can store the energy on the surface of these tubes,\" explains Mr Grape. These tubes, which are coated with another carbon-based material, are so tiny you can fit 10 billion of them in a square centimetre. As carbon is a light material, incorporating supercapacitors into li-ion batteries would also reduce the overall weight, and this would improve the range performance of an electric vehicle. A Formula E racing car's battery, currently made by Williams Advanced Engineering, weighs 300kg, but this could be reduced by a third to 200kg, NaWa believes, without any loss of range. \"We think the ability to charge and discharge a battery fast will be one of the most important things in the future,\" says Mr Grape. \"We don't have as much energy as a lithium-ion battery but we can do many more cycles - charges and discharges - up to a million. Carbon is such a robust material.\" By contrast, a normal battery, which relies on chemical reactions to create electricity, eventually wears out once those chemicals lose their potency - after about 3,000 to 5,000 cycles of charging and discharging. Another advantage of supercapacitors, makers say, is that they don't require rare materials, such as cobalt. Of course, supercapacitors don't mean the end of traditional batteries by any means. Li-ion technology is still being improved by about 5-10% each year. New forms of energy storage will be critical to the success of renewable energy as a replacement for fossil fuels. When the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow, we'll need to access stored energy very quickly to plug the gap. As well as traditional energy storage methods, such as pumped hydro, flywheels, compressed gas and large battery arrays, highly efficient supercapacitors could eventually become a crucial component in a fully sustainable energy network. But these are early days. \"Polymer-based supercapacitors are emerging as a promising technology,\" concludes Gareth Hinds, \"but there is a lot of work still to do to achieve the required energy storage capacity without compromising on power, lifetime and cost.\" ",

        "content": "A recent report has said the south Indian city of Bangalore could be doomed, like Cape Town in South Africa, to face the threat of running out of drinking water. But is this really the case? The BBC's Imran Qureshi investigates. The fact that Bangalore is under \"water stress\" cannot be denied. The term is used to refer to pressure on water resources which causes problems like shortages. Officials and experts admit the growth of the city has put pressure on its water resources, particularly because in the last few years alone more than 100 villages have been absorbed into this rapidly expanding metropolis, known as India's Silicon Valley. In 2012, nine million people lived in Bangalore. Now, there are 11 million. Government officials say shortage of water is a very real problem, particularly in the peripheral areas of the city which are already dependant on tankers for drinking water supply. These tankers get their supply from borewells, but as demand increases they are being forced to dig deeper and deeper to find water. The Bangalore water supply and sewerage board ( BWSSB), the agency that provides drinking water and manages the city's sewage system, acknowledges that in 2014, a survey predicted Bangalore was on the verge of running out of water. But, they say the situation has changed since then - one critical government decision just may have staved off complete disaster, at least for now. In 2013, the government decided to divert an additional 10 thousand million cubic feet of water from the Cauvery river to Bangalore for its drinking water needs. The Cauvery is the principal source of water for not just the city, but also for the irrigation needs of much of Karnataka state where Bangalore is located. And Cauvery water is precious. The state has been involved for more than a century in a dispute over sharing water resources from the river with neighbouring Tamil Nadu state. The Supreme Court has had to intervene on multiple occasions, but has also permitted states to prioritise the use of water for drinking purposes. \"The current supply of water to Bangalore amounts to about 100 litres of water per person per day,\" Tushar Girinath, chairman of the water supply board, told the BBC. Officials estimate that by diverting the river water, the city will gain a little more than 50% of its current supply. The project, called \"Cauvery Water Supply Stage Five\", is funded by the Japanese International Cooperation Agency. The additional supply is expected to help Bangalore provide drinking water to a 225 sq km (87 sq-mile) area that is currently dependent upon water supplied via borewells and tankers. In addition to the additional supply from the Cauvery, the city will in the next 18 months also receive water from another river called the Nethravati. Mr Girinath said this would make the water position of the city more \"comfortable\". \"Yes, we will face some water stress until 2023. But we certainly are not facing a crisis, because we are augmenting the supply,\" he said. Officials say the plan has taken the rapid growth of the city into account. Merely increasing supply will not be enough to ensure Bangalore has adequate water supply though. The city's residents also need to participate in conservation and harvesting efforts. But this has not been the case so far. The water board has run massive campaigns promoting rainwater harvesting in an effort to help replenish ground water supplies. But this has got a disappointing response. It is mandatory for people to construct rainwater harvesting facilities at their homes, but this is often ignored. The board in fact, collects a sum of more than 20m rupees (about $300,000; \u00a3222,000) in fines every month from people who have not complied. \"Bangalore's annual rainfall alone could give the city 2,740 million litres of water a day,\" Vishwanath Srikantaiah, a water expert, told the BBC. Mr Girinath adds that people will also have to begin recycling water using their own sewage treatment plants. \"They will also have to understand that the board cannot provide treated water. Our sewage treatment plants are so huge that we have set them up outside the city. So, we expect people living in complexes housing 50 or more apartments to construct smaller plants to treat water for their own needs,\" he said. A sewage treatment plant small enough to be used by an apartment costs around 750,000 rupees to install. People living in smaller houses or slums will get free treated water from the water board. \"Of the 100 litres used by every person per day, people need only 20 litres for cooking, drinking water and bathing purposes. The remaining 80 litres is used for non-potable purposes like flushing toilets, cleaning floors and washing cars,'' BN Tyagaraja, who headed an expert panel to look for additional water sources, told the BBC. \"The citizens have to realise that water is a scarce commodity. Not just in Bangalore but across the world. We need to conserve water,\" he said. Mr Srikantaiah agrees. \"Bangalore is not likely to run out of water but we will have to manage it well,\" he says.

        "content": "Since the beginning of the year, Nigeria has been gripped by an outbreak of a deadly disease. Lassa fever is one of a number of illnesses which can cause dangerous epidemics, but for which no vaccine currently exists. Lassa fever is not a new disease, but the current outbreak is unprecedented, spreading faster and further than ever before. Health workers are overstretched, and a number have themselves become infected and died. The potentially fatal disease is a so-called \"viral haemorrhagic fever\", which can affect many organs, and damage the body's blood vessels. But it is difficult to treat. Most people who catch Lassa will have only mild symptoms such as fever, headache and general weakness. They may have none at all. However, in severe cases, it can mimic another deadly haemorrhagic fever, Ebola, causing bleeding through the nose, mouth and other parts of the body. Lassa fever normally has a fatality rate of about one per cent. But in the Nigerian outbreak it is thought to be more than 20% among confirmed and probable cases, according to the country's Centre for Disease Control. Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria\n22% fatality rate among confirmed and probable cases 1081 suspected cases (1 January - 25 February) 90 deaths 14 health care workers affected in six states About 90 people are thought to have died so far, but the true number may be much higher, because Lassa is so hard to diagnose. Women who contract the disease late in pregnancy face an 80% chance of losing their child, or dying themselves. In the early stages it's almost impossible to distinguish from other common diseases like malaria and dengue. With no readily available test, the only way to confirm a diagnosis is to analyse a blood or tissue sample in one of small number of specialised laboratories. The disease was first identified in the Nigerian town of Lassa in 1969, after an outbreak in a mission hospital. It has since been seen in many West African countries including Ghana, Mali and Sierra Leone. However, this outbreak is causing particular concern because the number of cases is unusually high for the time of year. Health officials are working to understand why. Outbreaks can be influenced by seasonal weather conditions, which affect the numbers of the virus's natural host - the multimammate rat. These small mammals are common across West Africa, where they easily find their way into homes. Another possibility is that the high number of cases reflects heightened public awareness. Or it's possible that something about the virus has changed. Most people catch Lassa fever from anything contaminated with rat urine, faeces, blood or saliva - through eating, drinking or simply handling contaminated objects in the home. It can also pass from person to person through bodily fluids, meaning healthcare workers and people taking care of sick relatives without protective equipment are particularly at risk. The incubation period for Lassa is up to three weeks. Researchers are trying to work out whether - like Ebola - Lassa can stay in the body and be passed on through sexual contact even after illness subsides. Nigeria has a strong public health system, and is used to dealing with epidemics like this. The World Health Organization (WHO) is working with Nigerian authorities to help coordinate the response and the UK government has deployed a team of experts from its Public Health Rapid Support Team. Those living in affected areas are being advised to take basic precautions: blocking holes that may allow rats to enter their homes, disposing of rubbish in covered dustbins, and storing food and water in sealed containers. People are advised to wear protective gloves when caring for anyone who may have Lassa fever, and to carry out safe burial practices. Despite these measures, the fight against Lassa - and other infectious diseases - is hampered by a lack of effective medical tools like diagnostic tests, treatments and vaccines. It is likely that a vaccine could be found for Lassa - reducing the possibility of an outbreak becoming a global health emergency - but as with other epidemic diseases that mainly affect poorer countries, progress has stalled. Vaccine development is a long, complex and costly process. This is especially true for emerging epidemic diseases, where a prototype vaccine can usually only be tested where there is an outbreak. A new organisation called CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations) - set up in 2017 with financial support from the Wellcome Trust, national governments and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation - hopes to accelerate vaccine production. Lassa is one of the diseases on its hit list and it's hoped one or more promising vaccines will be ready for large-scale testing in the next five years. The WHO has drawn up a list of other serious, but often poorly understood diseases, with the potential for devastating outbreaks, including MERS, Nipah, Rift Valley Fever and, of course, Ebola. It plans to highlight gaps in our knowledge of these diseases and to begin further research. But research alone isn't enough. Stronger health systems are needed in the countries where epidemics are most likely to arise. This could mean building better healthcare facilities and training staff to recognise and respond to outbreaks. It will also mean working with communities to understand how to identify outbreaks at an early stage and prevent their spread.

        "content": "At a trendy east London bar, a group of body hackers are putting forward their reasons for human augmentation to a packed audience of mainly under-35s, many of whom are sporting piercings and tattoos. Putting a chip under your skin is not so very different from getting a piercing or tattoo, argued one of the panellists - except there was often less blood. For some, transhumanism - the theory that the human race can evolve beyond its physical and mental limitations with the help of technology - is a crucial part of the advancement of society. Bio-hacker Lepht Anonym has nine implants and strongly believes what she does will benefit humankind as well as her own curiosity. But she admits it can be painful. \"The magnets in my fingers really, really hurt. They hurt so much that your vision goes white for a bit. Really, really painful.\" The magnets allow her to sense electromagnetic radiation so she can tell if a device is on or off, whether a microwave is running and identify where power lines are. All of which, she admits, is \"not hugely useful\". She also has a chip under her skin that lets her interact with her phone and unlock doors. She hopes that the \"primitive results\" she has achieved can be used by other, more skilled people, to build something better. \"The bio-hacking community is a co-operative. It is about improving the quality of life for people but in a practical way.\" Hygiene issues\nNot everyone is a fan of the trend. Andreas Sjostrom, who leads CapGemini's global mobility practice, had an implant in 2015 which allowed him to download his customer number from airline tickets and get through security gates with a swipe of his hand. It got him noticed by security staff at the airport and worked but he has since become more cynical about the technology. \"In order for this to be widely used or adopted it has to improve on the current situation,\" he said. \"The hardware that reads such chips is designed for a flat surface such as you'd find in a card,\" he explained, adding that chips in hands are often not recognised by the readers. \"And, if everyone is pressing their hands on the reader, that is less hygienic.\" It is estimated that more than 10,000 people around the world have chip implants in their bodies, making it far from mainstream but clearly a growing trend. The current range of implants includes magnets that are installed into fingertips, radio frequency identification chips (RFiD) implanted in hands, and even LED lights that can shine beneath the skin. Chips used for opening doors carry a unique serial number the can be read by a device attached to whatever you want to open and one chip can carry multiple numbers meaning you do not need a separate chip for everything you want to access. Amal Graafstra provides such implants via his firm Dangerous Things and thinks there are three good reasons to have an implant. \"We all carry with us keys, wallet and phone. These are major burdens, they are so important for modern life but everyone hates carrying them. \"With a simple implant that uses less energy and carries less risk than an ear-piercing, you can replace them.\" He is able to access not only his house but his car via the implant under his skin, although he admits that getting the device to work with his car required \"a bit of hacking\". But he envisions a future where chips can do far more - and that, he predicts, will attract more people to the community of bio-hacking. \"If someone could use an implant to get on the train, buy coffee, secure their computer, secure their data, get into their house, drive a car - all of these possible applications will compel a lot more adoption.\" For Matt Eagles, the implant he has in his brain is not a luxury so much as a necessity to cope with the Parkinson's disease he has had since he was a child. He has two 15cm electrodes that run deep into his brain and create two bumps on his head which he affectionately refers to as \"baby giraffe horns\". The implants are attached to a pulse generator in his chest, which disrupts the electrical signals to his brain and allows him to walk. \"They have given me back my dignity. When you struggle to turn over in bed at night or can't get out of bed to go to the bathroom, to be suddenly able to do so is a huge plus.\" It has also given him back confidence to pursue his love of photography - he was an accredited football photographer at the 2012 Olympics - and, perhaps most importantly, he has got married. Many regard medicine as being the real mainstream application for bio-hacking, from cochlear implants which improve hearing loss to smart pills that can be ingested and access, analyse and manipulate bodily functions. Some bio-hackers are ready to go one step further. In October 2017, Josiah Zayner, who has a doctorate in biochemistry and molecular biophysics from the University of Chicago, injected his arm with DNA from a gene-editing tool called Crispr. It is a stunt that he has since said he regrets but his attempt to edit his own genes - in this case to trigger a genetic change in his cells to increase muscle mass - made headlines at the time, largely around the ethics of such experimentation. \"There is a continuum between therapy and enhancement and it is difficult to draw the line between where medicine ends and enhancement begins,\" said Prof John Harris, an ethicist from the University of Manchester. \"As for gene editing the tools are available and relatively cheap and easy to use, but people would be extremely ill-advised to try it.\" There has also been objections on religious grounds from some, with Mr Sjostrom receiving negative feedback from a group in the Christian community. \"They see implantable technology and assume the end of times are here and that it is the mark of the beast. It is important to know how to deal with this technology from a theological point of view.\" ",

        "content": "Cities across Europe have been hit by a Siberian snow blast this week - also known as \"the Beast from the East\". Even Mediterranean islands such as Corsica and Capri haven't escaped; parts of Spain and Italy have seen their first snowfall in years; and in the UK, there has been widespread disruption to transport and schools. But despite this wintry weather, in some places snow is actually getting rarer. For it to snow, you need a big enough cloud and, perhaps most obviously, temperatures close to or below freezing. Data from the principal organisations monitoring global temperatures all show they are rising. For example, according to Nasa, global average temperatures were 0.9C higher in 2017 than the 1951-80 average. And in the past 27 years, there is no year when annual global average temperatures have been cooler than the 1961-90 average. So how is this increase in temperature affecting snowfall? The UK picture\nAccording to a report by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), there is evidence that the number of times snow is observed in a year has reduced - a sense of this change can be gained by looking at the animation below of data from the Met Office. If you look at Merseyside, for example, between 1961 and 1990, the area would normally have about 20 to 30 days of snow falling each year. By 1981-2010, that had reduced to about 10 to 20 days per year. Of course, there's variation across the country. Elevation of the land is an important factor as air cools by 1C for each 100m (330ft) increase in altitude, so upland parts of the UK have a greater number of days of snowfall than low areas. North-eastern areas have more snow than milder south-western areas. Snowfall in the UK is often difficult to predict, with 10ths of a degree Celsius making the difference between cold rain or snow - a nightmare for forecasters. However, the Met Office Regional Climate model simulation has shown that the trend of decreasing days of winter snow in the UK will probably continue. Will snow become rarer in other parts of the world?\nNot necessarily - it's a mixed picture. According to a report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) the fraction of precipitation falling as snow in winter has changed little in places that are more than 55 degrees north of the equator. That's because the air is already very cold and rising temperatures haven't made much difference. In some cases, higher temperatures have actually led to more snow. Around the Great Lakes of North America, for example, there's actually been a large increase in the amount of lake-effect snow observed. In the past, the Great Lakes would have been more often covered by ice in winter, effectively putting a lid on them and preventing moisture from evaporating into the atmosphere to make snow. With less ice on the lakes in recent winters, there's more evaporation - and so more snow. But the IPCC did report declines in the proportion of annual precipitation falling as snow in some specific areas: This may be due to more marginal temperatures or an earlier onset of spring there. So for some, snow could become rarer in the future, but this may cause further headaches. Disruption from snow tends to be worse in areas where snow occurs less frequently, whether from lack of investment in snow-clearing infrastructure, or people just being unused to the conditions. So even if snow does become scarcer in a future warmer world, that doesn't mean we'll see an end to problems on the roads, rails and airports caused by snow anytime soon.

        "content": "Should we burn waste plastic - or bury it? Since China refused last month to accept any more foreign waste for recycling, the UK is facing a challenge. How can it recycle more of its own waste? And should it bury or burn the low-grade waste that it can't recycle? We're trying to answer the second question. And it certainly divides opinions. So what are the facts about plastic waste? Well, according to the HMRC's UK trade info website, about 800,000 tonnes of plastic waste was exported from the UK for recycling to nations like China in 2014. News reports suggest much of this was contaminated by other rubbish, and had to be burned. The UK itself was left with 1,244,774 tonnes of packaging sent either to landfill or incineration in 2016. The National Packaging Waste Database estimates that 1,015,226 tonnes of plastics packaging was recycled in 2016. Remember, this is packaging, not all plastic waste. So should we burn our hard-to-recycle waste, or bury it? The case for burning\nHere's the case for burning. Plastic is made from oil and gas, and it creates a lot of heat when it's burned. So at first sight it makes sense to harness that by burning it in an incinerator to make electricity. It's even more efficient if the incinerator can capture the waste heat from the process and use it to warm offices and homes. Burning plastic this way currently substitutes in some places for burning dirty fossil fuels like oil or coal. Mark Pawsey, the Conservative MP for Rugby, is chairman of the All-Party Group for the Packaging Manufacturing Industry. He told the Commons: \"Waste is used to generate the heat that enables the cement company based in my constituency to manufacture cement. \"That strikes me as a much better use of the calorific value of packaging than sending it to landfill.\" His argument is supported by the people who run incineration - the Environmental Services Association (ESA). Its director Jacob Hayler told us: \"It is better to recover energy from non-recyclable waste through (incineration), than send it to landfill.\" He quotes the government's Digest of UK Energy Statistics (DUKES) saying that in 2016, the waste used to fuel Energy from Waste (EfW) was equivalent to replacing 2.5m tonnes of virgin fossil fuel oil. Mr Hayler says that overall greenhouse gas emissions from incineration are lower than from landfill. So it seems there's a strong case for incineration - but it's not quite that simple. Because those statistics are based on the incineration of general waste including plastics - not of plastic waste alone. Much of our household waste in landfills does indeed create greenhouse gases that heat the world, unless they are captured as landfill gas. But this doesn't apply to plastics, which are extremely stable. They don't break down in landfill, so don't emit greenhouse gases. And, in fact, there's a strong case against incinerating plastics. So what's the case for burial?\nBurning plastic creates harmful dioxins and if incinerators are inefficient, these leak into the environment. Modern incinerators are said to have largely solved this problem. But climate change is another consideration. The consultancy Eunomia says plastics burned in incinerators set up to generate only electricity create heat at 25% efficiency. This is much lower than the 55% efficiency for new gas-fired power stations. Dominic Hogg from Eunomia told BBC News: \"When coal is phased out for generating electricity, incineration of unrecycled waste will be the most CO2-intensive form of generation. \"This doesn't make sense if the government's trying to reduce CO2 emissions - unless the government takes drastic action to reduce the amount of plastic in unrecycled waste.\" Environment groups also fear that if the UK builds new incinerators to cope with the stockpile created by China's rejection of waste plastic, the policy will lock in a demand for burning waste plastic that ideally should get recycled. The government seems to have been persuaded by this argument. The environment minister Therese Coffey told the Commons: \"In environmental terms, it is generally better to bury plastic than to burn it.\" Capturing carbon emissions\nIndeed we could go one step further and make the case that burying waste plastic in landfill is actually a cheap form of carbon capture and storage. Governments have been promising for decades to develop plants that will capture the carbon emissions from power stations and force them into underground rocks. Burying plastic would have the same effect of locking up unwanted carbon at a fraction of the cost. Elena Polisano, Oceans Campaigner for Greenpeace UK reluctantly agrees. She told BBC News: \"We should reduce, reuse, and recycle, in that order. \"When we get to the stage of deciding whether to burn or bury waste, we have already failed, failed some more and then failed again. \"However, it is safer to contain that failure than to spread it through the atmosphere in the form of toxic gases.\" The question may seem rather academic. But it is highly pertinent for a government whose environment secretary is preparing a new plan for waste - and who has stated that the UK must \"stop offshoring our dirt\".

        "content": "A new dam on the Nile could trigger a war over water unless Ethiopia can agree a deal with Egypt and Sudan, writes the BBC's Africa Correspondent Alastair Leithead. It is often said the world's next world war will be fought over water and there are few places as tense as the River Nile. Egypt and Ethiopia have a big disagreement, Sudan is in the middle, and a big geopolitical shift is being played out along the world's longest river. There's been talk about a dam on the Blue Nile for many years, but when Ethiopia started to build, the Arab Spring was underway and Egypt was distracted. \"Egypt was the gift of the Nile\" the pharaohs said, and they worshiped the river as a god. Explore the Nile with 360 video\nJoin the BBC's Africa correspondent Alastair Leithead and his team, travelling from the Blue Nile's source to the sea - through Ethiopia and Sudan into Egypt. This 360\u00b0 video is a version of the first VR documentary series from BBC News. To view the full films, click here. For thousands of years, and more recently buoyed by British colonialism, Egypt has wielded political influence over the Nile. But the ambition of Ethiopia is changing all that. There are few African countries with a plan to deal with the doubling of the continent's population over the next 30 years. Yet despite its political challenges and its limited freedoms, industrial parks are being built as Ethiopia seeks to transform itself into a middle-income country, and so it needs electricity. Africa's largest hydroelectric power station and one of the world's largest dams will do that, but with 85% of the river emerging from the Ethiopian highlands, Egypt is concerned its rival has the capability to control the flow of the river. \"It's one of the most important flagship projects for Ethiopia,\" says Seleshi Bekele, the country's Minister for Water, Irrigation and Electricity. \"It's not about control of the flow, but providing opportunity for us to develop ourselves through energy development. It has a lot of benefit for the downstream countries.\" And Sudan certainly welcomes it. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is just a few kilometres from the border and the pylons are already in place, waiting for the power generation to begin and for cheap, renewable power to fizz through the cables. Dams also regulate the flow of the river. At the moment the difference between high water and low water level in Sudan is 8m, and that makes its vast irrigation projects harder to manage. With the dam in place, the difference will be 2m and the flow of the river will come year-round. \"For Sudan it's wonderful,\" says says Osama Daoud Abdellatif, the owner of the Dal Group which runs farms and irrigation projects. \"It's the best thing that's happened for a long time and I think the combination of energy and regular water levels is a great blessing.\" He understands that Egypt is worried, as the UN predicts the country will start suffering water shortages by 2025. \"The Nile is the lifeline of Egypt, so for them, I wouldn't say they are paranoid, but they are very concerned about anything that you do with that water.\" Any threat to Egypt's water is considered a threat to its sovereignty. \"It's very much a game changer, a new order is beginning in the whole region now,\" believes Rawia Tawfik, an Egyptian academic working in Germany. \"Ethiopia for the first time is combining both the physical power of being an upstream country that can in one way or another control the River Nile's flow, and the economic power of being able to construct a dam depending on its own domestic resources.\" And Egypt's minister of water resources and irrigation, Mohamed Abdel Aty, is extremely angry. \"We are responsible for a nation of about 100 million\", he says. \"If the water that's coming to Egypt reduced by 2% we would lose about 200,000 acres of land. \"One acre at least makes one family survive. A family in Egypt is average family size about five persons. So this means about one million will be jobless. \"It is an international security issue.\" Hydroelectric power stations do not consume water, but the speed with which Ethiopia fills up the dam will affect the flow downstream. They would like the water to be generating power as soon as possible, but it should take time to fill up a reservoir which is going to be bigger than Greater London and will flood the Nile for 250km (155 miles) upstream. If it is filled within three years the level of the river will be affected, but over six or seven years it won't have a major impact on water level. Negotiations between Egypt and Ethiopia are not going well. The discussions aren't even at the stage of assessing the impact, but are still about how that will be determined. Sudan and Egypt are also at loggerheads over how much water Sudan uses - and how that amount may increase when the dam is finished. The irony is Egypt did in the 1960s exactly what Ethiopia is doing today, when it built the Aswan High Dam. For a revolutionary post-colonial country it was a proud national achievement, and Ethiopia sees it in the same way. Ethiopia wants to pay for this project itself without international help. Government workers are giving a month's salary a year to the project - and not all are happy about that. There is a lottery to fund the dam and bonds are being put up for sale. The dam is impressive. After five years it is two-thirds finished - and it already crosses the river. There is nothing Egypt can do about it, except take military action which would be extreme. That is why diplomacy and collaboration are the only means of resolving this issue. But when issues like nationalism and the relative strength and importance of countries is concerned, it muddies the water. The world's first war over water can be avoided on the Nile, and it could even be an example of how to resolve complex disagreements over water. But it will take a lot more effort to navigate an agreement between Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt. ",

        "content": "\"When you're on top of the water, and you just see the fin, I think it's more scary because it's the unknown. But when you are underwater and you see the shark it is much less scary. When I saw him for the first time, he was bigger than expected and so much more colourful.\" This is what a 26-year-old woman, a tourist from England, told researchers after going down in an aluminium cage into the choppy waters off the coast of Bluff, a southern seaport town in New Zealand, to watch the great white shark, the largest predatory fish in the world. Working in what they call one of the five great white shark \"hotspots\" in the world, two researchers, India-based Raj Aich and his British associate, Soosie Lucas, are studying how cage diving impacts human interaction with the great white shark. Over the past year, the two have interviewed 150 cage divers - the youngest was 12 years old, and the oldest was 70 - from some 20 countries. \"Our research shows divers participating in the study return with a positive attitude towards the sharks after a cage dive,\" Dr Aich says. \"This helps them demystify the great white shark.\" The great white shark has suffered from a crippling image problem ever since the release more than 40 years ago of Steven Spielberg's Jaws, a horror blockbuster about a shark that repeatedly attacks beachgoers in a resort town in the US. \"It is as if God created the Devil and gave him jaws,\" a voice drones in the trailer about the film's subject, the most maligned of the 500-odd species of sharks. It is, the narrator says coldly, a \"mindless eating machine\" which \"lives to kill\". Since then generations have grown up with the image of a \"man-eater\" which glides from the sea floor to the surface, searching for human prey to catch and tear apart with its serrated teeth. Decades after Jaws, scary images and stereotypes about the shark are again being perpetuated in rating-thirsty TV shows. Two years ago, a video of a diver escaping an encounter with a great white that smashed through the bars of a diving cage off the coast of Mexico went viral and provoked scary headlines. So much so that the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red list has put the great white on its 'vulnerable' list because of this \"typically exaggerated threat to human safety and almost legendary 'Big Fish' status\". The species, according to IUCN, is targeted as a source of sports-fishing, hunting (for jaws, teeth and even entire specimens preserved), sporadic human consumption or merely as the piscine whipping-boy of individuals pandering to shark attack paranoia\". In real life, the great white shark - the fish can weigh up to two tonnes, grow to lengths of 20ft (6m), reach speeds of 40mph in water and live reasonably long - prefers seals, sea lions, tuna, salmon and small toothed whales as prey. \"They are inquisitive, sharp and sentient beings,\" Dr Aich says. \"Sometimes I go down in the water after baits have been thrown, and the shark doesn't come to the boat. Or she will come for a few seconds and go away. The shark's will to encounter humans is pivotal.\" The great white shark, according to shark specialist Craig Ferreira, is also \"capable of explosive violence, but is absolutely not a blood thirsty and aggressive animal, and its behaviour is centred on not becoming involved in conflict and combat, with combat being the last resort.\" Shark attacks have gone down over the years: there were 84 cases of unprovoked attacks on humans in 2016, according to the International Shark Attack File. Between 2011-2016, there were 82 such attacks annually. More than half of the unprovoked attacks took place in the Continental north American waters. Only 13 fatalities have been attributed to great white sharks in Western Australia since 1870, according to Leah Gibbs, a senior lecturer in geography at Australia's University of Wollongong. Every day, between December and June, two boats ferry hundreds of tourists who pay NZ$500 ($363;\u00a3262) each to climb into cages yoked to boats for a view of the undisputed 'king of the ocean' in 12-degree sea water. Attracted by tuna bait, the sharks swim to the turquoise blue waters where the Tasman Sea and the Southern Ocean meet. When the researchers spoke to cage divers near Bluff, many of them reported a \"great white epiphany\". 'Calm and peaceful'\nThey found the shark \"calm, peaceful and beautiful\" to look at. Others found it \"inquisitive and curious\". \"It comes and looks at the cage just to see what is going on,\" said one tourist. Watching the great white, according to a 60-year-old Canadian man, was a \"moving experience, and there was no fear at all\". \"People say all scary things about sharks, and as a child you are moulded into certain beliefs. But I felt totally at peace with those animals,\" he said. \"It's a completely different experience for me than that I've seen on TV,\" a honeymooning American couple told the researchers, \"It seems they are much more docile\". The jury is out on whether cage diving is a good way to improve interaction between humans and sharks. Ladling tuna bait in the water to attract the fish creates an \"unnatural situation, leading to unnatural behaviour by the sharks,\", George H Burgess, shark expert at the Florida Museum of Natural History, told me. In New Zealand's Stewart Island, the country's third-largest island and another popular shark diving destination, local fishermen have complained about sharks following and attacking boats. In Jaws, Matt Hooper, a character who plays an oceanographer and shark expert, tells the the chief of police investigating the beach deaths, \"There's nothing in the sea this fish would fear. Other fish run from bigger things. That's their instinct. But this fish doesn't run from anything. He doesn't fear.\" Not quite, as shark divers around the world are beginning to discover.

The artistic skill is in visualising such an image, and the photographic talent is in achieving it.\" Grant Thomas won the title of British Underwater Photographer of the Year. His image of swans, titled 'Love Birds', was taken in Scotland's Loch Lomond. Waiting in the waters of the lake, Thomas's patience paid off. \"The swans were searching for food.

        "content": "The Falcon Heavy's boosters burned for 154 seconds before they were jettisoned into space. Free from the main body of the rocket, they spun 180 degrees and arced back towards the earth, burning their engines again as they descended to Cape Canaveral, to land, smoothly, improbably upright, within a second of one other. Meanwhile, the main rocket pushed on, preparing to bring the world an even less credible sight. Four minutes into the flight, the nose cone broke apart to reveal its payload: a cherry-red electric sports car, with the top down, in space - a PR stunt for the ages. It was all brought to you by Elon Musk, the South African-born billionaire entrepreneur and founder of Paypal, electric car company Tesla, and SpaceX, the manufacturer of the Falcon Heavy. The partly-reusable Heavy is the most powerful rocket on earth, and, if Mr Musk is to be believed, a stepping stone to a rocket to Mars. The sports car in the nosecone was one of Mr Musk's own Tesla Roadsters. Its stereo was programmed to play David Bowie's Space Oddity on repeat as it travels for millions of years through space. Or until the battery dies, anyway. \"It's kind of silly and fun,\" he conceded, \"but silly and fun things are important.\" In the 12 years since Mr Musk sold online payments firm Paypal for $1.5bn, he has evolved in the public imagination into a kind of mad genius figure - part industrialist, part scientist, part playboy, part superhero. He has dated and married famous actresses, including Talulah Riley and Amber Heard, and had a rumoured fling with Cameron Diaz. Robert Downey Jr took inspiration from him to play Tony Stark in Iron Man. He has cornered private space flight and the electric car industry, ventured into solar energy and artificial intelligence, and promised super-high speed magnetic train travel, in a tube, underground. Oh, and he plans to colonise Mars. Most take Mr Musk's more wild ambitions and boasts with a galaxy-sized pinch of salt. His companies have missed deadline after deadline and recorded massive losses. But climate change campaigners have hailed the unexpected popularity of Tesla's electric cars, and the launch of the Falcon Heavy capped a string of successes for SpaceX. It all began in Pretoria, South Africa. As a young boy, he was obsessed with science fiction novels and more or less anything you could run a current through. His parents, Maye, a model, and Errol, an engineer, separated when he was eight. His younger brother and sister would stay with their mother, so he volunteered to go with their father. It did not go well. He later recalled returning home after vicious bullying at school, \"and it would just be awful there as well\". At 17, he moved to Canada to study physics and economics at Ontario's Queen's University. From Canada he migrated to the US in 1992, transferring to the University of Pennsylvania, and from Pennsylvania to a PhD in energy physics at Stanford in California, After two days, he quit. Instead he founded Zip2, an online newspaper platform, with his younger brother Kimbal. In 1999 they sold the company to Compaq for $300m, and Mr Musk ploughed his share into an online bank, X.com. X.com became Paypal, and in 2002 Paypal sold to eBay for $1.5bn. Aged 31, Mr Musk netted $165m. By that time, Mr Musk was two years into a marriage to Justine Wilson, an aspiring fantasy writer he met in Ontario. Mr Musk asked her out for ice cream. She agreed but then blew him off. He showed up in the student centre, where she was studying, with two cups of ice cream. \"He's not a man who takes no for an answer,\" Ms Wilson recalled in Marie Claire magazine. He is said to be a relentless worker. When he founded Zip2, he reportedly worked all day, slept in the office, and showered over the road at the YMCA. Asked in 2010 what advice he would give entrepreneurs, he suggested they should \"put in 80 to 100-hour weeks every week\". \"If other people are putting in 40-hour work weeks, and you're putting in 100-hour work weeks, you'll achieve in four months what takes them a year,\" he said. As they danced at their wedding, Justine later recalled, he told her: \"I am the alpha in this relationship\". He was a controlling husband, she said, pushing her to dye her hair more and more blonde. \"I am your wife,\" she recalled saying, \"not your employee.\" \"If you were my employee,\" he would reply, \"I would fire you.\" Their first son, Nevada, died at 10 weeks from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome - a tragedy that Mr Musk refused to talk about, she said. They went on to have five more children - twins and a set of triplets - via IVF, but she struggled with depression over the death of their first son. Eight years after they married, they divorced, in a messy, multi-million dollar separation. Six weeks later, he texted her to say he was engaged to Talulah Riley, a British actress 14 years his junior. \"I will never be happy without having someone,\" he told Rolling Stone. \"Going to sleep alone kills me.\" He and Ms Riley married in 2010. They divorced in 2012 and remarried in 2013. In 2014 he filed for, then withdrew, a second divorce and in 2016 she filed for divorce and it took. After the sale of Paypal in 2002, Mr Musk ploughed his $165m into three new companies: Tesla, SpaceX, and a solar energy company called Solar City. Tesla was a quixotic venture, a niche electric car company in a nation addicted to gas. With Mr Musk as CEO, the company set out a top-down plan - first, market a high-performance sports car, a machine that would set Tesla apart from a stereotype of small, underpowered electric vehicles. Then a luxury sedan, and finally a low-cost, mass-market electric car. A $456m loan from the US government saved Tesla from near-bankruptcy in 2008, and in 2010 it became the first American car company to float on the stock market since Ford in 1956. In 2017, it surpassed Ford and General Motors to become, briefly, the most valuable car company in the country. It was the market betting on a greener future, and not a reflection of Tesla's bottom line. Serious production delays on its low-cost Model 3 have compounded years of losses. On Wednesday, the day after its Roadster went interstellar, Tesla Inc landed with a bump. It reported a $675.4m (\u00a3487m) loss in the last quarter of 2017, more than five times worse than the previous year, although revenue climbed 44% to $3.3 billion. \"We were in a deeper level of hell than we expected, still a few levels deeper than we would like to be,\" said Mr Musk on a conference call with analysts. It was a characteristic take for a man preoccupied with human extinction. A few hours earlier, he had announced on Twitter that the company's cosmic Roadster was en route to the asteroid belt, having overshot the trajectory for its planned Mars orbit. Then astronomers took a closer look at the data and concluded the car wouldn't make it that far. Not for the first time, SpaceX revised its projections. Over the past five or so years, Mr Musk has outlined varying plans and deadlines for his ultimate goal of sending humans to colonise the Red Planet. Late last year, he said he expected SpaceX to send a cargo mission in 2022, to lay groundwork, followed by a manned mission in 2024. The practical difficulties and dangers of sending humans 140 million miles to Mars are huge. Nasa has been more circumspect, putting its estimate for a manned mission somewhere in the mid-2030s. But the successes of SpaceX's more prosaic work - resupply missions to the space station, commercial satellite launches, Nasa and Air Force contracts - have propelled it to near the top of the list of the world's most valuable privately-held companies, with a $21.2bn valuation. The company has pioneered new reusable rocket technology, wowing the world, as on Tuesday, with the sight of pencil-like rockets gracefully descending to land with pinpoint accuracy, on land and at sea. It has undercut Nasa and major established rivals such as Boeing to provide (relatively) cheap space flight. And as SpaceX looks to the heavens, another of Mr Musk's companies is going underground. In October, the Boring Company won permission from the US government to dig a 10-mile test tunnel under Maryland. Mr Musk hopes it will one day house the \"Hyperloop\", an electromagnetic bullet train he has boasted will carry passengers at up to 760mph (1223km/h). In July, he tweeted that he had won \"verbal government approval\" to build a Hyperloop between New York and DC that would reduce the journey time from three hours to 29 minutes. Officials said no such approval had been given. The Hyperloop idea has its fair share of critics. Thom Neff, a civil engineer, put it succinctly when he told Wired last year, \"I would put what Mr Musk is saying today in the bullshit category.\" A working Hyperloop is, without doubt, a long way off. But to those who admire him, Mr Musk is a visionary, an irrepressible Howard Hughes-like figure revolutionising industry after industry. His two latest ventures, Neuralink and OpenAI, take him into the world of artificial intelligence. His madcap ideas to save humanity from itself have even earned him the honour of a parody Twitter account, \"Bored Elon Musk\". On Tuesday, after one of Mr Musk's companies blasted a sports car into space and another reported record losses, his bored alter-ego put out a single tweet. \"Classic Tuesday,\" it said. ",

        "content": "Donald Trump has reacted cautiously to news that North Korea is willing to talk about giving up its nuclear weapons if it did not feel threatened. The US president said \"the statements coming out of South Korea and North Korea have been very positive\", but also said it might be a \"false hope\". South Korea earlier said the subject was raised when its officials met the North's leader, Kim Jong-un, on Monday. Seoul said Mr Kim was also open to US talks, and would pause weapons testing. However previous talks with North Korea have come to nothing, and some US and South Korean officials have suggested the North may be trying to buy time to develop weapons programmes, and to seek relief from biting sanctions. There has also been no immediate comment from Pyongyang itself. Further news that the leaders of North and South Korea have also agreed to meet at a summit next month, came via the leader of the South's delegation, Chung Eui-yong. It would be the first such meeting for more than a decade and the first since Kim Jong-un took power in North Korea. North Korea crisis in 300 words What did President Trump say?\nSpeaking to reporters at Washington's Oval Office, he said: \"We have come certainly a long way, at least rhetorically, with North Korea. \"The statements coming out of South Korea and North Korea have been very positive. That would be a great thing for the world.\" The US leader also praised Pyongyang for its decision to take part in the Pyeongchang Olympics in South Korea. But he earlier posted a cautious tweet, warning about a \"false hope\". Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction! End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump Meanwhile, US Vice-President Mike Pence said: \"Whichever direction talks with North Korea go, we will be firm in our resolve. \"The United States and our allies remain committed to applying maximum pressure on the Kim regime to end their nuclear program. \"All options are on the table and our posture toward the regime will not change until we see credible, verifiable, and concrete steps toward denuclearisation.\" Lt Gen Robert Ashley, who heads the US Defense Intelligence Agency, said he did not share optimism voiced in America, adding that \"we'll see how this plays out\". The US has maintained that North Korean gestures of rapprochement would carry little weight without a commitment on nuclear weapons - particularly following last year's nuclear and missile tests carried out by the North. The South Korean delegation is expected to visit Washington later this week to brief US officials on their talks in the North. Meanwhile, China's foreign ministry said it hoped the Koreas could continue with efforts to advance reconciliation, Reuters news agency reported. What is North Korea reported to have said?\nA statement from the South Korea president's office issued earlier on Tuesday said: \"The North showed willingness on denuclearisation in the Korean Peninsula. If military threats to the North Korea decrease and regime safety is guaranteed, the North showed that it has no reason to retain nukes.\" The North's KCNA news agency said Mr Kim had \"warmly welcomed\" the delegates and held an \"openhearted talk\" with them. It said the dinner took place \"in a warm atmosphere overflowing with compatriotic feelings\". However, some critics have suspicions over North Korea's intentions. In the past, they have failed to follow through on deals, notably an aid-for-disarmament agreement in 2005. What happened at the Pyongyang dinner?\nSouth Korean officials had a four-hour dinner with Kim Jong-un on Monday. Among the delegation were intelligence chief Suh Hoon and National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong. Pictures showed Mr Kim and visitors from the South smiling broadly around a dinner table. Also present was Mr Kim's wife, Ri Sol-ju, who rarely appears at official events, and his sister Kim Yo-jong, who was part of a North Korean delegation to the Pyeongchang Olympics. The two sides appear to be aiming to capitalise on the reduced tensions after the Games, which saw the Koreas march together under one flag. During their visit, the South's officials also held a boardroom meeting and passed on a letter from South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in which he invited Mr Kim to attend further talks. KCNA said Mr Kim had \"exchanged views and made a satisfactory agreement\" on the letter and gave orders for it to be acted on. The South's delegates returned to Seoul on Tuesday morning, the South Korean news agency Yonhap said. Has this ever happened before?\nThese were the first officials from Seoul to meet Mr Kim since he came to power. Kim Jong-un has met very few foreign officials since he became leader in 2011 and the last time envoys from the South visited Pyongyang was in 2007. Two previous summits were held in 2000 and 2007, under South Korean presidents Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun who met Kim's father, Kim Jong-il. The South's officials have stressed the talks were only preliminary, but the parties had \"somewhat shared\" views on some issues. ",

        "content": "The UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian involvement in the collapse of former spy Sergei Skripal, Boris Johnson has said. Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are critically ill in hospital after being found unconscious in Salisbury, Wiltshire. The foreign secretary said he was not pointing fingers at this stage, but described Russia as \"a malign and disruptive force\". Russia has denied any involvement. Counter Terrorism Police have taken over the investigation from Wiltshire Police. But in a statement, the unit said the inquiry had not been declared a terrorist incident and there was no risk to the wider public. Family deaths\nRelatives of Mr Skripal - a former Russian colonel convicted of spying for Britain - have told the BBC Russian Service that he believed the Russian special services might come after him at any time. His wife, elder brother and his son have died in the past two years, some in mysterious circumstances, the family believe. Ms Skripal lives in Moscow and has visited her father in the UK regularly, especially over the past two years. Mr Skripal and his daughter were found slumped and unconscious on a bench outside a shopping centre on Sunday afternoon. CCTV footage has been released by police which appears to show the pair walking through an alleyway near a Zizzi restaurant shortly before they collapsed. Police have since sealed off the restaurant and The Bishop's Mill pub was also cordoned off as a precaution. On Tuesday evening, police extended the cordon and shut off a bridge. Two police officers caught up in the suspected contamination have been treated in hospital for minor symptoms, before they were given the all clear. It is understood their symptoms included itchy eyes and wheezing. A third member of the emergency services remains in hospital. Scientists at Porton Down - the UK's secret weapons research facility in Wiltshire - are studying the \"unknown substance\". Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, Mr Johnson said: \"Honourable members will note the echoes of the death of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006. \"I say to governments around the world that no attempt to take innocent life on UK soil will go unsanctioned or unpunished.\" Mr Johnson said the UK was \"in the lead across the world\" in trying to counteract a \"host of malign activity\" by Russia. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, but says it is open to co-operating with British police if requested. In a statement, the Russian embassy in London said: \"Media reports create an impression of a planned operation by the Russian special services, which is completely untrue.\" Responding to Mr Johnson's comments, the embassy added: \"Looks like the script of yet another anti-Russian campaign has been already written.\" Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI as part of a swap. He was later flown to the UK. According to BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban, in recent years Col Skripal gave lectures at military academies offering insight into Russia's foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU. Read more about Sergei Skripal's background here. Putin, power and poison: Russia\u2019s elite FSB spy club BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban said Boris Johnson's strongly-worded statement indicates that the Government is \"party to some kind of intelligence\". \"It's evident from the foreign secretary's statement, and certainly the view in Whitehall is, he would not have gone this far unless the government was party to some kind of intelligence about what had gone on,\" Urban said. The possibility of an unexplained substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko. The Russian dissident and former intelligence officer died in London after drinking tea laced with a radioactive substance. A public inquiry concluded that his killing had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Andrei Lugovoi, the former Russian agent accused of poisoning Litvinenko, told the BBC that Russia would have considered the matter closed when Mr Skripal was flown to the UK as part of a spy swap in 2010. Mr Skripal was pardoned by the Russian President and so the incident was over, Mr Lugovoi said. Igor Sutyagin, who was one of four agents released by Moscow in the exchange, is now a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). He told the BBC's World Tonight programme that he was not yet concerned for his safety and added: \"I don't think that he (Mr Skripal) would be targeted, because he was pardoned.\" But Mr Litvinenko's widow, Marina Litvinenko, told the programme that the latest incident felt like \"deja vu\" - and called for those receiving political asylum to be protected by the UK. Meanwhile, the Home Affairs Committee has asked for a review into 14 deaths that have not been treated as suspicious by British police but have reportedly been identified as potentially linked to Russia. Analysis\nBy Norman Smith, BBC assistant political editor Although Boris Johnson was careful to stress this was still an ongoing investigation - it's absolutely clear he, and others in government, believe it's highly likely this was a Russian state-sponsored attack. The big question now - how does the government respond? A question made more pressing by accusations that ministers were guilty of appeasement in the wake of Alexander Litvinenko's killing. Mr Johnson suggested there could be targeted sanctions against those close to President Putin. And, perhaps most significantly, in an indication the government could seek to rally international support to make a stand against Russia, Mr Johnson said there could be a co-ordinated response with Nato allies. Whatever measures are eventually decided upon - if Russian involvement is proven - it's clear relations between London and Moscow have plunged to new depths.

        "content": "US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has criticised China's economic engagement in Africa, ahead of his first official visit to the continent. He said China encouraged dependency, utilised corrupt deals and endangered its natural resources. Mr Tillerson also announced a $533m (\u00a3380m) humanitarian African aid plan. During his trip, he will be looking to build bridges after President Donald Trump reportedly used foul language to describe African countries in January. Mr Tillerson gave his speech at George Mason University in Virginia, shortly before setting off on his weeklong visit to Chad, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and Nigeria. He outlined the themes of his trip: counterterrorism, democracy, governance, trade and investment. Then he launched into his criticism of China. He said its investment had the potential to improve Africa's infrastructure, but added that its approach had led to mounting debt while creating few jobs. Over the past two decades trade between Africa and China has soared, driven by China's demand for the continent's minerals. However, Chinese construction firms have made significant improvements to long-neglected infrastructure, including roads, in a number of countries. \"Our country's security and economic prosperity are linked with Africa's like never before,\" said Mr Tillerson He said the aid plan will help people affected by food shortages and conflict in Somalia, South Sudan, Ethiopia and the Lake Chad Basin. Mr Tillerson said he has made many trips to Africa before, in his former career as an oil executive. His latest, and his first as the US's top diplomat, coincides with that of his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, who is this week visiting Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe. Aid on one side, cuts on the other\nBy Fergal Keane, BBC Africa editor Rex Tillerson's essential message was that was a true friend to Africa... unlike China. The US would do more to reduce trade and investment barriers for African partners, he said. His announcement of more humanitarian assistance for several countries threatened by famine will be welcomed, but Mr Tillerson works for a president who has repeatedly spoken of reducing America's burdens abroad. His remarks come against the backdrop of potentially sweeping cuts to American contributions to peacekeeping and aid operations - at a time when crises in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic and South Sudan, among others have placed immense strain on existing UN operations. In an administration that has often struggled for coherence in its foreign policy, and which lives by the maxim of America First, it would be unrealistic to expect Secretary Tillerson to deliver a transformation in the relationship between US and Africa.

        "content": "European champions Real Madrid moved into the Champions League quarter-finals as they beat Ligue 1 leaders Paris St-Germain at Parc des Princes. Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice in the first leg at home, which Real won 3-1, and he headed in from Lucas Vazquez's cross to extend Real's lead in France. PSG had midfielder Marco Verratti sent off for two bookable offences, before Edinson Cavani pulled a goal back. But Casemiro's heavily deflected strike sealed Real's victory. For PSG, 14 points clear at the top of Ligue 1, it is the second successive season where they have gone out at the last-16 phase. They were without injured forward Neymar and were not helped by Verratti's needless dismissal in the 66th minute. He was booked when he fouled Casemiro in the first half and was shown a second yellow card when he sprinted after referee Felix Brych and was cautioned for dissent. Real are now into the Champions League quarter-finals for an eighth successive season and remain on course for a third title in a row. More to follow.

        "content": "Liverpool are through to the quarter-finals of the Champions League for the first time since 2009 after a 0-0 second-leg draw at Anfield gave them a 5-0 aggregate win over Porto in their last-16 tie. Sadio Mane acrobatically fired an effort over the bar and hit the post in a generally tame first half that also saw Dejan Lovren head narrowly wide. Majeed Waris' strike in the second half was Porto's only shot on target. The Reds took a 5-0 lead into the game. It was always likely this might be a quiet affair with Liverpool having already done the damage in Portugal on Valentines Day. Jurgen Klopp used the opportunity to rest players for Liverpool's Premier League match against Manchester United on Saturday (12:30 GMT), making five changes to the starting line-up. Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah were named among the substitutes but the Egyptian did have a cameo in the second half as Mane was given a breather. There was also a chance for Joe Gomez and Adam Lallana to gain further fitness following returns from injury - while Danny Ings enjoyed some rare game-time as a second-half substitute. Liverpool will discover their quarter-final opponents when the draw is made on 16 March (11:00 GMT). The ties will be played in the first and second weeks of April. It is almost 11 years since Liverpool faced AC Milan in the Champions League final, losing 2-1 in Athens. Back then they were hitting the heights in European football pretty regularly - the most successful English club in the competition's history, it was just two years since they had beaten the same opponents to lift their fifth trophy on a famous night in Istanbul. But since being knocked out at the group stage in 2009, Liverpool have only featured in the Champions League twice. It was a dejected-looking Reds side who trudged off the field in December 2014, a 1-1 draw with Basel confirming their elimination from the competition after a wretched campaign. It would be Steven Gerrard's last game in the Champions League - a Liverpool legend bowing out with a goal but unable to reproduce the heroics he had done against Olympiakos a decade before en route to Istanbul. After five years of waiting, it wasn't the way Liverpool had dreamt their comeback would go. Four more years on, Liverpool are back. And this time they look more than worthy members of Europe's elite. They have cantered into the quarter-finals - barely hitting second gear - and now they eye the prize of a place in the last four. Porto goalkeeper Iker Casillas may have played his final Champions League game tonight - if so, he leaves the competition with a record number of appearances. The 36-year-old, who played his 167th game on Tuesday, is expected to leave Porto at the end of the season and it is unclear where his future lies. But this was not the fairytale ending the three-time European champion might have hoped for. Despite a decent save from Ings late in the second half, it was largely a forgettable evening. Liverpool prepare for a blockbuster fixture on Saturday as they travel to Old Trafford to take on Premier League rivals Manchester United (12:30 GMT) with second place in the table up for grabs.

        "content": "The UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian involvement in the collapse of former spy Sergei Skripal, Boris Johnson has said. Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are critically ill in hospital after being found unconscious in Salisbury, Wiltshire. The foreign secretary said he was not pointing fingers at this stage, but described Russia as \"a malign and disruptive force\". Russia has denied any involvement. Downing Street said Home Secretary Amber Rudd will chair a meeting of Cobra, the government's emergency committee, on Wednesday to discuss the Salisbury investigation. Counter Terrorism Police have taken over the investigation from Wiltshire Police. But in a statement, the unit said the inquiry had not been declared a terrorist incident and there was no risk to the wider public. Family deaths\nRelatives of Mr Skripal - a former Russian colonel convicted of spying for Britain - have told the BBC Russian Service that he believed the Russian special services might come after him at any time. His wife, elder brother and his son have died in the past two years, some in mysterious circumstances, the family believe. Ms Skripal lives in Moscow and has visited her father in the UK regularly, especially over the past two years. Mr Skripal and his daughter were found slumped and unconscious on a bench outside a shopping centre on Sunday afternoon. CCTV footage has been released by police which appears to show the pair walking through an alleyway near a Zizzi restaurant shortly before they collapsed. Police have since sealed off the restaurant and The Bishop's Mill pub was also cordoned off as a precaution. On Tuesday evening, police extended the cordon and shut off a bridge. Two police officers caught up in the suspected contamination have been treated in hospital for minor symptoms, before they were given the all clear. It is understood their symptoms included itchy eyes and wheezing. A third member of the emergency services remains in hospital. Scientists at Porton Down - the UK's secret weapons research facility in Wiltshire - are studying the \"unknown substance\". Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, Mr Johnson said: \"Honourable members will note the echoes of the death of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006. \"I say to governments around the world that no attempt to take innocent life on UK soil will go unsanctioned or unpunished.\" Mr Johnson said the UK was \"in the lead across the world\" in trying to counteract a \"host of malign activity\" by Russia. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, but says it is open to co-operating with British police if requested. In a statement, the Russian embassy in London said: \"Media reports create an impression of a planned operation by the Russian special services, which is completely untrue.\" Responding to Mr Johnson's comments, the embassy added: \"Looks like the script of yet another anti-Russian campaign has been already written.\" Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI as part of a swap. He was later flown to the UK. According to BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban, in recent years Col Skripal gave lectures at military academies offering insight into Russia's foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU. Read more about Sergei Skripal's background here. Putin, power and poison: Russia\u2019s elite FSB spy club BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban said Boris Johnson's strongly-worded statement indicates that the Government is \"party to some kind of intelligence\". \"It's evident from the foreign secretary's statement, and certainly the view in Whitehall is, he would not have gone this far unless the government was party to some kind of intelligence about what had gone on,\" Urban said. The possibility of an unexplained substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko. The Russian dissident and former intelligence officer died in London after drinking tea laced with a radioactive substance. A public inquiry concluded that his killing had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Andrei Lugovoi, the former Russian agent accused of poisoning Litvinenko but who denies the claims, told the BBC that Russia would have considered the matter closed when Mr Skripal was flown to the UK as part of a spy swap in 2010. Mr Skripal was pardoned by the Russian President and so the incident was over, Mr Lugovoi said. Igor Sutyagin, who was one of four agents released by Moscow in the exchange, is now a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). He told the BBC's World Tonight programme that he was not yet concerned for his safety and added: \"I don't think that he (Mr Skripal) would be targeted, because he was pardoned.\" But Mr Litvinenko's widow, Marina Litvinenko, told the programme that the latest incident felt like \"deja vu\" - and called for those receiving political asylum to be protected by the UK. Meanwhile, the Home Affairs Committee has asked for a review into 14 deaths that have not been treated as suspicious by British police but have reportedly been identified as potentially linked to Russia. The reaction in Russia\nBy BBC Monitoring Russian state TV's coverage of the possible poisoning in the UK of former agent Sergei Skripal has been eccentric, to say the least. State TV remains the main source of news for most Russians. The main official TV channel Rossiya 1 covered the story early in the day, but studiously ignored any comparison with the poisoning in 2006 of former Russian FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko, which has been a prominent feature of reports in the UK media. This evening, the main primetime bulletin on Rossiya 1 and the two other main Russian TV stations, Channel One and NTV, did not touch the story. The oddities in the coverage did not stop there, though. On Rossiya 24, the country's main news channel and the sister channel to Rossiya 1, the Skripal case was the main story this evening, with a report accusing the UK authorities and media of conspiring to blacken Russia's name. The presenter described the case as a \"new classic in British conspirology\" The popular tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda described the poisoning as \"another scandal with a dash of Russophobia\". Russian news agencies reported the indignation expressed by officials as they criticised Boris Johnson's warning to Russia. \"The demonisation of Russia\", said a Russian embassy press release. \"This is preposterous,\" the Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova was quoted as telling Interfax news agency. Mr Johnson's comments are \"unacceptable and in \"extremely bad faith,\" said Konstantin Kosachyov, head of the International Affairs Committee of the Federation Council upper house of parliament. Analysis\nBy Norman Smith, BBC assistant political editor Although Boris Johnson was careful to stress this was still an ongoing investigation - it's absolutely clear he, and others in government, believe it's highly likely this was a Russian state-sponsored attack. The big question now - how does the government respond? A question made more pressing by accusations that ministers were guilty of appeasement in the wake of Alexander Litvinenko's killing. Mr Johnson suggested there could be targeted sanctions against those close to President Putin. And, perhaps most significantly, in an indication the government could seek to rally international support to make a stand against Russia, Mr Johnson said there could be a co-ordinated response with Nato allies. Whatever measures are eventually decided upon - if Russian involvement is proven - it's clear relations between London and Moscow have plunged to new depths.

Defending his tariff plans as he hosted the Swedish PM at the White House, Mr Trump said other countries had \"taken advantage of\" the US for decades. His guest, Stefan Lofven, said: \"I am convinced that increased tariffs will hurt us all in the long run.\" The EU has drawn up a $3.5bn (\u00a32.5bn) hit list of retaliatory tariffs. Motorbikes, whiskey and T-shirts are on the bloc's list of 100 American products, the BBC understands. Bikes, bourbon and T-shirts on EU tax list The US president's proposed global duties on steel and aluminium have raised the prospect of a tit-for-tat trade war. \"The European Union has been particularly tough on the United States,\" Mr Trump said at Tuesday's joint press conference with the Swedish prime minister. \"They make it almost impossible for us to do business with them,\" Mr Trump complained. Mr Trump said if the EU retaliated, the US would impose a 25% tax on European cars. But the US president also said America would levy tariffs in a \"loving, loving way\". \"They'll like us better and they'll respect us more,\" he said about US trade partners who object to the plan. Mr Trump repeated his belief that the US would win any trade war, since it was running such a large trade deficit. \"When we're behind on every single country, trade wars aren't so bad,\" he told reporters at the White House. Mr Trump's decision to raise import taxes on steel to 25% and aluminium to 10% prompted strong reactions around the world last week. Mr Lofven, who is the first European leader to visit the White House since the tariffs were announced last week, said: \"I, of course, support the efforts of the European Union to achieve trade with fewer obstacles.\" More on Trump tariffs\nEU eyes tax on Levis amid US trade row Four reasons Trump is hanging tough on trade ",

        "content": "Donald Trump has reacted cautiously to news that North Korea is willing to talk about giving up its nuclear weapons if it did not feel threatened. The US president said \"the statements coming out of South Korea and North Korea have been very positive\", but also said it might be a \"false hope\". South Korea earlier said the subject was raised when its officials met the North's leader, Kim Jong-un, on Monday. Seoul said Mr Kim was also open to US talks, and would pause weapons testing. However previous talks with North Korea have come to nothing, and some US and South Korean officials have suggested the North may be trying to buy time to develop weapons programmes, and to seek relief from biting sanctions. There has also been no immediate comment from Pyongyang itself. Further news that the leaders of North and South Korea have also agreed to meet at a summit next month, came via the leader of the South's delegation, Chung Eui-yong. It would be the first such meeting for more than a decade and the first since Kim Jong-un took power in North Korea in 2011. North Korea crisis in 300 words What did President Trump say?\n\"We have come certainly a long way, at least rhetorically, with North Korea,\" Mr Trump said. \"The statements coming out of South Korea and North Korea have been very positive. That would be a great thing for the world.\" The US leader also praised Pyongyang for its decision to take part in the Pyeongchang Olympics in South Korea. But he earlier posted a cautious tweet, warning about a \"false hope\". Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction! End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump While the US president said he believed Pyongyang's offer to hold denuclearization talks was \"sincere\" he said it was \"also because of the sanctions and what we're doing with respect to North Korea.\" Meanwhile, US Vice-President Mike Pence said the US remained \"committed to applying maximum pressure on the Kim regime to end their nuclear program\". All options were on the table, he said, and US posture towards the regime would not not change \"until we see credible, verifiable, and concrete steps toward denuclearisation\". The US has maintained that North Korean gestures of rapprochement would carry little weight without a commitment on nuclear weapons - particularly following last year's nuclear and missile tests carried out by the North. The South Korean delegation is expected to visit Washington later this week to brief US officials on their talks in the North. What is North Korea reported to have said?\nA statement from the South Korea president's office issued earlier on Tuesday said: \"The North showed willingness on denuclearisation in the Korean Peninsula. If military threats to the North Korea decrease and regime safety is guaranteed, the North showed that it has no reason to retain nukes.\" The North's KCNA news agency said Mr Kim had \"warmly welcomed\" the delegates and held an \"openhearted talk\" with them. It said the dinner took place \"in a warm atmosphere overflowing with compatriotic feelings\". However, some critics have suspicions over North Korea's intentions. In the past, they have failed to follow through on deals, notably an aid-for-disarmament agreement in 2005. What happened at the Pyongyang dinner?\nSouth Korean officials had a four-hour dinner with Kim Jong-un on Monday. Among the delegation were intelligence chief Suh Hoon and National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong. Pictures showed Mr Kim and visitors from the South smiling broadly around a dinner table. Also present was Mr Kim's wife, Ri Sol-ju, who rarely appears at official events, and his sister Kim Yo-jong, who was part of a North Korean delegation to the Pyeongchang Olympics. The two sides appear to be aiming to capitalise on the reduced tensions after the Games, which saw the Koreas march together under one flag. During their visit, the South's officials also held a boardroom meeting and passed on a letter from South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in which he invited Mr Kim to attend further talks. KCNA said Mr Kim had \"exchanged views and made a satisfactory agreement\" on the letter and gave orders for it to be acted on. History of broken promises\nA series of six-party talks have been held since North Korea decided to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 2003. But attempts to negotiate aid-for-disarmament deals have repeatedly failed so far. In 2009, North Korea pulled out of the talks and expelled all nuclear inspectors from the country, in response to UN Security Council criticism of a rocket launch. Pyongyang also vowed to resume its nuclear activities. A number of bids to restart the talks collapsed, including in 2012 when North Korea launched another rocket, two weeks after announcing a \"leap day\" agreement with the US. The North said it was commemorating the birth of its founding father, with a new satellite, but it was condemned by others as a provocative test of missile technology. Throughout 2017 Mr Kim ordered a series of incendiary ballistic missile tests, significantly raising the stakes. In response the UN implemented increasingly tough sanctions. Even China, the North's only real ally, has added to the economic and diplomatic pressure. ",

        "content": "A Spanish tourist has died after a suspected carbon monoxide leak in a west London hotel. The Mayflower Hotel in Kensington was evacuated after emergency services were called at about 13:50 GMT on Monday. One man was pronounced dead at the scene. Another Spanish man in his 30s, thought to have been staying in the same room, is in a critical condition in hospital. Scotland Yard said initial carbon monoxide tests showed high readings. Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus carried out a sweep of the hotel to check levels of the deadly gas, the London Fire Brigade said. A spokesman added: \"Crews isolated the gas supply and ventilated the building.\" 'Unexplained'\nPolice said initial tests found the readings were high, although the investigation run by police and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea's environmental health department has not yet concluded. Some 29 people were evacuated from the hotel, which remains closed although the scene is now safe, police added. A spokesman from Spain's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said its London consulate is helping the victims' families. Scotland Yard said a post-mortem examination is yet to be held and the death is being treated as \"unexplained\". The hotel did not respond to a request for comment. ",

        "content": "Liverpool are through to the quarter-finals of the Champions League for the first time since 2009 after a 0-0 second-leg draw at Anfield gave them a 5-0 aggregate win over Porto in their last-16 tie. Sadio Mane acrobatically fired an effort over the bar and hit the post in a generally tame first half that also saw Dejan Lovren head narrowly wide. Majeed Waris' strike in the second half was Porto's only shot on target. The Reds took a 5-0 lead into the game. It was always likely this might be a quiet affair with Liverpool having already done the damage in Portugal on Valentines Day. Jurgen Klopp used the opportunity to rest players for Liverpool's Premier League match against Manchester United on Saturday (12:30 GMT), making five changes to the starting line-up. Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah were named among the substitutes but the Egyptian did have a cameo in the second half as Mane was given a breather. There was also a chance for Joe Gomez and Adam Lallana to gain further fitness following returns from injury - while Danny Ings enjoyed some rare game-time as a second-half substitute. Liverpool will discover their quarter-final opponents when the draw is made on 16 March (11:00 GMT). The ties will be played in the first and second weeks of April. It is almost 11 years since Liverpool faced AC Milan in the Champions League final, losing 2-1 in Athens. Back then they were hitting the heights in European football pretty regularly - the most successful English club in the competition's history, it was just two years since they had beaten the same opponents to lift their fifth trophy on a famous night in Istanbul. But since being knocked out at the group stage in 2009, Liverpool have only featured in the Champions League twice. It was a dejected-looking Reds side who trudged off the field in December 2014, a 1-1 draw with Basel confirming their elimination from the competition after a wretched campaign. It would be Steven Gerrard's last game in the Champions League - a Liverpool legend bowing out with a goal but unable to reproduce the heroics he had done against Olympiakos a decade before en route to Istanbul. After five years of waiting, it wasn't the way Liverpool had dreamt their comeback would go. Four more years on, Liverpool are back. And this time they look more than worthy members of Europe's elite. They have cantered into the quarter-finals - barely hitting second gear - and now they eye the prize of a place in the last four. Porto goalkeeper Iker Casillas may have played his final Champions League game tonight - if so, he leaves the competition with a record number of appearances. The 36-year-old, who played his 167th game on Tuesday, is expected to leave Porto at the end of the season and it is unclear where his future lies. But this was not the fairytale ending the three-time European champion might have hoped for. Despite a decent save from Ings late in the second half, it was largely a forgettable evening. Liverpool prepare for a blockbuster fixture on Saturday as they travel to Old Trafford to take on Premier League rivals Manchester United (12:30 GMT) with second place in the table up for grabs.

        "content": "European champions Real Madrid moved into the Champions League quarter-finals as they beat Ligue 1 leaders Paris St-Germain at Parc des Princes. Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice in the first leg at home, which Real won 3-1, and he headed in from Lucas Vazquez's cross to extend Real's lead in France. PSG had midfielder Marco Verratti sent off for two bookable offences, before Edinson Cavani pulled a goal back. But Casemiro's heavily deflected strike sealed Real's victory. For PSG, 14 points clear at the top of Ligue 1, it is the second successive season where they have gone out at the last-16 phase. They were without injured forward Neymar and were not helped by Verratti's needless dismissal in the 66th minute. He was booked when he fouled Casemiro in the first half and was shown a second yellow card when he sprinted after referee Felix Brych and was cautioned for dissent. Real are now into the Champions League quarter-finals for an eighth successive season and remain on course for a third title in a row. Real won the Spanish Supercup in August and the Fifa Club World Cup in December, but manager Zinedine Zidane has come under increasing pressure with the club struggling in La Liga. They are in third place in the Spanish top flight, 15 points behind leaders Barcelona. However, Zidane got his tactics spot on against PSG, leaving Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and Gareth Bale on the bench as he looked to hit the hosts on the counter-attack, with Vazquez and Marco Asensio occupying the wide midfield roles. PSG had scored 86 goals in 28 Ligue 1 matches and also netted 25 times in their six Champions League group games, but were restricted to only three shots on target in this second leg, which was played in a fantastic atmosphere in Paris. Ronaldo netted his 12th goal in this season's Champions League when Real pounced on a Dani Alves error and the Portugal forward converted with a powerful header from six yards out after Vasquez's fine cross. Cavani scored a fortunate equaliser when a clearance rebounded off him into the net, but Casemiro's strike went in off PSG defender Marquinhos as Real made sure of their passage into the next round. It could have been even worse for PSG as Real also hit the woodwork twice, through Asensio and Vasquez, who collected a pull-back from substitute Bale, but struck the foot of the post. Pat Nevin, BBC Radio 5 live pundit Having not been considered this season, Real Madrid now need to be considered as contenders. Real Madrid deserved to win the game, a really good performance. PSG had to be at their very best, but they were not. I am not sure Real Madrid were at their best, but they were 10 times better than they were against Tottenham (when they lost 3-1 at Wembley in the group stage in November). More to follow.

Defending his tariff plans as he hosted the Swedish PM at the White House, Mr Trump said other countries had \"taken advantage of\" the US for decades. His guest, Stefan Lofven, said: \"I am convinced that increased tariffs will hurt us all in the long run.\" The EU has drawn up a $3.5bn (\u00a32.5bn) hit list of retaliatory tariffs. Motorbikes, whiskey and T-shirts are on the bloc's list of 100 American products, the BBC understands. Bikes, bourbon and T-shirts on EU tax list The US president's proposed global duties on steel and aluminium have raised the prospect of a tit-for-tat trade war. \"The European Union has been particularly tough on the United States,\" Mr Trump said at Tuesday's joint press conference with the Swedish prime minister. \"They make it almost impossible for us to do business with them,\" Mr Trump complained. Mr Trump said if the EU retaliated, the US would impose a 25% tax on European cars. But the US president also said America would levy tariffs in a \"loving, loving way\". \"They'll like us better and they'll respect us more,\" he said about US trade partners who object to the plan. Mr Trump repeated his belief that the US would win any trade war, since it was running such a large trade deficit. \"When we're behind on every single country, trade wars aren't so bad,\" he told reporters at the White House. Mr Trump's decision to raise import taxes on steel to 25% and aluminium to 10% prompted strong reactions around the world last week. Mr Lofven, who is the first European leader to visit the White House since the tariffs were announced last week, said: \"I, of course, support the efforts of the European Union to achieve trade with fewer obstacles.\" More on Trump tariffs\nEU eyes tax on Levis amid US trade row Four reasons Trump is hanging tough on trade ",

        "content": "Liverpool are through to the quarter-finals of the Champions League for the first time since 2009 after a 0-0 second-leg draw at Anfield gave them a 5-0 aggregate win over Porto in their last-16 tie. Sadio Mane acrobatically fired an effort over the bar and hit the post in a generally tame first half that also saw Dejan Lovren head narrowly wide. Majeed Waris' strike in the second half was Porto's only shot on target. The Reds took a 5-0 lead into the game. It was always likely this might be a quiet affair with Liverpool having already done the damage in Portugal on Valentines Day. Jurgen Klopp used the opportunity to rest players for Liverpool's Premier League match against Manchester United on Saturday (12:30 GMT), making five changes to the starting line-up. Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah were named among the substitutes but the Egyptian did have a cameo in the second half as Mane was given a breather. There was also a chance for Joe Gomez and Adam Lallana to gain further fitness following returns from injury - while Danny Ings enjoyed some rare game-time as a second-half substitute. Liverpool will discover their quarter-final opponents when the draw is made on 16 March (11:00 GMT). The ties will be played in the first and second weeks of April. It is almost 11 years since Liverpool faced AC Milan in the Champions League final, losing 2-1 in Athens. Back then they were hitting the heights in European football pretty regularly - the most successful English club in the competition's history, it was just two years since they had beaten the same opponents to lift their fifth trophy on a famous night in Istanbul. But since being knocked out at the group stage in 2009, Liverpool have only featured in the Champions League twice. It was a dejected-looking Reds side who trudged off the field in December 2014, a 1-1 draw with Basel confirming their elimination from the competition after a wretched campaign. It would be Steven Gerrard's last game in the Champions League - a Liverpool legend bowing out with a goal but unable to reproduce the heroics he had done against Olympiakos a decade before en route to Istanbul. After five years of waiting, it wasn't the way Liverpool had dreamt their comeback would go. Four more years on, Liverpool are back. And this time they look more than worthy members of Europe's elite. They have cantered into the quarter-finals - barely hitting second gear - and now they eye the prize of a place in the last four. Porto goalkeeper Iker Casillas may have played his final Champions League game tonight - if so, he leaves the competition with a record number of appearances. The 36-year-old, who played his 167th game on Tuesday, is expected to leave Porto at the end of the season and it is unclear where his future lies. But this was not the fairytale ending the three-time European champion might have hoped for. Despite a decent save from Ings late in the second half, it was largely a forgettable evening. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp speaking to BT Sport: \"We did the job and that was it tonight. \"It wasn't the most exciting game but we controlled it, had a few chances, got a clean sheet and gave some boys some minutes. I am pretty sure it is rare to have a game like this in the knockout stages! \"We needed to be serious and we were, so all good. Of course, we want to win two games at this stage. When you watch the game you always think 'oh come on, a little bit more here or there' but they did well and it is all good. The attitude was outstanding.\" On potentially drawing an English team in the quarter-final: \"I don't mind to be honest. I don't care. We take it how it comes. We don't wish for anybody. We play whoever we get. That is how it is. There are five English teams in and at one point we will play them so we will see when it comes.\" Liverpool prepare for a blockbuster fixture on Saturday as they travel to Old Trafford to take on Premier League rivals Manchester United (12:30 GMT) with second place in the table up for grabs.

        "content": "An ex-private investigator who was used by The Sunday Times has spoken about the criminal activity he was involved in to obtain information for the paper. John Ford said he targeted politicians such as Tony Blair and Gordon Brown when they were in government. He said his methods included \"blagging\" or pretending to be a bank or utilities account holder to get information. The Sunday Times said it \"strongly rejects\" the claim that it had ever commissioned anyone to act illegally. Mr Ford claims he was contracted by the paper between 1995 and 2010, during which time he said he targeted members of the Labour government elected in 1997 and members of the public. 'Stolen rubbish'\nAsked to describe the nature of his attacks on members of the cabinet, he responded: \"Aggressive, unprincipled. Fishing expeditions often.\" Talking about the techniques he used to get information, he said: \"I did their phones, I did their mobiles, I did their bank accounts, I stole their rubbish. \"Hundreds of telephone interceptions, hundreds of bank interceptions. \"Utilities. I've been through mortgages. I've stolen rubbish. I'm afraid the list is endless.\" A spokesperson for The Sunday Times said the paper had \"a strong record of investigative journalism over decades and has employed many contributors and researchers to work on stories, or parts of stories. \"The paper strongly rejects the accusation that it has in the past retained or commissioned any individual to act illegally. \"Some allegations related to the research work of John Ford have been aired previously and we cannot comment on the specifics of these new allegations which all predate 2011.\" The Sunday Times has also said it has always been its expectation and practice that its contractors work within the law. Mr Ford's admissions come just days after the government scrapped the second phase of the Leveson Inquiry. The first phase of the inquiry looked into the broad area of press ethics and the relationship between the press, politicians, police and the public. The second phase was withheld in order to avoid prejudicing criminal trials which are now complete. Explaining his decision to the Commons last week, Culture Secretary Matt Hancock said the second stage should not go ahead because it would be costly and deal with past failures. Instead, he argued, the more urgent task was to sustain newspapers - particularly local titles - at a time when they are under immense strain. Victims of press abuse argue that they were promised the second phase by David Cameron when he was prime minister. ",

        "content": "Chancellor Philip Hammond will tell European leaders that it is in the \"mutual interest\" of both the UK and the EU to include financial services in a free trade agreement. In a speech, Mr Hammond will set out his argument against \"sceptics\", saying it is possible to reach a deal. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has argued that such a deal had never been done before. But Mr Hammond will say the EU has in the past attempted similar agreements. In December, Mr Barnier said: \"There is not a single trade agreement that is open to financial services. It doesn't exist.\" Mr Hammond will say on Wednesday that the EU itself tried to include financial services within trade deals with the US and Canada. He will say: \"If it could be done with Canada or the USA ... it could be done with the UK.\" The Chancellor will stress: \"I am clear not only that it is possible to include financial services within a trade deal but that it is very much in our mutual interest to do so.\" The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier says a trade deal including financial services 'does not exist' On Tuesday, French economy minister Bruno Le Maire told the BBC: \"Financial services cannot be in a free trade agreement, for many reasons, for reasons of stability, for the sake of supervision because there are some very specific rules for financial services.\" He said that the \"best solution\", would be for a system of \"equivalence\" where both sides recognised each other's standards. But Mr Hammond will say: \"It is time to address the sceptics who say a trade deal including financial services cannot be done because it has never been done before. \"To them I say 'every trade deal the EU has ever done has been unique'. \"The EU has never negotiated the same arrangement twice. It has bespoke relationships with Turkey, Canada, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland.\" However, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: \"The Chancellor has shown his hand, and it is clear he is looking for a TTIP type deal as his blueprint. \"Yet those negotiations took nearly four years and collapsed, which is why a transition period is critical.\" Mr Hammond will also say: \"A trade deal between the UK and the EU must start from the reality of today, that our economies, including in financial services, are interconnected, that our regulatory frameworks are identical.\" Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, the trade body that represents the UK financial services sector, said: \"Thousands of customers and businesses in Europe rely on access to financial services from the UK. It is in everyone's interests for this vital cross-border trade to continue.\" ",

        "content": "US President Donald Trump has said European Union trade rules make it \"impossible\" for American firms to do business with the bloc. Defending his tariff plans as he hosted the Swedish PM at the White House, Mr Trump said other countries had \"taken advantage of\" the US for decades. His guest, Stefan Lofven, said: \"I am convinced that increased tariffs will hurt us all in the long run.\" The EU has drawn up a $3.5bn (\u00a32.5bn) hit list of retaliatory tariffs. Motorbikes, whiskey and T-shirts are on the bloc's list of 100 American products, the BBC understands. Bikes, bourbon and T-shirts on EU tax list The US president's proposed global duties on steel and aluminium have raised the prospect of a tit-for-tat trade war. \"The European Union has been particularly tough on the United States,\" Mr Trump said at Tuesday's joint press conference with the Swedish prime minister. \"They make it almost impossible for us to do business with them,\" Mr Trump complained. Mr Trump said if the EU retaliated, the US would impose a 25% tax on European cars. But the US president also said America would levy tariffs in a \"loving, loving way\". \"They'll like us better and they'll respect us more,\" he said about US trade partners who object to the plan. Mr Trump repeated his belief that the US would win any trade war, since it was running such a large trade deficit. \"When we're behind on every single country, trade wars aren't so bad,\" he told reporters at the White House. Mr Trump's decision to raise import taxes on steel to 25% and aluminium to 10% prompted strong reactions around the world last week. Mr Lofven, who is the first European leader to visit the White House since the tariffs were announced last week, said: \"I, of course, support the efforts of the European Union to achieve trade with fewer obstacles.\" Members of Mr Trump's Republican party have voicing disquiet at his proposal. Just before Mr Trump spoke, Senate leader Mitch McConnell said: \"There is a lot of concern among Republican senators that this could sort of metastasise into sort of a larger trade war.\" Earlier on Tuesday, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said the tariffs were too broad. He urged Mr Trump \"to be more surgical\" when selecting which countries to target \"so we do not have unintended consequences\". Congressman Mark Meadows, who chairs the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus, said most lawmakers had told him they did not support the president's decision. Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said his country was planning its own tariffs on US goods. He said they would issue them in a way that is most politically damaging to Mr Trump. \"We would have to target our response at the things they export that are most politically sensitive and hit exactly those goods,\" he told Mexican broadcaster Televisa.

        "content": "European champions Real Madrid moved into the Champions League quarter-finals as they beat Ligue 1 leaders Paris St-Germain at Parc des Princes. Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice in the first leg at home, which Real won 3-1, and he headed in from Lucas Vazquez's cross to extend Real's lead in France. PSG had midfielder Marco Verratti sent off for two bookable offences, before Edinson Cavani pulled a goal back. But Casemiro's heavily deflected strike sealed Real's victory. For PSG, 14 points clear at the top of Ligue 1, it is the second successive season where they have gone out at the last-16 phase and it leaves manager Unai Emery's future at the club in doubt. They were without injured forward Neymar and were not helped by Verratti's needless dismissal in the 66th minute. The Italy international was booked when he fouled Casemiro in the first half and was shown a second yellow card when he sprinted after referee Felix Brych and was cautioned for dissent. Real are now into the Champions League quarter-finals for an eighth successive season and remain on course for a third title in a row. Real won the Spanish Supercup in August and the Fifa Club World Cup in December, but manager Zinedine Zidane has come under increasing pressure with the club struggling in La Liga. They are in third place in the Spanish top flight, 15 points behind leaders Barcelona. However, Zidane got his tactics spot on against PSG, leaving Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and Gareth Bale on the bench as he looked to hit the hosts on the counter-attack, with Vazquez and Marco Asensio occupying the wide midfield roles. PSG had scored 86 goals in 28 Ligue 1 matches and also netted 25 times in their six Champions League group games, but were restricted to only three shots on target in this second leg, which was played in a fantastic atmosphere in Paris. Ronaldo netted his 12th goal in this season's Champions League when Real pounced on a Dani Alves error and the Portugal forward converted with a powerful header from six yards out after Vasquez's fine cross. Cavani scored a fortunate equaliser when a clearance rebounded off him into the net, but Casemiro's strike went in off PSG defender Marquinhos as Real made sure of their passage into the next round. It could have been even worse for PSG as Real also hit the woodwork twice, through Asensio and Vasquez, who collected a pull-back from substitute Bale, but struck the foot of the post. Paris St-Germain have won the Ligue 1 title in four of the past five years and are on course for another domestic success as they are 14 points clear of Monaco, who won the championship last season. However, the main trophy the club's owners, Qatar Sports Investments, had set their sights on was European football's biggest club prize - and once again they have fallen well short. They spent big in the summer to achieve that target, with Brazil forward Neymar moving from Barcelona for a world record fee of 222m euros (\u00a3200m), before taking Kylian Mbappe on a season-long loan from Monaco, with an option to make the deal permanent for 180m euros (\u00a3165.7m). PSG desperately missed Neymar, who is expected to be out for the rest of the season after having surgery on a broken bone in his foot following an injury sustained during their 3-0 league win over Marseille last week. With the money spent in the summer, this will be seen as another failure in European competition for them and Emery. Emery, who won the Europa League three times with Sevilla, has failed to take PSG beyond the last 16 in two attempts. Last season they lost 6-5 on aggregate against Barcelona, despite winning the first leg 4-0. PSG reached the Champions League semi-finals in 1994-95, but have not made it past the quarter-finals since then. Pat Nevin, BBC Radio 5 live pundit Having not been considered this season, Real Madrid now need to be considered as contenders. Real Madrid deserved to win the game, a really good performance. PSG had to be at their very best, but they were not. I am not sure Real Madrid were at their best, but they were 10 times better than they were against Tottenham (when they lost 3-1 at Wembley in the group stage in November). French football journalist Julien Laurens on BBC Radio 5 live PSG will have to start again. It shows that it is not easy to win the Champions League and you certainly cannot buy the Champions League, despite all the money they have spent. They will certainly need a better coach than Unai Emery because it is quite clear that he will not be the PSG manager next season. I think the owners have a shortlist now. They have anticipated this. Even if he had won the Champions League he may not have been the manager next season. There are even rumours that they tried to sack Unai Emery in December after the defeat to Bayern Munich away in the group stages. Someone like (Chelsea manager) Antonio Conte or (Tottenham boss) Mauricio Pochettino will be on the shortlist. You look at someone like (former Barcelona boss) Luis Enrique or (Juventus manager) Massimiliano Allegri as well. It is an attractive club for a lot of those managers. I don't think (Arsenal's) Arsene Wenger is the running anymore for the job. They have tried in the past for Jose Mourinho, but him signing a new deal at Manchester United has put this one to bed for now. The draw for the Champions League quarter-finals takes place on Friday, 16 March at 11:00 GMT at Uefa's headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. Before then, Real Madrid play away in La Liga on Saturday, 10 March (12:00 GMT) against Eibar, who are eighth in the division and in contention for a Europa League spot. PSG's next match is also on Saturday, at home to Metz in Ligue 1 (16:00 GMT). Line-ups\nMatch Stats\nLive Text\nMatch ends, Paris Saint Germain 1, Real Madrid 2.

        "content": "The UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian involvement in the collapse of former spy Sergei Skripal, Boris Johnson has said. Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are critically ill in hospital after being found unconscious in Salisbury, Wiltshire. The foreign secretary said he was not pointing fingers at this stage, but described Russia as \"a malign and disruptive force\". Russia has denied any involvement. Downing Street said Home Secretary Amber Rudd will chair a meeting of Cobra, the government's emergency committee, on Wednesday to discuss the Salisbury investigation. Counter Terrorism Police have taken over the investigation from Wiltshire Police. But in a statement, the unit said the inquiry had not been declared a terrorist incident and there was no risk to the wider public. Family deaths\nRelatives of Mr Skripal - a former Russian colonel convicted of spying for Britain - have told the BBC Russian Service that he believed the Russian special services might come after him at any time. His wife, elder brother and his son have died in the past two years, some in mysterious circumstances, the family believe. Ms Skripal lives in Moscow and has visited her father in the UK regularly, especially over the past two years. Mr Skripal and his daughter were found slumped and unconscious on a bench outside a shopping centre on Sunday afternoon. CCTV footage has been released by police which appears to show the pair walking through an alleyway near a Zizzi restaurant shortly before they collapsed. Police have since sealed off the restaurant and The Bishop's Mill pub was also cordoned off as a precaution. On Tuesday evening, police extended the cordon and shut off a bridge. Eyewitness Jamie Paine said the woman he saw was passed out, frothing at the mouth and her eyes \"were wide open but completely white\". He added: \"The man went stiff, his arms stopped moving but he was still looking dead straight.\" Two police officers caught up in the suspected contamination have been treated in hospital for minor symptoms, before they were given the all clear. It is understood their symptoms included itchy eyes and wheezing. A third member of the emergency services remains in hospital. Scientists at Porton Down - the UK's secret weapons research facility in Wiltshire - are studying the \"unknown substance\". Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, Mr Johnson said: \"Honourable members will note the echoes of the death of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006. \"I say to governments around the world that no attempt to take innocent life on UK soil will go unsanctioned or unpunished.\" Mr Johnson said the UK was \"in the lead across the world\" in trying to counteract a \"host of malign activity\" by Russia. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, but says it is open to co-operating with British police if requested. In a statement, the Russian embassy in London said: \"Media reports create an impression of a planned operation by the Russian special services, which is completely untrue.\" Responding to Mr Johnson's comments, the embassy added: \"Looks like the script of yet another anti-Russian campaign has been already written.\" BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban said Boris Johnson's strongly-worded statement indicates that the Government is \"party to some kind of intelligence\". \"It's evident from the foreign secretary's statement, and certainly the view in Whitehall is, he would not have gone this far unless the government was party to some kind of intelligence about what had gone on,\" Urban said. Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI as part of a swap. He was later flown to the UK. According to BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban, in recent years Col Skripal gave lectures at military academies offering insight into Russia's foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU. Read more about Sergei Skripal's background here. Putin, power and poison: Russia\u2019s elite FSB spy club Tony Brenton, the former British ambassador to Russia, suggested that Mr Skripal would have had many enemies - including many former colleagues He said: \"The fact that he blew a whole range of Russian agents, there may be personal animosities there. \"In most Russians' minds he would be categorised as a traitor. There are people there who would be delighted to see him dead.\" The possibility of an unexplained substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko. The Russian dissident and former intelligence officer died in London after drinking tea laced with a radioactive substance. A public inquiry concluded that his killing had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Andrei Lugovoi, the former Russian agent accused of poisoning Litvinenko but who denies the claims, told the BBC that Russia would have considered the matter closed when Mr Skripal was flown to the UK as part of a spy swap in 2010. Mr Skripal was pardoned by the Russian President and so the incident was over, Mr Lugovoi said. Igor Sutyagin, who was one of four agents released by Moscow in the exchange, is now a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). He told the BBC's World Tonight programme that he was not yet concerned for his safety and added: \"I don't think that he (Mr Skripal) would be targeted, because he was pardoned.\" But Mr Litvinenko's widow, Marina Litvinenko, told the programme that the latest incident felt like \"deja vu\" - and called for those receiving political asylum to be protected by the UK. Meanwhile, the Home Affairs Committee has asked for a review into 14 deaths that have not been treated as suspicious by British police but have reportedly been identified as potentially linked to Russia. The reaction in Russia\nBy BBC Monitoring Russian state TV's coverage of the possible poisoning in the UK of former agent Sergei Skripal has been eccentric, to say the least. State TV remains the main source of news for most Russians. The main official TV channel Rossiya 1 covered the story early in the day, but studiously ignored any comparison with the poisoning in 2006 of former Russian FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko, which has been a prominent feature of reports in the UK media. This evening, the main primetime bulletin on Rossiya 1 and the two other main Russian TV stations, Channel One and NTV, did not touch the story. The oddities in the coverage did not stop there, though. On Rossiya 24, the country's main news channel and the sister channel to Rossiya 1, the Skripal case was the main story this evening, with a report accusing the UK authorities and media of conspiring to blacken Russia's name. The presenter described the case as a \"new classic in British conspirology\" The popular tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda described the poisoning as \"another scandal with a dash of Russophobia\". Russian news agencies reported the indignation expressed by officials as they criticised Boris Johnson's warning to Russia. \"The demonisation of Russia\", said a Russian embassy press release. \"This is preposterous,\" the Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova was quoted as telling Interfax news agency. Mr Johnson's comments are \"unacceptable and in \"extremely bad faith,\" said Konstantin Kosachyov, head of the International Affairs Committee of the Federation Council upper house of parliament. Analysis\nBy Norman Smith, BBC assistant political editor Although Boris Johnson was careful to stress this was still an ongoing investigation - it's absolutely clear he, and others in government, believe it's highly likely this was a Russian state-sponsored attack. The big question now - how does the government respond? A question made more pressing by accusations that ministers were guilty of appeasement in the wake of Alexander Litvinenko's killing. Mr Johnson suggested there could be targeted sanctions against those close to President Putin. And, perhaps most significantly, in an indication the government could seek to rally international support to make a stand against Russia, Mr Johnson said there could be a co-ordinated response with Nato allies. Whatever measures are eventually decided upon - if Russian involvement is proven - it's clear relations between London and Moscow have plunged to new depths.

        "content": "US President Donald Trump has said European Union trade rules make it \"impossible\" for American firms to do business with the bloc. Defending his tariff plans as he hosted the Swedish PM at the White House, Mr Trump said other countries had \"taken advantage of\" the US for decades. His guest, Stefan Lofven, said: \"I am convinced that increased tariffs will hurt us all in the long run.\" The EU has drawn up a $3.5bn (\u00a32.5bn) hit list of retaliatory tariffs. Motorbikes, whiskey and T-shirts are on the bloc's list of 100 American products, the BBC understands. Bikes, bourbon and T-shirts on EU tax list The US president's proposed global duties on steel and aluminium have raised the prospect of a tit-for-tat trade war. \"The European Union has been particularly tough on the United States,\" Mr Trump said at Tuesday's joint press conference with the Swedish prime minister. \"They make it almost impossible for us to do business with them,\" Mr Trump complained. Mr Trump said if the EU retaliated, the US would impose a 25% tax on European cars. But the US president also said America would levy tariffs in a \"loving, loving way\". \"They'll like us better and they'll respect us more,\" he said about US trade partners who object to the plan. Mr Trump repeated his belief that the US would win any trade war, since it was running such a large trade deficit. \"When we're behind on every single country, trade wars aren't so bad,\" he told reporters at the White House. Mr Trump's decision to raise import taxes on steel to 25% and aluminium to 10% prompted strong reactions around the world last week. Mr Lofven, who is the first European leader to visit the White House since the tariffs were announced last week, said: \"I, of course, support the efforts of the European Union to achieve trade with fewer obstacles.\" Members of Mr Trump's Republican party have voicing disquiet at his proposal. Just before Mr Trump spoke, Senate leader Mitch McConnell said: \"There is a lot of concern among Republican senators that this could sort of metastasise into sort of a larger trade war.\" Earlier on Tuesday, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said the tariffs were too broad. He urged Mr Trump \"to be more surgical\" when selecting which countries to target \"so we do not have unintended consequences\". Congressman Mark Meadows, who chairs the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus, said most lawmakers had told him they did not support the president's decision. Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said his country was planning its own tariffs on US goods. He said they would issue them in a way that is most politically damaging to Mr Trump. \"We would have to target our response at the things they export that are most politically sensitive and hit exactly those goods,\" he told Mexican broadcaster Televisa.

        "content": "Chancellor Philip Hammond will tell European leaders that it is in the \"mutual interest\" of both the UK and the EU to include financial services in a free trade agreement. In a speech, Mr Hammond will set out his argument against \"sceptics\", saying it is possible to reach a deal. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has argued that such a deal had never been done before. But Mr Hammond will say the EU has in the past attempted similar agreements. In December, Mr Barnier said: \"There is not a single trade agreement that is open to financial services. It doesn't exist.\" Mr Hammond will say on Wednesday that the EU itself tried to include financial services within trade deals with the US and Canada. He will say: \"If it could be done with Canada or the USA ... it could be done with the UK.\" The Chancellor will stress: \"I am clear not only that it is possible to include financial services within a trade deal but that it is very much in our mutual interest to do so.\" The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier says a trade deal including financial services 'does not exist' On Tuesday, French economy minister Bruno Le Maire told the BBC: \"Financial services cannot be in a free trade agreement, for many reasons, for reasons of stability, for the sake of supervision because there are some very specific rules for financial services.\" He said that the \"best solution\", would be for a system of \"equivalence\" where both sides recognised each other's standards. But Mr Hammond will say: \"It is time to address the sceptics who say a trade deal including financial services cannot be done because it has never been done before. \"To them I say 'every trade deal the EU has ever done has been unique'. \"The EU has never negotiated the same arrangement twice. It has bespoke relationships with Turkey, Canada, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland.\" However, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: \"The Chancellor has shown his hand, and it is clear he is looking for a TTIP type deal as his blueprint. \"Yet those negotiations took nearly four years and collapsed, which is why a transition period is critical.\" Mr Hammond will also say: \"A trade deal between the UK and the EU must start from the reality of today, that our economies, including in financial services, are interconnected, that our regulatory frameworks are identical.\" Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, the trade body that represents the UK financial services sector, said: \"Thousands of customers and businesses in Europe rely on access to financial services from the UK. It is in everyone's interests for this vital cross-border trade to continue.\" ",

        "content": "Donald Trump has reacted cautiously to news that North Korea is willing to talk about giving up its nuclear weapons if it did not feel threatened. The US president said \"the statements coming out of South Korea and North Korea have been very positive\", but also said it might be a \"false hope\". South Korea earlier said the subject was raised when its officials met the North's leader, Kim Jong-un, on Monday. Seoul said Mr Kim was also open to US talks, and would pause weapons testing. However previous talks with North Korea have come to nothing. There has also been no immediate comment from Pyongyang itself. Further news that the leaders of North and South Korea have also agreed to meet at a summit next month, came via the leader of the South's delegation, Chung Eui-yong. It would be the first such meeting for more than a decade and the first since Kim Jong-un took power in North Korea in 2011. North Korea crisis in 300 words What did President Trump say?\n\"We have come certainly a long way, at least rhetorically, with North Korea,\" Mr Trump said. \"The statements coming out of South Korea and North Korea have been very positive. That would be a great thing for the world.\" The US leader also praised Pyongyang for its decision to take part in the Pyeongchang Olympics in South Korea. But he earlier posted a cautious tweet, warning about a \"false hope\". Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction! End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump While the US president said he believed Pyongyang's offer to hold denuclearization talks was \"sincere\" he said it was \"also because of the sanctions and what we're doing with respect to North Korea.\" Meanwhile, US Vice-President Mike Pence said the US remained \"committed to applying maximum pressure on the Kim regime to end their nuclear program\". All options were on the table, he said, and US posture towards the regime would not change \"until we see credible, verifiable, and concrete steps toward denuclearisation\". The US has maintained that North Korean gestures of rapprochement would carry little weight without a commitment on nuclear weapons - particularly following last year's nuclear and missile tests carried out by the North. The South Korean delegation is expected to visit Washington later this week to brief US officials on their talks in the North. What is North Korea reported to have said?\nA statement from the South Korea president's office issued earlier on Tuesday said: \"The North showed willingness on denuclearisation in the Korean Peninsula. If military threats to the North Korea decrease and regime safety is guaranteed, the North showed that it has no reason to retain nukes.\" The North's KCNA news agency said Mr Kim had \"warmly welcomed\" the delegates and held an \"openhearted talk\" with them. It said the dinner took place \"in a warm atmosphere overflowing with compatriotic feelings\". However, some critics have suspicions over North Korea's intentions. In the past, they have failed to follow through on deals, notably an aid-for-disarmament agreement in 2005. What happened at the Pyongyang dinner?\nSouth Korean officials had a four-hour dinner with Kim Jong-un on Monday. Among the delegation were intelligence chief Suh Hoon and National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong. Pictures showed Mr Kim and visitors from the South smiling broadly around a dinner table. Also present was Mr Kim's wife, Ri Sol-ju, who rarely appears at official events, and his sister Kim Yo-jong, who was part of a North Korean delegation to the Pyeongchang Olympics. The two sides appear to be aiming to capitalise on the reduced tensions after the Games, which saw the Koreas march together under one flag. During their visit, the South's officials also held a boardroom meeting and passed on a letter from South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in which he invited Mr Kim to attend further talks. KCNA said Mr Kim had \"exchanged views and made a satisfactory agreement\" on the letter and gave orders for it to be acted on. Why is North Korea acting now?\nIt is difficult to be certain. Since the South made the announcement, there has been no comment from North Korea. Some US and South Korean officials have said that Pyongyang may simply be trying to buy time to develop weapons programmes. There have also been suggestions that Mr Kim is trying to soften the impact of biting sanctions on the impoverished country, seeking food and other aid from overseas. Another factor may be growing diplomatic pressure from North Korea's neighbours, particularly from China - the regional superpower and Pyongyang's only real ally. History of broken promises\nA series of six-party talks have been held since North Korea decided to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 2003. But attempts to negotiate aid-for-disarmament deals have repeatedly failed. In 2009, North Korea pulled out of the talks and expelled all nuclear inspectors from the country, in response to UN Security Council criticism of a rocket launch. Pyongyang also vowed to resume its nuclear activities. A number of bids to restart the talks collapsed, including in 2012 when North Korea launched another rocket, two weeks after announcing a \"leap day\" agreement with the US. The North said it was commemorating the birth of its founding father, with a new satellite, but it was condemned by others as a provocative test of missile technology. Throughout 2017 Mr Kim ordered a series of incendiary ballistic missile tests, significantly raising the stakes. In response the UN implemented increasingly tough sanctions. ",

        "content": "European champions Real Madrid moved into the Champions League quarter-finals as they beat Ligue 1 leaders Paris St-Germain at Parc des Princes. Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice in the first leg at home, which Real won 3-1, and he headed in from Lucas Vazquez's cross to extend Real's lead in France. PSG had midfielder Marco Verratti sent off for two bookable offences, before Edinson Cavani pulled a goal back. But Casemiro's heavily deflected strike sealed Real's victory. For PSG, 14 points clear at the top of Ligue 1, it is the second successive season where they have gone out at the last-16 phase and it leaves manager Unai Emery's future at the club in doubt. They were without injured forward Neymar and were not helped by Verratti's needless dismissal in the 66th minute. The Italy international was booked when he fouled Casemiro in the first half and was shown a second yellow card when he sprinted after referee Felix Brych and was cautioned for dissent. Real are now into the Champions League quarter-finals for an eighth successive season and remain on course for a third title in a row. Real won the Spanish Supercup in August and the Fifa Club World Cup in December, but manager Zinedine Zidane has come under increasing pressure with the club struggling in La Liga. They are in third place in the Spanish top flight, 15 points behind leaders Barcelona. However, Zidane got his tactics spot on against PSG, leaving Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and Gareth Bale on the bench as he looked to hit the hosts on the counter-attack, with Vazquez and Marco Asensio occupying the wide midfield roles. PSG had scored 86 goals in 28 Ligue 1 matches and also netted 25 times in their six Champions League group games, but were restricted to only three shots on target in this second leg, which was played in a fantastic atmosphere in Paris. Ronaldo netted his 12th goal in this season's Champions League when Real pounced on a Dani Alves error and the Portugal forward converted with a powerful header from six yards out after Vasquez's fine cross. Cavani scored a fortunate equaliser when a clearance rebounded off him into the net, but Casemiro's strike went in off PSG defender Marquinhos as Real made sure of their passage into the next round. It could have been even worse for PSG as Real also hit the woodwork twice, through Asensio and Vasquez, who collected a pull-back from substitute Bale, but struck the foot of the post. Paris St-Germain have won the Ligue 1 title in four of the past five years and are on course for another domestic success as they are 14 points clear of Monaco, who won the championship last season. However, the main trophy the club's owners, Qatar Sports Investments, had set their sights on was European football's biggest club prize - and once again they have fallen well short. They spent big in the summer to achieve that target, with Brazil forward Neymar moving from Barcelona for a world record fee of 222m euros (\u00a3200m), before taking Kylian Mbappe on a season-long loan from Monaco, with an option to make the deal permanent for 180m euros (\u00a3165.7m). PSG desperately missed Neymar, who is expected to be out for the rest of the season after having surgery on a broken bone in his foot following an injury sustained during their 3-0 league win over Marseille last week. With the money they spent in the summer, this will be seen as another failure in European competition for them and Emery. Emery, who won the Europa League three times with Sevilla, has failed to take PSG beyond the last 16 in two attempts. Last season they lost 6-5 on aggregate against Barcelona, despite winning the first leg 4-0. PSG reached the Champions League semi-finals in 1994-95, but have not made it past the quarter-finals since then. Pat Nevin, BBC Radio 5 live pundit Having not been considered this season, Real Madrid now need to be considered as contenders. Real Madrid deserved to win the game, a really good performance. PSG had to be at their very best, but they were not. I am not sure Real Madrid were at their best, but they were 10 times better than they were against Tottenham (when they lost 3-1 at Wembley in the group stage in November). French football journalist Julien Laurens on BBC Radio 5 live PSG will have to start again. It shows that it is not easy to win the Champions League and you certainly cannot buy the Champions League, despite all the money they have spent. They will certainly need a better coach than Unai Emery because it is quite clear that he will not be the PSG manager next season. I think the owners have a shortlist now. They have anticipated this. Even if he had won the Champions League he may not have been the manager next season. There are even rumours that they tried to sack Unai Emery in December after the defeat to Bayern Munich away in the group stages. Someone like (Chelsea manager) Antonio Conte or (Tottenham boss) Mauricio Pochettino will be on the shortlist. You look at someone like (former Barcelona boss) Luis Enrique or (Juventus manager) Massimiliano Allegri as well. It is an attractive club for a lot of those managers. I don't think (Arsenal's) Arsene Wenger is the running anymore for the job. They have tried in the past for Jose Mourinho, but him signing a new deal at Manchester United has put this one to bed for now. Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane said on BT Sport: \"We started very well, but we deserved the win. It was a tough match, they wanted to get through but they were up against a strong team and that perhaps made the difference. \"I must praise the players, they are the ones giving everything on the pitch. This is a tough crowd to come to, but the atmosphere is fantastic. We were focused and deserved to get through.\" The draw for the Champions League quarter-finals takes place on Friday, 16 March at 11:00 GMT at Uefa's headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. Before then, Real Madrid play away in La Liga on Saturday, 10 March (12:00 GMT) against Eibar, who are eighth in the division and in contention for a Europa League spot. PSG's next match is also on Saturday, at home to Metz in Ligue 1 (16:00 GMT). Line-ups\nMatch Stats\nLive Text\nMatch ends, Paris Saint Germain 1, Real Madrid 2.

        "content": "The UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian involvement in the collapse of former spy Sergei Skripal, Boris Johnson has said. Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are critically ill in hospital after being found unconscious in Salisbury, Wiltshire. The foreign secretary said he was not pointing fingers at this stage, but described Russia as \"a malign and disruptive force\". Russia has denied any involvement. Downing Street said Home Secretary Amber Rudd will chair a meeting of Cobra, the government's emergency committee, on Wednesday to discuss the Salisbury investigation. Counter Terrorism Police have taken over the investigation from Wiltshire Police. But in a statement, the unit said the inquiry had not been declared a terrorist incident and there was no risk to the wider public. Family deaths\nRelatives of Mr Skripal - a former Russian colonel convicted of spying for Britain - have told the BBC Russian Service that he believed the Russian special services might come after him at any time. His wife, elder brother and his son have died in the past two years, some in mysterious circumstances, the family believe. Ms Skripal lives in Moscow and has visited her father in the UK regularly, especially over the past two years. Mr Skripal and his daughter were found slumped and unconscious on a bench outside a shopping centre on Sunday afternoon. CCTV footage has been released by police which appears to show the pair walking through an alleyway near a Zizzi restaurant shortly before they collapsed. Police have since sealed off the restaurant and The Bishop's Mill pub was also cordoned off as a precaution. On Tuesday evening, police extended the cordon and shut off a bridge. Eyewitness Jamie Paine said the woman he saw was passed out, frothing at the mouth and her eyes \"were wide open but completely white\". He added: \"The man went stiff, his arms stopped moving but he was still looking dead straight.\" Two police officers caught up in the suspected contamination have been treated in hospital for minor symptoms, before they were given the all clear. It is understood their symptoms included itchy eyes and wheezing. A third member of the emergency services remains in hospital. Scientists at Porton Down - the UK's secret weapons research facility in Wiltshire - are studying the \"unknown substance\". On Tuesday evening, BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban said there are concerns the pair's conditions could worsen. Despite the sending of samples, scientists have still not identified the substance and one official at Porton Down said \"we are treating symptoms rather than causes\", Urban said. Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, Mr Johnson said: \"Honourable members will note the echoes of the death of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006. \"I say to governments around the world that no attempt to take innocent life on UK soil will go unsanctioned or unpunished.\" Mr Johnson said the UK was \"in the lead across the world\" in trying to counteract a \"host of malign activity\" by Russia. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, but says it is open to co-operating with British police if requested. In a statement, the Russian embassy in London said: \"Media reports create an impression of a planned operation by the Russian special services, which is completely untrue.\" Responding to Mr Johnson's comments, the embassy added: \"Looks like the script of yet another anti-Russian campaign has been already written.\" BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban said Boris Johnson's strongly-worded statement indicates that the Government is \"party to some kind of intelligence\". \"It's evident from the foreign secretary's statement, and certainly the view in Whitehall is, he would not have gone this far unless the government was party to some kind of intelligence about what had gone on,\" Urban said. Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI as part of a swap. He was later flown to the UK. According to BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban, in recent years Col Skripal gave lectures at military academies offering insight into Russia's foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU. Read more about Sergei Skripal's background here. Putin, power and poison: Russia\u2019s elite FSB spy club Tony Brenton, the former British ambassador to Russia, suggested that Mr Skripal would have had many enemies - including many former colleagues He said: \"The fact that he blew a whole range of Russian agents, there may be personal animosities there. \"In most Russians' minds he would be categorised as a traitor. There are people there who would be delighted to see him dead.\" The possibility of an unexplained substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko. The Russian dissident and former intelligence officer died in London after drinking tea laced with a radioactive substance. A public inquiry concluded that his killing had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Andrei Lugovoi, the former Russian agent accused of poisoning Litvinenko but who denies the claims, told the BBC that Russia would have considered the matter closed when Mr Skripal was flown to the UK as part of a spy swap in 2010. Mr Skripal was pardoned by the Russian President and so the incident was over, Mr Lugovoi said. Igor Sutyagin, who was one of four agents released by Moscow in the exchange, is now a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). He told the BBC's World Tonight programme that he was not yet concerned for his safety and added: \"I don't think that he (Mr Skripal) would be targeted, because he was pardoned.\" But Mr Litvinenko's widow, Marina Litvinenko, told the programme that the latest incident felt like \"deja vu\" - and called for those receiving political asylum to be protected by the UK. Meanwhile, the Home Affairs Committee has asked for a review into 14 deaths that have not been treated as suspicious by British police but have reportedly been identified as potentially linked to Russia. The reaction in Russia\nBy BBC Monitoring Russian state TV's coverage of the possible poisoning in the UK of former agent Sergei Skripal has been eccentric, to say the least. State TV remains the main source of news for most Russians. The main official TV channel Rossiya 1 covered the story early in the day, but studiously ignored any comparison with the poisoning in 2006 of former Russian FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko, which has been a prominent feature of reports in the UK media. This evening, the main primetime bulletin on Rossiya 1 and the two other main Russian TV stations, Channel One and NTV, did not touch the story. The oddities in the coverage did not stop there, though. On Rossiya 24, the country's main news channel and the sister channel to Rossiya 1, the Skripal case was the main story this evening, with a report accusing the UK authorities and media of conspiring to blacken Russia's name. The presenter described the case as a \"new classic in British conspirology\" The popular tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda described the poisoning as \"another scandal with a dash of Russophobia\". Russian news agencies reported the indignation expressed by officials as they criticised Boris Johnson's warning to Russia. \"The demonisation of Russia\", said a Russian embassy press release. \"This is preposterous,\" the Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova was quoted as telling Interfax news agency. Mr Johnson's comments are \"unacceptable and in \"extremely bad faith,\" said Konstantin Kosachyov, head of the International Affairs Committee of the Federation Council upper house of parliament. Analysis\nBy Norman Smith, BBC assistant political editor Although Boris Johnson was careful to stress this was still an ongoing investigation - it's absolutely clear he, and others in government, believe it's highly likely this was a Russian state-sponsored attack. The big question now - how does the government respond? A question made more pressing by accusations that ministers were guilty of appeasement in the wake of Alexander Litvinenko's killing. Mr Johnson suggested there could be targeted sanctions against those close to President Putin. And, perhaps most significantly, in an indication the government could seek to rally international support to make a stand against Russia, Mr Johnson said there could be a co-ordinated response with Nato allies. Whatever measures are eventually decided upon - if Russian involvement is proven - it's clear relations between London and Moscow have plunged to new depths.

        "content": "Jurgen Klopp says Liverpool \"belong\" in the Champions League quarter-finals after a 0-0 second-leg draw at Anfield gave them a 5-0 aggregate win over Porto in their last-16 tie. It is the first time since 2009 the Reds have reached the last eight but Klopp insisted it \"should not be a big surprise\". Liverpool won 5-0 in Portugal to set up a comfortable return leg at Anfield. They will discover their next opponents when the draw is made on 16 March. \"The next round will be difficult, seven other very good teams - maybe four of them are from England, which doesn't make it easier,\" Klopp said. \"I think we will have a chance for sure to go to the semi-finals. We'll take it step by step.\" The quarter-final ties will be played in the first and second weeks of April and Klopp says he \"doesn't care\" who Liverpool's opponents are. \"We take it how it comes,\" he said. \"We don't wish for anybody. We play whoever we get.\" It wasn't a spectacular ending to Liverpool's last-16 tie but there were a few chances to break the deadlock. Sadio Mane acrobatically fired an effort over the bar and hit the post in a generally tame first half that also saw Dejan Lovren head narrowly wide. Danny Ings picked up some rare game-time as a second-half substitute and was denied from close range by Iker Casillas late in the game after Majeed Waris' strike - Porto's only shot on target. Klopp used the opportunity to rest players for Liverpool's Premier League match against Manchester United on Saturday (12:30 GMT), making five changes to the starting line-up. Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah were named among the substitutes but the Egyptian did have a cameo in the second half as Mane was given a breather. There was also a chance for Joe Gomez and Adam Lallana to gain further fitness following returns from injury. It is almost 11 years since Liverpool faced AC Milan in the Champions League final, losing 2-1 in Athens. Back then they were hitting the heights in European football pretty regularly - the most successful English club in the competition's history, it was just two years since they had beaten the same opponents to lift their fifth trophy on a famous night in Istanbul. But since being knocked out at the group stage in 2009, Liverpool have only featured in the Champions League twice. It was a dejected-looking Reds side who trudged off the field in December 2014, a 1-1 draw with Basel confirming their elimination from the competition after a wretched campaign. It would be Steven Gerrard's last game in the Champions League - a Liverpool legend bowing out with a goal but unable to reproduce the heroics he had done against Olympiakos a decade before en route to Istanbul. After five years of waiting, it wasn't the way Liverpool had dreamt their comeback would go. Four more years on, Liverpool are back. And this time they look more than worthy members of Europe's elite. They have cantered into the quarter-finals - barely hitting second gear - and now they eye the prize of a place in the last four. Porto goalkeeper Casillas may have played his final Champions League game tonight - if so, he leaves the competition with a record number of appearances. The 36-year-old, who played his 167th game on Tuesday, is expected to leave Porto at the end of the season and it is unclear where his future lies. But this was not the fairytale ending the three-time European champion might have hoped for. Despite a decent save from Ings late in the second half, it was largely a forgettable evening. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp speaking to BT Sport: \"We did the job and that was it tonight. \"It wasn't the most exciting game but we controlled it, had a few chances, got a clean sheet and gave some boys some minutes. I am pretty sure it is rare to have a game like this in the knockout stages! \"We needed to be serious and we were, so all good. Of course, we want to win two games at this stage. When you watch the game you always think 'oh come on, a little bit more here or there' but they did well and it is all good. The attitude was outstanding.\" Liverpool prepare for a blockbuster fixture on Saturday as they travel to Old Trafford to take on Premier League rivals Manchester United (12:30 GMT) with second place in the table up for grabs.

        "content": "European champions Real Madrid moved into the Champions League quarter-finals as they beat Ligue 1 leaders Paris St-Germain at Parc des Princes. Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice in the first leg at home, which Real won 3-1, and he headed in from Lucas Vazquez's cross to extend Real's lead in France. PSG had midfielder Marco Verratti sent off for two bookable offences, before Edinson Cavani pulled a goal back. But Casemiro's heavily deflected strike sealed Real's victory. For PSG, 14 points clear at the top of Ligue 1, it is the second successive season where they have gone out at the last-16 phase and it leaves manager Unai Emery's future at the club in doubt. They were without injured forward Neymar and were not helped by Verratti's needless dismissal in the 66th minute. The Italy international was booked when he fouled Casemiro in the first half and was shown a second yellow card when he sprinted after referee Felix Brych and was cautioned for dissent. Real are now into the Champions League quarter-finals for an eighth successive season and remain on course for a third title in a row. Real won the Spanish Supercup in August and the Fifa Club World Cup in December, but manager Zinedine Zidane has come under increasing pressure with the club struggling in La Liga. They are in third place in the Spanish top flight, 15 points behind leaders Barcelona. However, Zidane got his tactics spot on against PSG, leaving Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and Gareth Bale on the bench as he looked to hit the hosts on the counter-attack, with Vazquez and Marco Asensio occupying the wide midfield roles. PSG had scored 86 goals in 28 Ligue 1 matches and also netted 25 times in their six Champions League group games, but were restricted to only three shots on target in this second leg, which was played in a fantastic atmosphere in Paris. Ronaldo netted his 12th goal in this season's Champions League when Real pounced on a Dani Alves error and the Portugal forward converted with a powerful header from six yards out after Vasquez's fine cross. Cavani scored a fortunate equaliser when a clearance rebounded off him into the net, but Casemiro's strike went in off PSG defender Marquinhos as Real made sure of their passage into the next round. It could have been even worse for PSG as Real also hit the woodwork twice, through Asensio and Vasquez, who collected a pull-back from substitute Bale, but struck the foot of the post. Paris St-Germain have won the Ligue 1 title in four of the past five years and are on course for another domestic success as they are 14 points clear of Monaco, who won the championship last season. However, the main trophy the club's owners, Qatar Sports Investments, had set their sights on was European football's biggest club prize - and once again they have fallen well short. They spent big in the summer to achieve that target, with Brazil forward Neymar moving from Barcelona for a world record fee of 222m euros (\u00a3200m), before taking Kylian Mbappe on a season-long loan from Monaco, with an option to make the deal permanent for 180m euros (\u00a3165.7m). PSG desperately missed Neymar, who is expected to be out for the rest of the season after having surgery on a broken bone in his foot following an injury sustained during their 3-0 league win over Marseille last week. With the money they spent in the summer, this will be seen as another failure in European competition for them and Emery. Emery, who won the Europa League three times with Sevilla, has failed to take PSG beyond the last 16 in two attempts. Last season they lost 6-5 on aggregate against Barcelona, despite winning the first leg 4-0. PSG reached the Champions League semi-finals in 1994-95, but have not made it past the quarter-finals since then. Pat Nevin, BBC Radio 5 live pundit Having not been considered this season, Real Madrid now need to be considered as contenders. Real Madrid deserved to win the game, a really good performance. PSG had to be at their very best, but they were not. I am not sure Real Madrid were at their best, but they were 10 times better than they were against Tottenham (when they lost 3-1 at Wembley in the group stage in November). French football journalist Julien Laurens on BBC Radio 5 live PSG will have to start again. It shows that it is not easy to win the Champions League and you certainly cannot buy the Champions League, despite all the money they have spent. They will certainly need a better coach than Unai Emery because it is quite clear that he will not be the PSG manager next season. I think the owners have a shortlist now. They have anticipated this. Even if he had won the Champions League he may not have been the manager next season. There are even rumours that they tried to sack Unai Emery in December after the defeat to Bayern Munich away in the group stages. Someone like (Chelsea manager) Antonio Conte or (Tottenham boss) Mauricio Pochettino will be on the shortlist. You look at someone like (former Barcelona boss) Luis Enrique or (Juventus manager) Massimiliano Allegri as well. It is an attractive club for a lot of those managers. I don't think (Arsenal's) Arsene Wenger is the running anymore for the job. They have tried in the past for Jose Mourinho, but him signing a new deal at Manchester United has put this one to bed for now. PSG boss Unai Emery said: \"It's true that Madrid deserved to go through and in the important moments of the game, they were better. \"They controlled 60% of the game and we didn't do enough with the 40% we had. Losing to Real Madrid itself isn't a disappointment, but being knocked out in the last 16 is. \"Perhaps the first half was the key. In the last 20 minutes of the first half we were better. Over there [in Spain] we had the chance, it was 50-50, but we didn't take advantage of that.\" Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane said on BT Sport: \"We started very well, but we deserved the win. It was a tough match, they wanted to get through but they were up against a strong team and that perhaps made the difference. \"I must praise the players, they are the ones giving everything on the pitch. This is a tough crowd to come to, but the atmosphere is fantastic. We were focused and deserved to get through.\" The draw for the Champions League quarter-finals takes place on Friday, 16 March at 11:00 GMT at Uefa's headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. Before then, Real Madrid play away in La Liga on Saturday, 10 March (12:00 GMT) against Eibar, who are eighth in the division and in contention for a Europa League spot. PSG's next match is also on Saturday, at home to Metz in Ligue 1 (16:00 GMT). Line-ups\nMatch Stats\nLive Text\nMatch ends, Paris Saint Germain 1, Real Madrid 2.

        "content": "US President Donald Trump has said European Union trade rules make it \"impossible\" for American firms to do business with the bloc. Defending his tariff plans as he hosted the Swedish PM at the White House, Mr Trump said other countries had \"taken advantage of\" the US for decades. Shortly afterwards it was announced that White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, who opposes tariffs, would quit. The EU has drawn up a $3.5bn (\u00a32.5bn) hit list of retaliatory tariffs. Motorbikes, whiskey and T-shirts are on the bloc's list of 100 American products, the BBC understands. The US president's proposed global duties on steel and aluminium have raised the prospect of a tit-for-tat trade war. \"The European Union has been particularly tough on the United States,\" Mr Trump said at Tuesday's joint press conference with the Swedish prime minister. \"They make it almost impossible for us to do business with them,\" Mr Trump complained. Mr Trump said if the EU retaliated, the US would impose a 25% tax on European cars. But the US president also said America would levy tariffs in a \"loving, loving way\". \"They'll like us better and they'll respect us more,\" he said about US trade partners who object to the plan. Mr Trump repeated his belief that the US would win any trade war, since it was running such a large trade deficit. \"When we're behind on every single country, trade wars aren't so bad,\" he told reporters at the White House. Mr Trump's decision to raise import taxes on steel to 25% and aluminium to 10% prompted strong reactions around the world last week. Swedish PM Stefan Lofven said: \"I am convinced that increased tariffs will hurt us all in the long run.\" Mr Lofven is the first European leader to visit the White House since the tariffs were announced last week. Members of Mr Trump's Republican party have voicing disquiet at his proposal. Just before Mr Trump spoke, Senate leader Mitch McConnell said: \"There is a lot of concern among Republican senators that this could sort of metastasise into sort of a larger trade war.\" Earlier on Tuesday, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said the tariffs were too broad. He urged Mr Trump \"to be more surgical\" when selecting which countries to target \"so we do not have unintended consequences\". Congressman Mark Meadows, who chairs the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus, said most lawmakers had told him they did not support the president's decision. Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said his country was planning its own tariffs on US goods. He said they would issue them in a way that is most politically damaging to Mr Trump. \"We would have to target our response at the things they export that are most politically sensitive and hit exactly those goods,\" he told Mexican broadcaster Televisa.

Faruq Khalil Muhammad 'Isa pleaded guilty in New York City to providing money to Tunisian suicide bombers. The charges carried a maximum life sentence, but he will face 26 years in prison then deportation, AP reports. The 50-year-old moved to Toronto in 1993 as a Kurdish refugee before becoming a Canadian citizen. Muhammad 'Isa was arrested in 2011 following an investigation by Canadian, US and Tunisian authorities. He lost his fight against extradition in 2015 when Canada's Supreme Court refused to hear his case, and was sent to the US. Two Iraqi policemen also died in the explosion in Mosul in April 2009 that killed the American troops. Muhammad 'Isa admitted to emailing two of the attackers, and wiring a middleman $700 (\u00a3504) to help get them into Iraq. US officials also said he sought to become a suicide bomber himself, telling his mother in 2009 that his greatest wish was to die a martyr. ",

        "content": "The UK's four main secondary ticketing agencies have been banned from using certain \"misleading\" price strategies. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said they had not been clear enough about extra fees added at the end of the booking. The four largest sites are Get Me In, Viagogo, StubHub and Seatwave. Such firms have attracted increasing criticism and last month Google changed the way the sites are listed after pressure from Ed Sheeran's manager. Secondary ticketing sites are designed to re-sell tickets to concerts, shows and events where the original buyer can no longer attend. 'Frustration'\nThe ASA's move is the latest in a string of actions taken against businesses who have been accused of misleading fans by claiming that they are official sellers of tickets, over-charging buyers or selling tickets that are invalid if they are re-sold. Websites must now make the total ticket price, the VAT-inclusive booking fee and the delivery fee clear from the start. The ASA has also banned Viagogo from claiming that it is an \"official site\" after it misleadingly implied it was an official primary ticket outlet rather than a second-hand ticket website. Viagogo is also banned from offering a \"100% Guarantee\" claim which the ASA said misleadingly suggested that consumers were guaranteed entry. The ASA's chief executive, Guy Parker, said: \"Many of us will recognise the frustration of being happy with the initial price of tickets on a secondary website only to be stung by hefty fees when we come to book. \"The message from our rulings is simple and it's clear: The price you see at the start should be the price you pay at the end.\" 'Developing transparency'\nA StubHub spokeswoman said: \"As a consumer-first ticket marketplace, StubHub supports any measures which make ticket buying easier, more convenient and more transparent for fans.\" It said it would be \"fully compliant\" with its decision. A spokeswoman for Ticketmaster, which owns Seatwave and GetMeIn, said: \"We will continue to work with both the ASA and the CMA to further develop levels of transparency and consumer protection within the UK ticketing sector.\" Last November, the competition watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), said it would take action against such ticketing websites suspected of breaking consumer law. Last year, Ed Sheeran's promoter, Stuart Galbraith, asked Google to change how it listed secondary sites after Viagogo had paid to be listed top of the Google search, and said wrongly that it was an \"official\" seller of the singer's tickets. Research by the campaign group FanFair Alliance showed that in 77% of searches for popular artists, a secondary website had paid to be top of the Google search result. ",

        "content": "The UK government has announced guidelines to make internet-connected devices safer to use following a spate of security breaches. It includes moves to make sure passwords are unique and not resettable to a factory default and that sensitive data transmitted via apps is encrypted. But the guidelines are not binding, leading some to question how effective they will be. One expert said they would not stop \"irresponsible\" manufacturers. As well as the stricter guidance on passwords and recommended encryption, the government's Security by Design review suggested: The government estimates that every household in the UK owns at least 10 internet-connected devices - a figure that is expected to rise to 15 by 2020. In Germany there is a ban on the sale of smartwatches aimed at children, and the internet-connected doll My Friend Cayla over fears that both could act as spying devices. 'Fast and loose'\nKen Munro, an analyst at security firm Pen Test Partners, said of the review: \"It's a good start but misses too much to be of great use.\" He said: \"Responsible IoT (internet of things) manufacturers are already addressing security. It's the irresponsible manufacturers who aren't interested, don't care about our security or who refuse security on grounds of cost that we need to worry about. \"Without 'teeth', this standard is meaningless. Manufacturers who already play fast and loose with our security to make a quick buck from us won't change anything.\" Mr Munro also revealed that the measures suggested would not have prevented many of the recently reported security breaches of smart devices, such as the Mirai botnet that used internet-connected devices - such as CCTV cameras and printers - to attack popular websites. Margot James, minister for digital and the creative industries, said: \"We want everyone to benefit from the huge potential of internet-connected devices, and it is important they are safe and have a positive impact on people's lives. \"We have worked alongside industry to develop a tough new set of rules so strong security measures are built into everyday technology from the moment it is developed.\" Dr Ian Levy, from the National Cyber Security Centre, which worked on the review, said he hoped the guidelines would act as a \"kitemark\" for such goods. Analysis: By Rory Cellan-Jones, technology correspondent\nFrom internet-connected dolls that can be taught to swear to webcams that can be hacked and enlisted in a botnet, the dangers of this new world where everything is online are becoming evident. What is not so clear is whether this new voluntary code of practice will make any difference. The key word is voluntary. The kind of manufacturers who will sign up to a code are probably pretty responsible already but there are plenty of others whose only aim is to pile their insecure products high and sell them cheap. The new policy will work only if online retailers refuse to stock products that do not comply with the code - yet DCMS (Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport) cannot even say whether Amazon is involved in this initiative. Still, the consumer group Which? has backed the code as a good first step, pleased that there is at least an effort to define what makes a good secure product. Now there will be pressure to give it some teeth by amending consumer protection laws to deal with this new threat to our security. ",

        "content": "US President Donald Trump's top economic adviser Gary Cohn is resigning, the White House has said. It is the latest in a series of high-profile departures from President Trump's team. There has been speculation that Mr Cohn, a supporter of free trade, was angered by Mr Trump's plans to impose tariffs on aluminium and steel imports. In a statement released by the White House, Mr Cohn said it had been \"an honour to serve my country\". The 57-year-old former president of the Goldman Sachs bank helped Mr Trump push through his sweeping tax reforms late last year. However, the two were not believed to be close. In August 2017, Mr Cohn criticised Mr Trump over his reaction to a far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, saying the administration \"can and must do better\". He was reported to have drafted a resignation letter after the event. \"It has been an honour to serve my country and enact pro-growth economic policies to benefit the American people, in particular the passage of historic tax reform,\" Mr Cohn said in his statement. \"I am grateful to the president for giving me this opportunity and wish him and the administration great success in the future.\" Does this herald a new direction?\nAnalysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Gary Cohn was a bit of a stranger in a strange land. He was a Democrat in a Republican White House; an economic globalist working for a president who campaigned on economic nationalism. Now, it seems, Donald Trump's protectionist bent has pushed the top administration economic adviser to the exit. This was not an unexpected development. By many accounts, there had been a contentious White House fight over whether to impose sweeping sanctions on US steel and aluminium imports - a tug-of-war that was settled, precipitously, by the president himself last week. There were the rumours that Mr Cohn was only sticking around to see last year's tax bill over the finish line, after his extreme discomfort following the president's warm words about some of the white nationalist marchers involved in violent clashes in Charlottesville last August. Mr Cohn was reportedly viewed by many Trump loyalists in the White House as an unwelcome interloper. Some on the outside, particularly in the financial world, welcomed him as a moderating influence - along with son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka. Now the former is leaving and the latter two seem greatly weakened. All this could mark sharp new direction in White House policy. The White House said Mr Cohn's exact departure date had yet to be determined. \"For several weeks Gary had been discussing with the president that it was nearing time for him to transition out,\" an official said. In a statement, Mr Trump described his outgoing economics adviser as \"a rare talent\". \"Gary... did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping to deliver historic tax cuts and reforms and unleashing the American economy once again,\" he said . \"He is a rare talent and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people.\" Earlier on Tuesday, President Trump tweeted that there was no chaos at the White House but there were \"still... some people that I want to change\". The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House. Wrong! People will always come & go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos, only great Energy! End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump The White House has seen a string of senior figures leave since Mr Trump took office. Last week, one of his closest aides, Hope Hicks, resigned. She was the fourth person to have served as the president's communications chief. It came a day after she had testified in front of the House Intelligence Committee investigating possible Trump campaign ties to Russia, but White House sources said this was not the reason. ",

        "content": "A UK company has been linked to the laundering of 650,000 stolen bitcoins worth \u00a34.5bn, a BBC Radio 4 investigation has found. The coins were taken by hackers from Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, leaving tens of thousands of customers out of pocket. It's not clear who is in control of the London-based firm Always Efficient LLP. Mt Gox operator Mark Karpeles apologised to investors and said he was co-operating with the investigation. The FBI has charged a Russian national with laundering the stolen bitcoins. Mt Gox matched up those who wanted to buy the crypto-currency with dollars, pounds and other international denominations with those wanting to sell bitcoins, and handled an estimated 70% of the world's Bitcoin trade. The exchange was originally set up to trade cards from a game set in a world of wizards, spells and monsters. When it turned its focus to crypto-currencies, it appeared to be a huge success story. Almost half of Bitcoin trading is done in Japanese yen, and there's even a Japanese girl group, the Virtual Currency Girls, which reflects Japan's growing craze for virtual money. But a group of amateur investigators, WizSec, found that hackers had targeted Mt Gox. They had systematically pilfered users' accounts, hiding their tracks from Mt Gox operators for years. And in 2014, the site's chief executive, Mark Karpeles, made the horrifying discovery that hundreds of thousands of coins were missing. When customers found themselves unable to withdraw funds, the site collapsed. Speaking for the first time about the collapse to BBC Radio 4's File on Four programme, Mr Karpeles said: \"It felt like\u2026 when you fall from a building and you see the ground getting closer, and you feel like you are about to die.\" He said the site had rapidly grown beyond his expectations. \"Mt Gox went from interesting project to being, I would say, a daily nightmare of dealing with banks, governments, people I never knew existed.\" How the coins had gone missing was initially a mystery. But now investigators say almost half the stolen coins from Mt Gox ended up at rival exchange BTC-e. 'Cyber-crime hub'\nThe FBI says BTC-e was a hub for cyber-crime and helped to launder money from hacks, including ransomware attacks of the kind that hit the NHS and other organisations last year. But trying to find out who operates BTC-e isn't easy. The exchange claimed to be operated by a British company called Always Efficient LLP. Always Efficient's registered office is in east London, but the address is shared by several other firms, some of which are thought to be involved in money laundering. Duncan Hames, of anti-corruption group Transparency International, said it's likely to be a shell company. \"People laundering money will set up a network of companies to create layers between the original crime and their attempts to then integrate the proceeds of their crime into the economy,\" he said. \"They simply enable a series of transactions to take place to create this distance and to obscure the trail of the proceeds of crime.\" In an attempt to regulate these so-called shell companies, new rules introduced in June 2016 now stipulate that companies must publish a list of \"persons with significant control\" (PWSC). Always Efficient doesn't currently have a PWSC. The person most recently listed, Alexander Buyanov, is a DJ in a Moscow nightclub. According to Andrei Zakharov, a Russian journalist who tracked him down, Mr Buyanov claims he \"knew nothing\" of the business. Companies House told the BBC it had a dedicated team dealing with PWSCs, and took action when irregularities were identified. 'Real risk' to UK\nThe FBI says the man behind BTC-e is another Russian national, Alexander Vinnik. Documents seen by the BBC detail how the stolen Mt Gox money was laundered through various accounts, usernames and email addresses allegedly controlled by Mr Vinnik. Mr Vinnik was arrested while on holiday in Greece in July 2017, and is currently being detained in Thessaloniki. The US Department of Justice now wants to extradite him to face 21 counts of money laundering and other financial crimes in the US. Mr Zakharov said: \"They were on the beach and his wife was swimming, and when she turned back she saw a lot of people with sunglasses near her husband, and that's how he was arrested.\" Russia has also filed an extradition request for Mr Vinnik on lesser, unrelated charges. The Greek government is now in the process of deciding between the two requests. Via his lawyer, Mr Vinnick told the BBC he denies having any connection to Always Efficient. He added: \"BTC-e is just a web platform for buying and selling Bitcoin - not an exchange. As such it cannot be held responsible for the source of money used to buy Bitcoin, no more than a bureau du change can be held responsible for exchanging a stolen $100 note into pounds sterling.\" A National Crime Agency (NCA) spokesman said it didn't \"routinely confirm or deny investigations\" but recognised \"the very real risks to the UK and the UK's financial sector from large-scale, complex money laundering.\" He added: \"Tackling money laundering is a high priority for the NCA, and we have a number of national and international operations running against the criminals involved, working in close partnership with partners in law enforcement and financial regulation.\" Mark Karpeles was arrested and charged with embezzlement related to payments worth \u00a31.7m. He says these were legitimate loans signed off by an accountant. He's also charged with manipulation of data. He denies all the charges - none of which relates to the loss of the 650,000 bitcoins. He told the BBC he was doing all he could to return funds to customers and added: \"I am very sorry that when I was in charge things happened the way they did.\" 'Unprecedented' rise\nMt Gox is not the only Bitcoin currency exchange to be hacked. Even the Virtual Currency Girls have lost money following another recent Bitcoin exchange theft. Under Japanese bankruptcy law, the remaining 200,000 Mt Gox bitcoins are valued at \u00a3300 each, the price they held when the exchange collapsed in 2014. Since then, the value has increased to around \u00a37,000 each. Many investors are now pushing to see their Mt Gox bitcoins refunded at the current price, and a decision is expected within the next few months. So regardless of the outcome in Mr Vinnik's case, Mt Gox creditors who lost out might still turn a profit, thanks to Bitcoin's unprecedented rise. File on 4: The Missing Bitcoin Billions is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday 11 March at 20:00 GMT and on the iPlayer. ",

        "content": "The air is heavy with the pleasing smell of new shoes as a team of 16 craftsmen slowly and studiously make safari boots. With each pair taking two weeks to produce from start to finish, you can never accuse the Courteney Boot Company of rushing things. Instead the business, one of the world's most exclusive footwear brands, currently makes just 18 pairs of handmade boots and shoes a day. Founded in 1991 in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second city, Courteney continues to be a rare business success story in a country whose economy has struggled greatly over the past 20 years. Using exotic game skin leathers such as crocodile, buffalo, crocodile, hippopotamus and ostrich, its boots remain much in demand around the world. The company was set up by husband and wife team John and Gale Rice. John had started making shoes in the UK in 1953 when aged 15 he began working for British shoe company Clarks. His career then took him to South Africa, before moving to Zimbabwe. The couple ran the business together for 21 years until John died in 2012. Since then Gale has led the company on her own. Looking back on the early days of Courteney she says that she and John devised a novel way to promote the business. \"Right at the beginning we made boots for all the well-known safari operators in Zimbabwe and South Africa free of charge, and delivered most of them ourselves,\" says Gale. \"The safari operators would wear the boots while out in the bush with their overseas clients, and they promoted us - word of mouth.\" The holidaymakers would then find shops in Zimbabwe and South Africa to buy their own pairs of Courteney boots to take home with them at the end of their vacations. In turn they would recommend them to their friends, who would place orders from overseas. Zimbabwe's large commercial farmers, typically white Zimbabweans, also became enthusiastic purchasers of the boots. Gale adds: \"We had three main customers - the hunter, the farmer, and the tourist.\" The company grew strongly until the economic and political meltdown that started in Zimbabwe in 2000 saw the company lose most of its local customers. First, many of the white farmers left the country, and then tourist arrivals declined sharply. To survive Gale focused on increasing exports, which rose from 50% to today's 85% of total sales. \"From the very beginning we always intended to try to make our boots available to our niche market all over the world,\" she says. \"And it is just as well that we did have that strategy. Since 2000 Zimbabwe has deteriorated to almost the brink of collapse. \"For sometime now it has been the case - export or die.\" With global stockists including gun companies such as John Rigby and Westley Richards, Gale says that 70% of its sales are now via the internet, with 20% of that amount via Courteney's own website. Every pair of its $145-492 (\u00a3105-355) boots and shoes are made to order at the company's small workshop, and Gale says that the company will never increase production above 30 pairs per day, so as to maintain quality control. \"I absolutely follow that strategy,\" she says. \"I would say there are several factors to our exporting success, but by far the most important is concentrating on making the best, most comfortable, and durable boot possible. \"Most of our attention goes on getting the product right.\" Explaining the fact that everything is made to order, she adds: \"We are manufacturers not retailers. \"We can't tie up capital by keeping stock, and especially not every style, in every leather, in every colour.\" Fungai Tarirah, a portfolio manager at South Africa-based investment fund Rudiarius Capital Management, says that a key issue any Zimbabwean company has to overcome is the fact that the country is landlocked. \"A fair amount of the challenges faced by Zimbabwean-based exporters are around the fact that the country's a landlocked country, so if your customers are halfway across the world you essentially have to deliver the goods in two legs. \"That sometimes triples or quadruples the amount of paperwork that one has to deal with - but also the lead times.\" Thankfully, Mr Tarirah adds that at the same time the internet has been a \"game changer\" for exporters from countries like Zimbabwe. \"It is now a lot easier for manufacturers to produce in a 'just in time' fashion, as opposed to building up stocks that may or may not move over the next three, six or nine months. \"It allows them to reach larger further-flung markets which they normally could not have accessed.\" Gale says that \"without a doubt our secret to being a successful exporter is attitude\". She adds: \"Shipping overseas seamlessly takes a lot of communication and patience and attention to detail.\" While domestic sales are slowly rising again since former president Robert Mugabe resigned back in November, Gale says it is still not easy to be a business in Zimbabwe. \"Life is very difficult here, but we choose to focus on the positive and keep our heads down. We know what we have to do.\" ",

        "content": "If children can't get to lessons, a project in rural Cambodia is showing how lessons can be brought to them. Tuk- tuks, the motorised rickshaws used across south-east Asia, are delivering textbooks and lessons to remote villages in a scheme known as \"Book Book Tuk-Tuk\". It can be difficult and expensive for students to get an education in rural Cambodia and a school in Takhmau, south of Phnom Penh is experimenting with taking lessons directly to them. Kuma Cambodia, a school founded in 2012 by the Norwegian Association for Private Initiative in Cambodia (NAPIC), decided to dispatch libraries on wheels to remote areas, to bring books to rural children. The Book Book Tuk Tuk project, working with village chiefs to encourage participation, sends out tuk-tuks staffed by Cambodian volunteers, many of whom are just out of school themselves. They educate families about why it's important to send children to school, as well as addressing social issues such as HIV awareness and concerns about gambling. 'Cycle of poverty'\nVolunteer Pring Mean, a 21-year-old Cambodian, explained: \"Not letting children go to school is common among the poorest. \"Parents do not understand the value of education, family income is too low and so children need to work or look after young siblings, or parents suffer from drugs or alcohol addiction,\" says Mean. \"When children aren't sent to school they're more vulnerable to exploitation and getting involved in drugs or crime. Without access to education they remain in the cycle of poverty.\" The tuk-tuk volunteers teach children maths, how to draw, read, sing, and tell them traditional Cambodian stories. Although the libraries provide access to literature and advice, their primary function is to encourage parents to send their children to school. Seavsean, a 10-year-old Cambodian girl, lived under a plastic sheet with her parents and brother in a rural village in Kandal province. Her father gambled away the family's earnings, leaving her mother to sneak out at night to steal rice to feed her children. But after participating in the parent programme at Book Book Tuk Tuk, Seavsean's father stopped drinking and got a job. Now, they live in a brick house, and Seavsean attends school at Kuma Cambodia. \"We believe giving parents more knowledge, hope and motivation to help them change their destructive behaviour - like gambling, drug abuse or domestic violence - and break the cycle for their children,\" said Pring Mean. But Book Book Tuk Tuk isn't the only classroom taking to the road to reach children. Teaching English by video\nIn Indonesia, a lack of qualified English language teachers means many students' future employment prospects are limited. Children in low-income, rural areas have little or no access to English language teaching, while unreliable, expensive internet access rules out online learning. So three organisations, Oxford University Press (OUP), car group IndoMobil and US teaching network Eleutian, combined forces to kit out trucks with satellite technology, linking Indonesian students with US-based teachers. The trucks are driven to low-income communities across the country, park somewhere open - such as a playground - and set up. The side of the truck folds away to reveal a large TV screen, with shade from the sun and rain, and students learn from OUP's syllabus from a teacher leading the class in real time from the US. \"English proficiency is becoming increasingly important in developing countries, says OUP's Joseph Noble. \"This is particularly true in Indonesia. However, many students are being left behind. Since its inception, the TeachCast project has reached more than a thousand students, and has plans to expand its current fleet of 15 trucks to 500, with each truck teaching 150 students per day. More from Global education The editor of Global education is sean.coughlan@bbc.co.uk Floating schools\nIn Bangladesh, much of the country is prone to flooding, classrooms on wheels aren't always a viable option. Flooding severely impacts children's education, adding to the country's four million children who are already out of school. \"Schools struggle against floods and riverbank erosion,\" says Mohammed Rezwan, executive director of non-profit organisation Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha. \"The river is known as the 'destroyer of establishments'. \"Schooling opportunities are already very limited for the extremely poor, and when roads become impassable during the monsoon, students can't trek to school. \"School dropouts are common in these rural regions,\" he says. Rezwan's family owned a small boat, meaning he could attend school during monsoon season, and Rezwan was inspired to create \"floating schools\". \"I thought if children couldn't come to school, then the school should come to them.\" The organisation now owns 22 school boats, and educates nearly 2,000 children, who are collected from various riverside villages throughout the day. After the boat docks at its final destination, class begins. Each boat is equipped with solar powered electricity, a laptop, and a classroom for 30 students. Seven-year-old Suraiya Khatun, from Pabna likes this form of mobile learning. \"When I'm older I want to be a floating school teacher to teach children in our village,\" she says. ",

        "content": "Six months after the worst hurricane in living memory brought devastation to the Caribbean, there are still UK citizens sleeping in a government shelter with nowhere to call home. In the middle of a basketball gymnasium, Stanton \"Mikey\" Robinson, 30, sat with all of his worldly possessions. Fighting back tears he explained his dream of having a small apartment with a small table and a single bed. \"I don't like it in here. I don't feel comfortable in this place,\" he told us. \"(tell the government to) Please help me.\" Twenty metres away on what's meant to be spectator seating, Makeba Hesky, 34, sat nursing her 10-month-old child. A large hole - unpatched since the hurricane - in the roof of the BVI Sports Complex allowed rain and light to pour into the otherwise unlit gymnasium. \"It seems to me like everybody just give up on us,\" Hesky said. Hesky and Robinson are among the approximately 20 people still living in the shelter who have faced repeated deadlines to move out despite nowhere to go. Many more are living with friends and family. Outside the sports complex and across the islands, signs of Irma's (destructive) visit can still be seen everywhere - not least at the island's government building. Most of the structure's windows are boarded, awaiting replacement. Inside, the island's premier, Orlando Smith, works from a sparse office while repairmen are still labouring to repair the extensive damage. Asked if he could guarantee that those in the shelter would not be thrown out with nowhere to go, Smith told the BBC, \"that's why they're still there\u2026 we're looking to provide the necessary accommodation for them\". The \"biggest priority is housing - getting those roofs back on, getting people in homes,\" he said, speaking outside his office. \"Then of course, there is the matter of the economy. We've got to get that economy back up and running.\" Economically speaking, the islands' tourism sector took the biggest hit. Few know that better than Roselyn Hill. She like many others here worked in the tourism industry for decades, only to be laid off when Irma damaged the resorts and attractions at which they worked. \"Peak season a couple of years ago - sometimes it looks like more boats than water. You can't see the water for the yachts,\" she said, standing on a cruise ship dock that (now lies) laid empty. Two of the biggest cruise companies have stopped bringing ships to the BVI, and the reduced numbers of tourists has meant a slow recovery for the tourism industry. \"It's not a good feeling you know back then to compare it to now,\" she said. \"When we see a cruise ship, it's like light\". The hardships have caused many to question whether the United Kingdom did enough to support those on the islands. Across town, Rita Plunkett was doing her washing on a day off. Stepping inside, she explained how windows and doors to her home were broken during the storm and pointed to massive water damage to a bedroom ceiling. On the roof of her apartment building, bits of UK Aid-branded tarpaulin stood between her and regular rainstorms. She said the UK's response came up short. She received, \"no aid, apart from the six bottles of water I got - that was it,\" she said. It was a common perception we have heard here over the past few days - that other than the work done by British troops in the month after the storm, more could have been done. Upon returning from a preaching trip to the island of Virgin Gorda, Bishop John Cline went a step further than most we spoke with. \"When we did need them to show that we are truly a child of the United Kingdom, I think they disappointed us,\" he said. \"It changed our view in terms of a relationship, to saying 'are we really a part of you or is that just in name only?'\" But the island's British governor, Gus Jaspert, says he's proud of the UK's contribution to the BVI's recovery - noting that much of Britain's work has been behind the scenes. \"The UK had a very first visible phase, which was military out and about. People saw that a lot more,\" he said. \"Behind the scenes, the UK has been supporting with infrastructure, supporting with technical advisors in each of the key departments and ministries\u2026 as well as grants on specific projects - both on immediate needs, but also on longer term. \"(Together) we've got the electricity back on. We've got businesses back open. We've got all children getting educated, and key services are back up and running,\" he said, while acknowledging that much work still remained. The governor is right about progress being made. Given the scale of the destruction even removing debris has been a huge feat, albeit one that is still ongoing. The island's main high school lies in ruin. Many other schools appear damaged. Harbours are littered with overturned and abandoned boats - some boats lay where they washed up on land. Roads are littered with potholes. And some debris remains strewn about. And now, with hurricane season less than 100 days away, many island residents are worried about what the next storm may bring.

        "content": "A US lawmaker investigating alleged Russian election meddling says an ex-Trump aide should testify on wild claims he has made about the president. Mr Nunberg said Mr Trump was aware of a 2016 meeting between his aides and a Russian lawyer, and may have \"done something\" during the campaign. Democrat Adam Schiff responded by saying his congressional panel \"needs to explore\" Mr Nunberg's allegation. Mr Nunberg is the latest figure to become embroiled in the Russia inquiry. \"Certainly if Mr Nunberg has light to shed about what the president knew about the Trump Tower meeting, we would like to find out,\" Mr Schiff said, referring to his House Intelligence Committee's investigation on Monday night. US President Donald Trump has denied any knowledge of that meeting, which has become a central focus of a separate inquiry by special counsel Robert Mueller into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin. Congressman Mike Conway, who serves as leading chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, dismissed the idea of calling Mr Nunberg to testify, saying of the Trump Tower meeting: \"I think we've pretty much explored that to death.\" Mr Nunberg told the New York Daily News on Tuesday he is contemplating seeking treatment for alcohol abuse, a day after his extraordinary series of interviews on live television. He complained to US media on Monday about being asked to share his email conversations with a long list of ex-campaign aides in response to a subpoena from Mr Mueller's team. The political operative, who helped launch Donald Trump's presidential campaign before losing his job in 2015, said in a round of media interviews at first he would not comply with Mr Mueller's demand to testify before a grand jury. But he later told the Associated Press he would probably end up complying. \"I think it would be really, really funny if they wanted to arrest me because I don't want to spend 80 hours going over emails,\" he told MSNBC. While he thought investigators believed they had something on Mr Trump, he argued that the subpoena was unfair and added he would like Robert Mueller's team to narrow its scope of inquiry. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders would not be drawn on Mr Nunberg's remarks, saying: \"I'm not going to weigh in on somebody that doesn't work at the White House.\" Who is Nunberg?\nSam Nunberg worked on the Trump campaign in 2015 until he was fired in August that year over racially charged Facebook posts. He was later sued by Mr Trump for $10m (\u00a37.2m) for breach of confidentiality. The lawsuit was \"amicably settled\" out of court, a lawyer for the Trump Organization said at the time. 'He knew' about Trump Tower meeting\nMr Nunberg said Mr Trump was aware at the time of a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower when a group of Russians offered his campaign staff damaging information about Hillary Clinton. \"You know he knew about it,\" Mr Nunberg told CNN. \"He was talking about it a week before. I don't know why he went around trying to hide it.\" The White House has repeatedly denied Mr Trump knew anything about that meeting. 'Arrest me'\nDuring Monday's interviews with US media, Mr Nunberg said he had met Mr Mueller's team for five-and-a-half hours over the weekend. He said he would not appear before a grand jury to testify on Friday. \"I'm not co-operating. Arrest me,\" Mr Nunberg said on live television. \"You want to arrest me? Arrest me.\" 'They suspect something'\nAt times during the interviews, Mr Nunberg appeared to contradict himself. He said: \"Trump may very well have done something during the election with the Russians. If he did that, I don't know.\" But Mr Nunberg also told CNN's Jake Tapper: \"It's the biggest joke to ever think Donald Trump colluded with the Russians.\" ",

        "content": "A deal to rescue The Weinstein Company from bankruptcy has collapsed at the last minute. Businesswoman Maria Contreras-Sweet had led a team that was poised to buy the struggling film production and distribution company. However, the deal was reportedly terminated after it was found the firm's debt was $280m (\u00a3201.4m) rather than the $225m previously disclosed. The company was co-founded by disgraced US movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. Mr Weinstein is facing dozens of allegations of sexual abuse, including rape, but he denies non-consensual sex. Last week, it was revealed the investor group led by Ms Contreras-Sweet - who led the US Small Business Administration under President Barack Obama, - was set to pay $500m for the company's assets. That figure included a $90m victims' compensation fund. \"After signing and entering into the confirmatory diligence phase, we have received disappointing information about the viability of completing this transaction,\" said Ms Contreras-Sweet. The deal would have seen the new owners launch a company with a board of directors made up of a majority of independent women. Ms Contreras-Sweet would have been chairwoman of the business. It would also have saved about 150 jobs. Prior to the deal, The Weinstein Company said it would file for bankruptcy. Ms Contreras-Sweet said: \"We will consider acquiring assets that may become available in the event of bankruptcy proceedings, as well as other opportunities that may become available in the entertainment industry.\" ",

        "content": "The air is heavy with the pleasing smell of new shoes as a team of 16 craftsmen slowly and studiously make safari boots. With each pair taking two weeks to produce from start to finish, you can never accuse the Courteney Boot Company of rushing things. Instead the business, one of the world's most exclusive footwear brands, currently makes just 18 pairs of handmade boots and shoes a day. Founded in 1991 in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second city, Courteney continues to be a rare business success story in a country whose economy has struggled greatly over the past 20 years. Using exotic game skin leathers such as crocodile, buffalo, crocodile, hippopotamus and ostrich, its boots remain much in demand around the world. The company was set up by husband and wife team John and Gale Rice. John had started making shoes in the UK in 1953 when aged 15 he began working for British shoe company Clarks. His career then took him to South Africa, before moving to Zimbabwe. The couple ran the business together for 21 years until John died in 2012. Since then Gale has led the company on her own. Looking back on the early days of Courteney she says that she and John devised a novel way to promote the business. \"Right at the beginning we made boots for all the well-known safari operators in Zimbabwe and South Africa free of charge, and delivered most of them ourselves,\" says Gale. \"The safari operators would wear the boots while out in the bush with their overseas clients, and they promoted us - word of mouth.\" The holidaymakers would then find shops in Zimbabwe and South Africa to buy their own pairs of Courteney boots to take home with them at the end of their vacations. In turn they would recommend them to their friends, who would place orders from overseas. Zimbabwe's large commercial farmers, typically white Zimbabweans, also became enthusiastic purchasers of the boots. Gale adds: \"We had three main customers - the hunter, the farmer, and the tourist.\" The company grew strongly until the economic and political meltdown that started in Zimbabwe in 2000 saw the company lose most of its local customers. First, many of the white farmers left the country, and then tourist arrivals declined sharply. To survive Gale focused on increasing exports, which rose from 50% to today's 85% of total sales. \"From the very beginning we always intended to try to make our boots available to our niche market all over the world,\" she says. \"And it is just as well that we did have that strategy. Since 2000 Zimbabwe has deteriorated to almost the brink of collapse. \"For sometime now it has been the case - export or die.\" With global stockists including gun companies such as John Rigby and Westley Richards, Gale says that 70% of its sales are now via the internet, with 20% of that amount via Courteney's own website. Every pair of its $145-492 (\u00a3105-355) boots and shoes are made to order at the company's small workshop, and Gale says that the company will never increase production above 30 pairs per day, so as to maintain quality control. \"I absolutely follow that strategy,\" she says. \"I would say there are several factors to our exporting success, but by far the most important is concentrating on making the best, most comfortable, and durable boot possible. \"Most of our attention goes on getting the product right.\" Explaining the fact that everything is made to order, she adds: \"We are manufacturers not retailers. \"We can't tie up capital by keeping stock, and especially not every style, in every leather, in every colour.\" Fungai Tarirah, a portfolio manager at South Africa-based investment fund Rudiarius Capital Management, says that a key issue any Zimbabwean company has to overcome is the fact that the country is landlocked. \"A fair amount of the challenges faced by Zimbabwean-based exporters are around the fact that the country's a landlocked country, so if your customers are halfway across the world you essentially have to deliver the goods in two legs. \"That sometimes triples or quadruples the amount of paperwork that one has to deal with - but also the lead times.\" Thankfully, Mr Tarirah adds that at the same time the internet has been a \"game changer\" for exporters from countries like Zimbabwe. \"It is now a lot easier for manufacturers to produce in a 'just in time' fashion, as opposed to building up stocks that may or may not move over the next three, six or nine months. \"It allows them to reach larger further-flung markets which they normally could not have accessed.\" Gale says that \"without a doubt our secret to being a successful exporter is attitude\". She adds: \"Shipping overseas seamlessly takes a lot of communication and patience and attention to detail.\" While domestic sales are slowly rising again since former president Robert Mugabe resigned back in November, Gale says it is still not easy to be a business in Zimbabwe. \"Life is very difficult here, but we choose to focus on the positive and keep our heads down. We know what we have to do.\" ",

        "content": "If children can't get to lessons, a project in rural Cambodia is showing how lessons can be brought to them. Tuk- tuks, the motorised rickshaws used across south-east Asia, are delivering textbooks and lessons to remote villages in a scheme known as \"Book Book Tuk-Tuk\". It can be difficult and expensive for students to get an education in rural Cambodia and a school in Takhmau, south of Phnom Penh is experimenting with taking lessons directly to them. Kuma Cambodia, a school founded in 2012 by the Norwegian Association for Private Initiative in Cambodia (NAPIC), decided to dispatch libraries on wheels to remote areas, to bring books to rural children. The Book Book Tuk Tuk project, working with village chiefs to encourage participation, sends out tuk-tuks staffed by Cambodian volunteers, many of whom are just out of school themselves. They educate families about why it's important to send children to school, as well as addressing social issues such as HIV awareness and concerns about gambling. 'Cycle of poverty'\nVolunteer Pring Mean, a 21-year-old Cambodian, explained: \"Not letting children go to school is common among the poorest. \"Parents do not understand the value of education, family income is too low and so children need to work or look after young siblings, or parents suffer from drugs or alcohol addiction,\" says Mean. \"When children aren't sent to school they're more vulnerable to exploitation and getting involved in drugs or crime. Without access to education they remain in the cycle of poverty.\" The tuk-tuk volunteers teach children maths, how to draw, read, sing, and tell them traditional Cambodian stories. Although the libraries provide access to literature and advice, their primary function is to encourage parents to send their children to school. Seavsean, a 10-year-old Cambodian girl, lived under a plastic sheet with her parents and brother in a rural village in Kandal province. Her father gambled away the family's earnings, leaving her mother to sneak out at night to steal rice to feed her children. But after participating in the parent programme at Book Book Tuk Tuk, Seavsean's father stopped drinking and got a job. Now, they live in a brick house, and Seavsean attends school at Kuma Cambodia. \"We believe giving parents more knowledge, hope and motivation to help them change their destructive behaviour - like gambling, drug abuse or domestic violence - and break the cycle for their children,\" said Pring Mean. But Book Book Tuk Tuk isn't the only classroom taking to the road to reach children. Teaching English by video\nIn Indonesia, a lack of qualified English language teachers means many students' future employment prospects are limited. Children in low-income, rural areas have little or no access to English language teaching, while unreliable, expensive internet access rules out online learning. So three organisations, Oxford University Press (OUP), car group IndoMobil and US teaching network Eleutian, combined forces to kit out trucks with satellite technology, linking Indonesian students with US-based teachers. The trucks are driven to low-income communities across the country, park somewhere open - such as a playground - and set up. The side of the truck folds away to reveal a large TV screen, with shade from the sun and rain, and students learn from OUP's syllabus from a teacher leading the class in real time from the US. \"English proficiency is becoming increasingly important in developing countries, says OUP's Joseph Noble. \"This is particularly true in Indonesia. However, many students are being left behind. Since its inception, the TeachCast project has reached more than a thousand students, and has plans to expand its current fleet of 15 trucks to 500, with each truck teaching 150 students per day. More from Global education The editor of Global education is sean.coughlan@bbc.co.uk Floating schools\nIn Bangladesh, much of the country is prone to flooding, classrooms on wheels aren't always a viable option. Flooding severely impacts children's education, adding to the country's four million children who are already out of school. \"Schools struggle against floods and riverbank erosion,\" says Mohammed Rezwan, executive director of non-profit organisation Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha. \"The river is known as the 'destroyer of establishments'. \"Schooling opportunities are already very limited for the extremely poor, and when roads become impassable during the monsoon, students can't trek to school. \"School dropouts are common in these rural regions,\" he says. Rezwan's family owned a small boat, meaning he could attend school during monsoon season, and Rezwan was inspired to create \"floating schools\". \"I thought if children couldn't come to school, then the school should come to them.\" The organisation now owns 22 school boats, and educates nearly 2,000 children, who are collected from various riverside villages throughout the day. After the boat docks at its final destination, class begins. Each boat is equipped with solar powered electricity, a laptop, and a classroom for 30 students. Seven-year-old Suraiya Khatun, from Pabna likes this form of mobile learning. \"When I'm older I want to be a floating school teacher to teach children in our village,\" she says. ",

        "content": "On Thursday it will be four years since Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 disappeared. With the mystery still unsolved, some relatives of passengers have criticised plans for a memorial in Australia. The memorial is scheduled to be completed in Perth, on the west coast, by September. According to the Australian government, the site will honour the 239 people on board when the plane went missing in 2014. It is also designed to recognise Australia's role in the failed recovery mission. However, some relatives have condemned the idea of a memorial when the plane has not been found. They also fear it could become a tourist attraction - or a curse - and argue they should have been better consulted. 'Absolutely ridiculous'\nA proposal for an Australian-based tribute was first floated in 2014, but it was not authorised by the government until last year. Australian Danica Weeks, whose husband Paul was on the flight, said she was blindsided by a recent email that said the memorial's design was up for tender. \"No-one was consulted. It's absolutely ridiculous,\" she said. \"We haven't found the plane yet, so why are we having a memorial?\" For her, the memorial represents Australian authorities \"closing the chapter\" on the missing flight, even as a privately funded search continues. \"They're just doing it for their own benefit,\" she told the BBC. \"I hate to say it, but it's just obviously a tourist attraction.\" Jeanette Maguire, the daughter of Cathy and Bob Lawton, said she appreciated the gesture but it was ill-advised. \"There's no point in having a memorial when we can't get past 'where are they?'\" she said. \"We want you to spend the time and effort on actually finding them.\" Both families said they had received little information on what the memorial might look like, or include. Authorities have said it will be built in a central, easily accessible island on the Swan River in Perth. The city was the base for the official search by Australia, Malaysia and China in the southern Indian Ocean. More than two-thirds of those on board were from China, which lies more than 5,000km (3,100 miles) from Perth. Jiang Hui, whose mother Jiang Cuiyun was on board, said he believed that distance would prevent Chinese families from visiting the site. But Mr Jiang said he was also most angered by a memorial pre-dating the discovery of the plane. \"In the eyes of the Chinese, a monument can only be erected after it is confirmed that person is dead,\" said Mr Jiang, who acts as a representative for several Chinese MH370 families. \"Maybe you don't understand Asian people's customs. If you haven't found the people, the monument is like putting a curse on them.\" He also accused Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of keeping Chinese families in the dark. He said Chinese relatives only found out about the memorial from media reports. Chinese families wrote an open letter to the Australian government in January, calling for the project to be cancelled, and asking to be consulted on future plans. They have not received a response. When asked by the BBC about such opposition, the Australian government said it had consulted Australian families and they would \"continue to be engaged during the design process\". The government did not respond to a question about non-Australian families. The state government of Western Australia (WA), which is funding half of the project, said it had raised relatives' concerns with Canberra. \"The WA Government understands the sensitivities, and expected consultation with families of those missing to be very thorough,\" a spokesman said. Design interest\nA public tender for the A$126,000 (\u00a370,000; $98,000) memorial, which closed on 31 January, attracted many submissions from local and international artists, the state government said. Artists were asked to design a site that helps \"reflect upon personal loss while engendering a sense of peace\". The tender noted the island site was carefully selected because \"the connection with the water is significant\". The tender also said designs should respect \"Chinese cultural sensitivities\". It advised that MH370 passengers should be referred to as \"those lost\" rather than \"those who died\", and not include a list of names. The successful design is expected to be revealed in April and be built by September. Wait continues\nBy then, the outcome of the privately funded Ocean Infinity search for the plane will also be known. Malaysia has confirmed the search, which began in January, will conclude in June. \"I hope they are successful in finding the plane, and the answers that we so desperately need four years on,\" Ms Weeks said. \"We deserve the right to have a proper goodbye.\" ",

        "content": "Former Indian cricket captain Sourav Ganguly has released a memoir which chronicles his achievements, disappointments and controversies. The BBC's Vikas Pandey spoke to him in Delhi. Ganguly is considered to be one of the best captains in international cricket. His aggressive form of leadership heralded a new era in Indian cricket and helped the team secure many memorable wins at home and overseas in the early 2000s. He didn't mince his words during his tenure as the captain - an approach that won him plaudits but also sparked controversies. One would expect his memoir to be revelatory and aggressive. But critics say \"A Century Is Not Enough\" is neither. You will be disappointed if you are expecting revelations about some of the biggest scandals and controversies in Indian cricket. But it's a treat for fans who want to know more about the former captain's approach to the game and life. It tells the story of a man who faced several struggles, betrayals and setbacks on his way to sporting greatness. Unexpected captaincy\nLegendary batsman Sachin Tendulkar unexpectedly gave up captaincy in 2000, paving the way for Ganguly to take over. That was the same year a match-fixing scandal involving several Indian and South African players came to light - they were accused of taking bribes to underperform. Ganguly writes that this was a \"very critical stage in Indian cricket\". \"The dark days of the match-fixing era were slowly being revealed. The unit was battered and demoralised. I knew my job was going to be tough,\" he writes. The memoir, however, doesn't go into more details about the scandal. Ganguly says that was deliberate. \"This book is for a different purpose. When I write a biography someday, I may talk about it,\" he says. Despite the scandal, Ganguly's captaincy started on a winning note and he went on to win many more tournaments for India. Many credit him for turning relatively inexperienced players into a match-winning unit. He says he followed a simple formula for success. \"I picked talented players from all parts of the country. And I backed them and gave them enough space. The main thing was taking the fear of failure and insecurity away from them,\" he says. The beginning of mind games\nIndian cricket changed forever in 2001 after the team snatched a victory from the jaws of defeat against a formidable Australian side led by maverick captain Steve Waugh at Eden Gardens in Kolkata (Formerly Calcutta). VVS Laxman scored a brilliant 281 to help India recover from a follow on to win the game. Ganguly describes the match as \"arguably the greatest Test played in India\". The match also marked a shift in the attitudes of Indian players. The players stood up to the notorious Australian sledging and gave the tourists a taste of their own medicine. Ganguly in fact, infamously made Waugh wait for the toss. \"Cricket is a game that needs mental strength. When you get an opportunity to get into the mind of the opposition, you take it,\" he says. But this attitude was reserved for the games. \"Off the field I was docile, introverted, a little withdrawn. I became aggressive on the field.\" 'A massive drop'\nGanguly had a very public falling out with coach Greg Chappell in in 2005, which he describes as the main reason behind his removal from captaincy. He was eventually dropped from the team as well. He has described the incident as \"unthinkable, unacceptable and a massive drop\". \"History hasn't recorded many instances of a winning captain dropped so unceremoniously, that too after scoring a hundred in the last Test series,\" he writes. Ganguly eventually made a comeback to the side as a player after scoring well in several domestic tournaments. The book gives great insights into his mindset during that time. \"It was not easy playing in front of half empty galleries, staying in hotels which offered little comfort, playing against opposition teams which were light years away from the international standard,\" he writes. \"You get dropped when you are not playing well. But I was playing well and scoring runs and wasn't being picked. That was a bit of a scare,\" he says. \"It was a tough situation, but there was no option but keep playing cricket and scoring runs. I had tremendous belief in my abilities and I worked hard. And that's what I tell youngsters in cricket or any other profession, soak in pressure and work hard,\" he says. ",

        "content": "US President Donald Trump's top economic adviser Gary Cohn is resigning, the White House has said. It is the latest in a series of high-profile departures from President Trump's team. There has been speculation that Mr Cohn, a supporter of free trade, was angered by Mr Trump's plans to impose tariffs on aluminium and steel imports. In a statement released by the White House, Mr Cohn said it had been \"an honour to serve my country\". The 57-year-old former president of the Goldman Sachs bank helped Mr Trump push through his sweeping tax reforms late last year. However, the two were not believed to be close. In August 2017, Mr Cohn criticised Mr Trump over his reaction to a far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, saying the administration \"can and must do better\". He was reported to have drafted a resignation letter after the event. \"It has been an honour to serve my country and enact pro-growth economic policies to benefit the American people, in particular the passage of historic tax reform,\" Mr Cohn said in his statement. \"I am grateful to the president for giving me this opportunity and wish him and the administration great success in the future.\" Does this herald a new direction?\nAnalysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Gary Cohn was a bit of a stranger in a strange land. He was a Democrat in a Republican White House; an economic globalist working for a president who campaigned on economic nationalism. Now, it seems, Donald Trump's protectionist bent has pushed the top administration economic adviser to the exit. This was not an unexpected development. By many accounts, there had been a contentious White House fight over whether to impose sweeping sanctions on US steel and aluminium imports - a tug-of-war that was settled, precipitously, by the president himself last week. There were the rumours that Mr Cohn was only sticking around to see last year's tax bill over the finish line, after his extreme discomfort following the president's warm words about some of the white nationalist marchers involved in violent clashes in Charlottesville last August. Mr Cohn was reportedly viewed by many Trump loyalists in the White House as an unwelcome interloper. Some on the outside, particularly in the financial world, welcomed him as a moderating influence - along with son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka. Now the former is leaving and the latter two seem greatly weakened. All this could mark sharp new direction in White House policy. The White House said Mr Cohn's exact departure date had yet to be determined. \"For several weeks Gary had been discussing with the president that it was nearing time for him to transition out,\" an official said. In a statement, Mr Trump described his outgoing economics adviser as \"a rare talent\". \"Gary... did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping to deliver historic tax cuts and reforms and unleashing the American economy once again,\" he said . \"He is a rare talent and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people.\" Mr Trump later tweeted that he would pick Mr Cohn's replacement \"soon\". \"Many people wanting the job - will choose wisely!\" he added. Possible candidates mooted by US media include White House adviser Peter Navarro and Larry Kudlow, a conservative commentator and 2016 campaign adviser. Earlier on Tuesday, President Trump tweeted that there was no chaos at the White House but there were \"still... some people that I want to change\". The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House. Wrong! People will always come & go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos, only great Energy! End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump The White House has seen a string of senior figures leave since Mr Trump took office. Last week, one of his closest aides, Hope Hicks, resigned. She was the fourth person to have served as the president's communications chief. It came a day after she had testified in front of the House Intelligence Committee investigating possible Trump campaign ties to Russia, but White House sources said this was not the reason. ",

        "content": "Britain's carbon emissions have sunk to the level last seen in 1890 \u2013 the year before penalties were first awarded in football. In 2017, CO\u2082 emissions from fossil fuels fell by 2.6%. This was mainly driven by a 19% decline in coal use. It follows a 5.8% fall in 2016, which saw a record 52% drop in coal use, according to the green website Carbon Brief. The figure is doubly striking as emissions from cars have been going up. The analysis is based on government energy-use figures. The government will publish its own CO\u2082 estimates later in March. Last year, Carbon Brief's preliminary assessment of CO\u2082 proved accurate. This year\u2019s shows that the UK's total CO\u2082 emissions are currently 38% below 1990 levels. They have been decreasing steadily since 2012, with big falls in 2014 and 2016. The decline continued in 2017. Oil and petroleum use increased slightly, though not enough to offset the falls in CO\u2082 associated with other fuels. Vehicles in reverse\nLeo Hickman, editor of Carbon Brief, told BBC News: \"The data highlights the dramatic impact that the rapid decline of coal-fired power plants is having on the UK's emissions. \"The drop was not as pronounced as in 2016, but in 2017 coal was joined by a fall in the use of gas due to a milder winter.\" But he warned: \"If the UK is to meet its climate targets over the next few decades, this rate of decline will need to be maintained, even accelerated. \"Action will need to be focused on the transport and building sectors, where emission reductions remain elusive.\" Vehicles are a creating a real CO\u2082 headache for the government, with average emissions for new cars rising for first time since 2000. The motor industry blamed the public backlash against diesel vehicles driven by concerns about local air pollution. But environmentalists said it was also caused by a manufacturing trend towards SUVs. Tax incentives\nAlex Buttle, from the website Motorway.co.uk, said: \"Clearly, the government hasn't thought through the environmental impact of their anti-diesel campaign.\u201d He called for new tax breaks for electric and hydrogen cars. But Paul Morozzo, from Greenpeace, told BBC News: \"SUV sales have had more of an impact on average CO\u2082 emissions than the shift away from diesel. \"The industry just isn't doing enough to tackle either carbon or air pollution from its vehicles.\" Another key factor is a change in tax policy. Previously, low-emissions vehicles used to be rewarded by zero car tax, but in 2015 the then Chancellor George Osborne lumped everything but electric and hydrogen cars into the same tax band. That left the owner of a Porsche paying the same as the owner of a Toyota Prius. The head of the AA, Edmund King, forecast at the time: \"This is really counter-productive. Drivers will not be given the same incentive to go for cleaner cars, so there won't be the same pressure on manufacturers to produce those cleaner models.\" It appears he was right.

        "content": "Australia and East Timor have signed a historic treaty on a permanent maritime border in the Timor Sea. The deal ends a decade-long dispute between the neighbours over rights to the sea's rich oil and gas reserves. East Timor, one of the world's poorest nations, will now gain the majority of any future revenue. The countries signed the deal at the UN headquarters in New York, after negotiations in the international court of arbitration. UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres praised the \"vision and determination\" of both nations in achieving the agreement. How did conflict arise?\nAfter East Timor, also known as Timor-Leste, gained independence from Indonesia in 2002, no permanent maritime boundary was established between Australia and the new nation. Instead, the two sides agreed on a temporary boundary, but East Timor later argued that deal had been unfairly forced upon them. It believed its more powerful neighbour had an unfairly large share of access to oil and gas fields that are estimated to be worth tens of billions of dollars. In 2016, East Timor contested the arrangements in the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague. Mediation between the nations concluded last week. What is in the new deal?\nThe landmark treaty sets out the maritime border at the midway point between the countries, in line with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Australia had pushed for a border at the edge its continental shelf, which would have put the boundary closer to East Timor. The new deal means East Timor will receive at least 70% of the largest oil field, Greater Sunrise, which is worth an estimated $40bn (\u00a328bn; A$51bn). Previously, revenue was to be split evenly between the countries. Australia will lose its jurisdiction in oil fields currently shared by both nations. How did each nation react?\nAustralian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said her nation had an \"enduring interest\" in East Timor's prosperity, acknowledging the treaty as an important step. \"As good friends and close neighbours, we want Timor Leste to achieve its economic potential,\" she said. It was \"momentous day\" for East Timor, said Augusto Cabral Pereira, Deputy Minister of the Prime Minister for the Delimitation of Borders. What will happen now?\nThe new deal is a big win for East Timor, which relies heavily on oil and gas for its economy, but had been running out of resources.. The Greater Sunrise oil field is yet to be mined, with a consortium of miners blaming delays on the long-running border dispute. Canberra had faced accusations it was colluding with oil companies to have gas processed in Australia, according to media reports - an assertion Ms Bishop denied. Under the agreement, East Timor will receive a greater slice of revenue - 80% - if gas is processed in Australia. ",

        "content": "A BBC journalist has alleged that she was sexually harassed by the senior Russian politician Leonid Slutsky. BBC Russian Service's Farida Rustamova is the third journalist to openly accuse him of improper behaviour. The Duma deputy denied the accusations and has threatened to take the women to court for defamation. Russia has not seen the same backlash against sexual harassment as the US and Western Europe have seen in the wake of high profile scandals. 'Lost for words'\nMs Rustamova recorded audio of the incident, which took place a year ago. The recording is in the BBC's possession, but it has decided not to publish it. On 24 March 2017, Farida Rustamova visited Leonid Slutsky at his parliamentary office to get a comment about the then French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen's visit to Russia. During the conversation, Mr Slutsky unexpectedly changed the subject and asked if she would like to leave the BBC to work for him. When Ms Rustamova refused, he complained: \"You're trying to get away from me, you don't want to kiss me, you've hurt my feelings.\" In the recording, Ms Rustamova can be heard explaining that she has a boyfriend that she hopes to marry. \"Great, you'll be his wife, and my mistress,\" Mr Slutsky says. Our correspondent says the politician then approached her and, in her words, began \"running his hand, the flat of his palm, up against my nether region\". Sexual harassment in Russia\n\"I didn't understand what had happened,\" Ms Rustamova says. \"I was just lost for words, muttering funny noises, I just went numb. I blurted out something about not coming to him again, that he had felt me up.\" Judging by his response, which was also caught on the recording, Mr Slutsky did not agree with her description of events. \"I don't feel people up. Well, OK, just a little. 'Feel people up' is an ugly expression,\" he said. The BBC has asked Mr Slutsky to comment on the events of 24 March 2017, but he has not responded. Ms Rustamova joins two journalists - TV channel RTVI deputy editor Yekaterina Kotrikadze and TV Rain producer Daria Zhuk - who have both, in the last two weeks, accused deputy Leonid Slutsky of sexual impropriety. Mr Slutsky acknowledged the scandal after President Putin's state address last week, suggesting it was a political plot. \"They've made them write about this,\" he told BBC correspondents. \"People are unhappy that the authority of the foreign affairs committee, including the committee chairperson, has increased. \"This is a typical example, I'm afraid, of made-to-order journalism that, instead of diminishing our authority, has probably strengthened it.\" The State Duma - Russia's lower house - has emphasised that the Mr Slutsky's guilt has not been proven and encouraged alleged victims to file a report with the parliament's ethics committee. Ms Rustamova is currently preparing her statement to the State Duma MPs' ethics committee. She says that Leonid Slutsky has made no attempt to apologise to her over the past year. Russian law does not cover sexual harassment. Moreover, according to Oksana Pushkin, a deputy at the State Duma, the law that prohibits coercive actions of a sexual nature (article 133 of Russia's Penal Code) \"does not, in reality, work\". ",

        "content": "Saudi Arabia's crown prince is starting a three-day visit to the UK later amid protests planned against his country's role in the war in Yemen. Mohammed bin Salman, 32, is seen by some as a modernising force in the Gulf State. He is due to hold talks with Theresa May and have lunch with the Queen. The UK hopes to capitalise on the Saudi economy's opening-up but No 10 said the PM would also express \"deep concern\" at the humanitarian situation in Yemen. Demonstrators protesting against the Saudi-led coalition bombing of rebel Houthi forces in Yemen are expected outside Downing Street - where Mohammed bin Salman will meet Mrs May and other cabinet ministers. The crown prince, who is regarded as being heir presumptive to the 82-year old King Salman, is making his first visit to the UK since taking up the role last year. He will also have dinner with the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge. He is credited with kick-starting domestic reforms in the ultra-conservative desert kingdom, such as the upcoming lifting of the ban on women driving and the re-opening of commercial cinemas after 35 years, as well as tackling corruption within the government and ruling Al Saud family. A new Strategic Partnership Council will be established which it is hoped could lead to Saudi investment in and through the UK of up to \u00a3100bn during the next 10 years. 'Brutal and illegal'\nThe conflict between the Saudi-backed government in Yemen and the Houthis, backed by Iran, is seen by many as part of a regional power struggle between the two countries. According to the United Nations, more than 9,000 people, over half of them civilians, have been killed and more than 52,000 injured in fighting in Yemen since March 2015. Downing Street said Mrs May will \"acknowledge the steps\" taken recently by Saudi Arabia to address the crisis but will stress the importance of \"full and unfettered humanitarian and commercial access\" through ports which have previously been hit by coalition blockades. The PM will also call for urgent progress on securing a political resolution to the crisis, her spokesman said. Anti-war campaigners, including the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, have accused the government, a leading exporter of arms to the Saudi capital Riyadh, of being \"complicit\" in coalition bombings in Yemen.

        "content": "Seven years ago, Jamie McKechnie was the victim of an unprovoked \"one punch\" attack in south-east London. Struck in the back of a head by a total stranger, he fell face-first to the ground and suffered a serious brain injury. It left the BMX enthusiast in a coma for nine weeks. Doctors gave him a 30 percent chance of living. But supported by his family, Jamie learned to speak, walk and even cycle again. His girlfriend Ellen Murphy, who sings under the name Only Girl, was by his side throughout the recovery - and poured her emotions into music. One of the songs she wrote in that period, Mountain, has just been released - accompanied by a moving video that chronicles Jamie's journey through rehab. \"I thought it was really important for people to see what we went through,\" she says. \"To show the archive footage from his time in rehab, and especially to understand the consequences of a senseless 'one punch attack' and how this can completely alter someone's life\". End of Youtube post by onlygirlmusic Ellen was just 25 when Jamie was attacked in August 2011. The couple had just returned from a family holiday in France, and Jamie had gone for a night out with friends. \"I was at home and I got a phone call from his friend who was with him,\" she recalls. \"I had a really bad feeling, like a gut instinct that something wasn't right. \"He told me James had been attacked and he was lying unconscious on the floor. My first question was, 'Is he dead?' and his friend was like, 'I don't know.'\" Jamie was taken to the neurology unit of King's College Hospital. Ellen rushed to his side but, by the time she arrived, he was already in a coma. \"Even thinking about it now, I wonder 'How did I get through that?'\" she recalls. \"I think your mind blocks out the memory. I don't know what I was doing for those 24 hours.\" 'Brick wall'\nDoctors warned Jamie's loved ones that he might never wake up, says Ellen. \"But I never allowed myself to think of that as an eventuality.\" Instead she read to him, showed him photos, put on his favourite BMX videos and made a playlist of their 10 favourite songs, which she played on a loop. \"Anything to stimulate his senses - touch, sight, sound,\" Ellen explains. \"We'd take him outside in the wheelchair. \"It was like trying to communicate with a brick wall sometimes. You'd get no response. But I just thought there's got to be something going on, so I'm going to keep trying. \"Then, in December, he suddenly spoke.\" It was two days before Christmas 2011. Jamie's neurologists were \"extremely surprised\" he had woken up, but the family redoubled their efforts to help him recover. \"I remember everyone spending Christmas Day in the rehab facility - my dad playing guitar, singing Bob Dylan songs,\" says Ellen. \"At the time Jamie was still very uncommunicative, but you could tell in his eyes he recognised the music and he was looking around, really alert. \"Throughout his whole recovery, I found it so fascinating how music helped,\" she says, explaining how Jamie could remember song lyrics even when his speech was limited. \"I remember once he was sitting in his hospital bed and I put on the Eurythmics song Who's That Girl? - and he just suddenly started singing along,\" she says. \"And I was like, 'I've never heard him sing that song in my life!'\" Still, it was undoubtedly a traumatic time - and Ellen unburdened the emotions in her own music, each song becoming a narrative of her and Jamie's story. \"Music is a very cathartic, therapeutic way of processing your emotions without going crazy,\" she says. Ellen - who as Only Girl has worked with Zero 7 and won support from BBC Music Introducing - released Mountain last week. A soulful, reflective hymn to hope and love, it sees Murphy singing: \"Even though words we could not speak, into your heart still I could reach / I always knew you would come back to me.\" In the video, she and Jamie stand, holding hands, in front of a video screen onto which are projected home videos of their life together. \"It was incredibly surreal,\" she says of making the video. \"It's like watching it happen to somebody else. \"This [life] has become normal for us - but when you see it all put together chronologically like that, you're like, 'Oh my God - we went through this together.' \"You forget that, at one point, Jamie couldn't lift his hand up, he couldn't walk up the stairs, he couldn't brush his teeth - and now he's back on his bike, working in the bike shop, going to the pub, getting drunk. \"It's pretty remarkable and I forget that sometimes.\" The video's most striking moment comes when we see Jamie walking unaided for the first time - as he headed down the aisle to marry Ellen in 2014. \"It was a big milestone for him,\" she says, \"and obviously it made it all the more emotional. \"Everyone was crying and cheering for us. It was a really big moment.\" Jamie will never fully recover from his injuries - for which his attacker received a three-year jail sentence. (He was released after one year.) In Bittersweet, another song from Ellen's forthcoming EP, the singer describes \"the bittersweet feeling of having Jamie back and him recovering, but also the loss of the person he was before. But she hopes that, by sharing her and Jamie's experiences, she can give strength to people in similar situations. \"It shows you should never give up in any situation, no matter how dire it seems.\" She's given Mountain to brain injury charity Headway, which continues to support Jamie, and is seeing a huge response when she plays the songs live. \"We did an acoustic show last week and I felt like I was going to cry the whole time,\" she says. \"And when I came off stage, a guy just came up to me and gave me a big hug.\" Only Girl will represent the UK at the South By South West festival in Austin, Texas later this month. Her EP, Young Blood, will be launched with a special show at Thousand Island in London on 3 May. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

        "content": "Maxine Turner left school without a single qualification. \"But I knew I wasn't thick,\" she says. She went on to get a teaching qualification and now she's running education courses trying to help adults without qualifications, without jobs and often drained of self-confidence. Maxine is speaking at Mowbray Gardens Library in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, where a group is gathering for lessons taught by the Workers Educational Association (WEA), the largest voluntary sector provider of adult education. There are ex-miners here who haven't worked since the pits closed in the 1980s. When Maxine left school in the 1970s, she says working class youngsters were expected to go straight into factories, mines or the steelworks. They didn't need to take exams. \"Maths may as well have been taught in Martian language,\" she says. 'A kind of malaise'\nBut those industries have declined and communities have been left behind. \"There's a kind of malaise that falls over like a blanket. It's really hard to break through,\" says Maxine, who found her own way back into learning through the WEA, where she became a tutor. There have been endless policy announcements and glossy strategies about improving vocational skills and helping people to retrain. But how does that really translate at the sharp end? It's tough enough for people with qualifications - imagine what it's like without any exams and your only work experience is in jobs that no longer exist. \"We all need respect. Everyone should have a chance,\" says Shane, who is part of the student group. He doesn't want anyone looking down their noses at people trying to find work or training for a fresh start. Students talk of feeling \"belittled\" by an often faceless online application process. These are the disenfranchised white, working class. Not working, but at least back in class. 'Communities aren't there any more'\nAt the weekly lesson, they're being taught IT skills that could help them write an application letter, put together a CV or find ways to access information online. It's also about working as a group. There are repeated comments about the threat of social isolation in areas where there are shrinking numbers of shared places to be together. \"People lived, drank, worked together. But those communities aren't there any more,\" says Maxine. Richard, in his 40s, says he'd been living more or less like a \"recluse\", sometimes struggling with depression and finding it difficult to get out of the house. This WEA class had given him a sense of purpose and friendship, as well as learning. The need for retraining is profound. North-south divide\nIn Rotherham, 12% of the working-age population have no qualifications - in Surrey it's 4%, in parts of London it's too low to be measured. It's a problem that is markedly worse across the north of England compared with the south. London represents the other end of the spectrum, with the highest concentration of graduates anywhere in Europe. For those who find work in Rotherham, the typical full-time annual salary in the town is about \u00a325,600. The news agenda has been focused on value for money for university students, but it's those without qualifications who are almost twice as likely not to be working. The WEA runs 8,000 adult courses per year - with a very different social profile from the debate about university access. Among their students, almost half have no or almost no qualifications, almost 40% live in the most deprived areas, a quarter have health problems and 12% have mental health difficulties. But it's also where education can make the biggest difference. Research into the impact of WEA courses has shown big improvements in employability and positive benefits for those with mental health conditions. Parents reported being more confident with helping their own children to learn. However, it's an uphill struggle. Inside the library there are three separate adult education courses taking place, but the back windows seem to be pitted with what look like air-rifle impacts. Whether or not that's the cause, it seems an appropriate metaphor for people trying to improve but being assailed from every side. Parents learning together\nIn York, another WEA group is gathering. This might be an historic, picturesque city, but it's a tourist economy with lots of insecure, low-paid work. Its schools have the lowest level of per pupil funding in England. The group here are taking part in a project where parents learn about helping in school and are encouraged to improve their own skills. \"When you've got a child, but you don't have the financial backing, it's very difficult to get training,\" says Annemarie. \"I struggled at school with the academic stuff, my self-esteem was very low. I felt stupid. That's what I told myself. I stopped trying because it felt so hard to try.\" But she says her confidence has been reinvigorated by her return to lessons. You may also like:\n\"I was that scared. I was shy, this awkward person. I felt like a proper lost cause,\" says Laura, also on the Helping In Schools course. \"I left school when I was 14, I didn't gain any GCSEs. I thought this is me, this is all I have to offer. \"But with this course, I've proved I can still do something. \"Now I feel like I can go on to other things.\" Applying for jobs left her filled with a sense of \"not being good enough\". \"You think you're going to be turned down straight away.\" She spent a long time in her flat, not going out. There are many people like her, she says, \"going under the radar\". Now she wants to work with children and is going to study how to help with special educational needs. The students and their tutors say the barriers to learning are often practical. Courses can cost too much or the lack of transport can make them out of reach. Affordable childcare can be the key to returning to learning. Again and again these students mention the need for confidence and to make learning seem less daunting. Another student, Catherine, says it used to be much easier to get jobs without qualifications, but now they need to have exams. \"People can do it if they get help,\" says Laura. \"They throw the tablets at you, but this has helped me more than any medication. \"I feel like my life's been turned around. I want to keep on learning now.\" ",

        "content": "Incredibly expensive to run, and under increasing pressure to keep up with the big boys like Alton Towers and Drayton Manor, many modest amusement parks have struggled with dwindling visitor numbers before coming to a complete standstill. One of the most recent victims is Pleasure Island in Cleethorpes, which closed at the end of the 2016 season after 23 years of business. Those keen to get their hands on a piece of its history, as well as bag a bargain, can buy some of the fixtures and fittings as the contents are sold at auction. Lots include \"a large box of comedy glasses\" expected to go for about \u00a310, various pieces of catering equipment, and for the pleasure-seeker with \u00a3250,000 to burn, the 114-year-old carousel. But after the last candy floss has been eaten and the gates closed for the final time, what happens at the parks where the top thrill was a twirl on the teacups, a spin on the dodgems or a pit-stop at the petting zoo? Some sites are sold and developed, others remain in the custody of a security guard or two and left to rot, while a handful become spookily picturesque. Take a look around some of England's abandoned theme parks. ",

        "content": "Charli Howard isn't short of an opinion or six. \"Models are models for a reason,\" the 26-year-old tells BBC News. \"Not everyone photographs in the same way.\" It's a refreshingly blunt assessment of the workings of the fashion world, and perhaps an unusual one for a member of the inclusion-championing body positivity movement. \"You don't want to see your mate Janet in Vogue, you want to see people you can aspire to. I think we want to look for people whose lives seem a bit more glamorous than our own.\" While Charli thinks models shouldn't look too ordinary (sorry Janet), the key thing is that aspirational beauty \"shouldn't be associated with just one body type\". \"I look at models like Ashley Graham, who are like size 16, and I still want to be Ashley Graham, 'cause she's cool as hell,\" she says. \"I don't think women are necessarily drawn to body shapes, I think it's about the personalities of women in magazines and what they stand for.\" Charli has just published her first book, Misfit - a memoir that deals openly with her problems with eating disorders and mental health. She says she struggled to fit in during her school years, which led to her suffering from anxiety and ultimately being attracted to modelling as a way to escape her surroundings. \"I didn't know what I wanted to do as a career, and then I kept getting scouted and people said, 'You should try modelling',\" she explains. \"Now, for someone who lived in the middle of Wales at boarding school who felt completely alone, modelling was like this glamorous way out. \"So the book is about someone who was a bit unstable in the brain, how I chased this idea that if I finally got to my dream weight or got accepted by the modelling elite that I would finally be happy.\" Today\u2019s #OOTD consists of my fave @alexachungstagram shirt & dress with @stuartweitzman boots \ud83e\udd33\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude18 A post shared by Charli Howard (@charlihoward) on Feb 19, 2018 at 9:26am PST End of Instagram post by charlihoward Charli lays bare the multiple casting calls she went to, where she was regularly told she was too big for a certain client or campaign - despite having drastically altered her diet. One rejection prompted her to write a Facebook post, which rapidly went viral, calling out the industry for its demands. \"I refuse to feel ashamed and upset on a daily basis for not meeting your ridiculous, unattainable beauty standards,\" she wrote. Ironically, the attention from the post led to interest from a modelling agency in the US. Charli looked into their background and found they had a \"curve division\". Within a few days, she had flown out to meet them and signed up. She now lives in the US full-time, working as a model - albeit one who is classed as plus-size. \"I have a D-cup. I have hips. I'm never going to fit the super-skinny category any more,\" she says. \"If we're going by industry standards, I'm only going to fit the curved market. \"There isn't really a section for me. There's no-one really representing the UK size 10-12, you either have to be really skinny or really big. \"And I am one of a handful of people trying to show that you can model at this natural size. And it's slap bang in the middle of both categories. And you can still do fashion. That's my whole point.\" Fake happiness vs. Real happiness \ud83e\udd17 No life vs. Best life ever \ud83d\udca5 No pizza vs. Pizza every now and again \ud83c\udf55 Straight-sized model vs. Plus-size model \ud83c\udf89 Which life would you rather have? #recovery A post shared by Charli Howard (@charlihoward) on Oct 25, 2017 at 1:25pm PDT End of Instagram post 2 by charlihoward Charli may be a healthy weight now, but has struggled with anorexia and bulimia throughout her life - conditions she acknowledges are difficult for many to comprehend. In 2016, Dame Joan Bakewell attracted criticism when she suggested anorexia was a disease of the western world. \"No-one has anorexia in societies where there is not enough food,\" she told the Sunday Times. \"They do not have anorexia in the camps in Syria. I think it's possible anorexia could be about narcissism.\" Bakewell later apologised but several columnists agreed with her - including Angela Epstein in The Telegraph and Rod Liddle in The Spectator, who said it was a \"primarily middle-class illness\". I raise this point cautiously with Charli, but she's quite understanding of this view. \"One of the earliest cases of anorexia was one of Henry VIII's wives. Really upper class,\" she says - referring to Catherine of Aragon. \"Poor people wouldn't have had that because they didn't have access to food, they wouldn't starve themselves. \"So I do kind of question if having access to food is maybe a factor. I had access to food and therefore also had the ability to restrict it. \"It's the class system, if you have money, you can afford to restrict, if you don't then you can't... I know that's quite a controversial thing.\" But, she adds, her main reason for minimising her diet was down to \"a society that really put pressure on me to lose weight\".

Including, she says, other plus-size models. \"Plus-size in an industry term, that's not something I've given myself. And I've had very successful plus-size models say to me 'Well you're not plus-size, I find that really offensive.' \"But what I'm looking for is the unification of women, and to see women on one board, where they don't have to be put into categories based on their sizes.\" She admits: \"I'm very young to be a plus-size model, most of them are in their 30s. And the 'straight-size' models, their work kind of dies out around 25, 30 if they're lucky. So I do feel quite lucky in that respect.\" Charli says there's \"tonnes\" of work out there for models larger than the average size, \"especially in America, not so much in the UK\". She adds: \"This is what I don't understand. I think the UK still has these qualms or these weird association with the term 'plus-size'.\" Unretouched and very happy for @Desigual \ud83d\udc95\ud83e\udd17 #iamallwoman #desigual A post shared by Charli Howard (@charlihoward) on Mar 16, 2017 at 10:17am PDT End of Instagram post 4 by charlihoward The rise of social media since Charli's school days, and Instagram in particular, has, if anything, reinforced beauty stereotypes, making the voice of more diverse figures more powerful. \"Fitspo accounts, thinspo accounts [short for fitspiration and thinspiration], you see models who are super-toned - I think that sends a completely different message as well, so it must be really tough,\" she says. \"I don't think I could be a teenager now. I think I would literally have a breakdown if I was a teenager now. \"But I think that's exactly why we need the Body Positive movement.\" Misfit by Charli Howard is out now.

Stormy Daniels says the agreement, drawn up before the 2016 election, is \"void\" because he did not sign it. Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, confirmed last month he had privately paid her $130,000 (\u00a395,000). The lawsuit alleges that Mr Cohen tried to \"intimidate her into silence.\" In a 2011 interview with InTouch magazine, the actress said she began a sexual relationship with Mr Trump in 2006, shortly after his wife Melania had given birth to his son Barron. The reports re-emerged in January when the Wall Street Journal reported that she was paid to sign a non-disclosure agreement in the run up to the 2016 election, which prevented her from discussing the alleged liaison. Mr Cohen has said the president \"vehemently denies\" any romantic involvement with the adult film star, The civil lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles on Tuesday, says that only days before the election, Ms Clifford and Mr Cohen signed the \"hush agreement\" but Mr Trump did not, \"thus rendering it legally null and void and of no consequence\". It adds: \"To be clear, the attempts to intimidate Ms Clifford into silence and 'shut her up' in order to 'protect Mr Trump' continue unabated.\" Although Mr Cohen confirmed that he paid the money to Ms Clifford, he did not say what it was for. He said last month that neither Mr Trump nor the Trump Organization was a party to the transaction. \"The payment to Ms Clifford was lawful, and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone,\" he said.

Adam Purinton, 52, shot Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani at Austin's Bar and Grill in Olathe in February 2017. Witnesses said Purinton opened fire with a handgun after shouting: \"Get out of my country!\" Mr Kuchibhotla died and Mr Madasani was injured. Bystander Ian Grillot was shot and injured as he tried to intervene. Mr Kuchibhotla and Mr Madasani, both Indian nationals, were working as engineers at tech firm Garmin. After the attack, the gunman drove away before stopping at a restaurant in Missouri to tell a staff member he had just shot two Iranians. Purinton, who is white, waived his right to a jury trial in state court on Tuesday. He admitted one count of premeditated first-degree murder in Mr Kuchibhotla's death. Appearing in Johnson County District Court, he also pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted premeditated first-degree murder in the shootings of Mr Madasani and Mr Grillot. His sentencing is scheduled for 4 May. Purinton still faces a federal case over the attack - including hate crime charges - that could carry a possible death sentence. Mr Kuchibhotla's widow, who was not in court, said after Tuesday's plea agreement that the outcome showed hate was never acceptable. \"We must understand and love one another,\" Sunayana Dumala said in her statement to the Kansas City Star. \"Let us continue to work for peace, understanding and love - the things Srinu stood for and will be his legacy.\" According to the newspaper, Purinton will spend the rest of his life in prison under his plea agreement.

        "content": "The pine marten has emerged as an unlikely ally for the beleaguered native red squirrel in its battle with the grey squirrel. This is according to scientists at the University of Aberdeen, who carried out an in-depth forensic study of the relationship between the three species. The pine marten is a predator of the reds, but in areas where it thrives, the number of grey squirrels reduces. The findings are published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B. The journal study suggests that the pine martens reverse the \"typical relationship\" between red and grey squirrels, where the red always loses out, according to lead researcher Dr Emma Sheehy. \"Where pine marten activity is high, grey squirrel populations are actually heavily suppressed. And that gives the competitive advantage to red squirrels,\" she said. \"So you see lots of red squirrels and you see them coming back into areas where they hadn't been for quite some time.\" Woodland forensics\nTo work this out, the team carried out what Dr Sheehy described as \"forest CSI\". She and her colleagues attached sticky pads to the undersides of baited feeder boxes. \"All three species use these boxes and when an animal lifts the lid with its head, it leaves us a little hair sample for our analysis,\" Dr Sheehy said. With DNA from those hair samples and images from motion-activated cameras confirming which animals were visiting the feeders, the scientists were able to assess each species' population and activity levels. Pine martens - cat-sized members of the weasel family - are gradually becoming re-established in parts of Scotland, after their near extinction in the UK. They used to be trapped in large numbers by game-keepers, and also hunted for their fur, which was a valuable export from Scotland. It is has been illegal to hunt the animals since the 1980s, and their numbers are now increasing. In recent years, evidence has emerged that they are also crossing the border and becoming established in Northumberland. A small population of the mammals was also relocated in 2015 from Scotland to Wales. This evidence - that their comeback has given a boost to red squirrel survival - could indicate that they are able to catch and eat the non-native greys more easily. \"Red squirrels co-evolved with pine martens,\" explained Dr Sheehy. \"They've managed to co-exist over such a long time and their population doesn't seem to be affected by losing the odd individual to a predator.\" Grey squirrels on the other hand were introduced from the eastern coast of North America, where there are no pine martens. \"They aren't used to living with a predator so adept at climbing trees, and they spend a lot more time on the ground. So, theoretically, they are much more susceptible,\" Dr Sheehy told BBC News. \"We have the case of the recovery of one very rare protected species actually helping the recovery of another species, for which we didn't know what the future held. \"So it's kind of a two-in-one good news conservation story.\" Follow Victoria on Twitter ",

        "content": "The government's emergency committee Cobra is to be updated on the police probe into the suspected poisoning of a former Russian double agent. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, have spent a third night in a critical condition in hospital after being found unconscious in Salisbury. Scientists at the UK's military research facility at Porton Down are examining an \"unknown substance\". Met Police counter terrorism officers have extended cordons in the city. A bridge was shut on Tuesday evening, while Salisbury's Zizzi restaurant and The Bishop's Mill pub remain sealed off. Mr Skripal and his daughter were found slumped and unconscious on a bench outside the Maltings shopping centre on Sunday afternoon. The Cobra meeting will be chaired by Home Secretary Amber Rudd. The cross-departmental committee meets to examine government responses to national emergencies. Scotland Yard, which took over the investigation from Wiltshire Police on Tuesday, said it was keeping an \"open mind\" and the case had not been declared a terrorist incident. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said: \"This investigation is at the early stages and any speculation is unhelpful... \"We would like to reassure members of the public that this incident is being taken extremely seriously and we currently do not believe there is any immediate risk to the wider public.\" BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban said scientists at Porton Down have still not identified the substance the pair are thought to have been exposed to, with one official saying they were being treated for \"symptoms rather than causes\". Prof Alastair Hay, from the University of Leeds, said test results could take several days. He said: \"Individuals cannot provide unlimited amounts of blood for testing so investigations will be guided by the clinical team.\" Two police officers caught up in the suspected contamination were treated in hospital for minor symptoms, before they were given the all clear. It is understood their symptoms included itchy eyes and wheezing. A third member of the emergency services remains in hospital. Relatives of Col Skripal, who was convicted in Russia in 2006 of spying for Britain, have told the BBC Russian Service that he believed the country's special services might come after him at any time. His wife, elder brother and his son have died in the past two years, some in mysterious circumstances, the family believes. Ms Skripal lives in Moscow and has visited her father in the UK regularly, especially during the past two years. On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the case. He said that could include sanctions and asking UK dignitaries not to attend the World Cup in Russia this summer. The foreign secretary said he was not pointing fingers, but described Russia as \"a malign and disruptive force\". Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning The possibility of an unexplained substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko - a public inquiry concluded the killing of the Russian dissident had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, and says it is open to co-operating with British police if requested. In a statement, the Russian embassy in London said: \"Media reports create an impression of a planned operation by the Russian special services, which is completely untrue.\" Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI as part of a swap. He was later flown to the UK. According to BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban, in recent years Col Skripal gave lectures at military academies offering insight into Russia's foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU.

        "content": "The papers and news websites continue to pore over the details of the suspected poisoning in Salisbury of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. According to the Times, Whitehall sources say the police and MI5 are treating it as a suspected assassination attempt linked to Russia although they have not ruled out alternative theories, such as a rival faction wanting to frame Russia and undermine President Putin's regime. An analysis in the Guardian suggests Mr Skripal may have been punished for having a continuing relationship with British intelligence, or the suspicion of one. The Sun turns to the hunt for whoever did it with a huge headline: \"Find lady with a red handbag\". It claims a blonde woman apparently seen in CCTV footage walking with an older man near the bench where the stricken pair were discovered was initially thought to be Yulia, but is is, in fact, a suspect. Several papers carry reports that Mr Skripal feared for his life after the mysterious deaths of his wife and son. The Daily Mail says that, although his wife's 2012 death certificate gave the cause as cancer, neighbours say she was killed in a car crash. The Financial Times says any evidence implicating Moscow in the poisoning would send UK-Russian relations, which are at a post-war low, into the deep freeze. A former associate of the murdered ex-KGB agent Alexander Livinenko is quoted by Huffpost saying \"this has all the hallmarks of a Putin assassination\". Yuri Felshtinsky believes the Russian president is warning other agents never to defect, while Ed West in the Spectator asks: \"Will Britain stand up to Russia?\" Russian newspapers are also taking an interest. Komosomolskaya Pravda is dismissive of the whole affair, finding it \"amazing\" that the \"odious\" Boris Johnson actively supports new sanctions while admitting that \"it is too early to draw conclusions\". Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning The Daily Mirror highlights the case of a child who it says was forced to wait more than more than six days for a hospital bed. It says the case, in Derby, is included in figures for the last 12 months showing A&E delays at their worst levels in NHS history. Derby Teaching Hospital tells the paper the child, who was awaiting mental health treatment, was not on a trolley, but being cared for in a paediatric assessment unit. Moderating force\nSeveral papers report a major new study suggesting that screening men for prostate cancer may do more harm than good. The Daily Telegraph says the largest ever trial funded by Cancer Research UK found that the screening made no difference to death rates and often detected tumours that were harmless while missing others that were fatal. \"Symptomless men,\" says the Sun, \"often underwent surgery for slow-growing tumours that were harmless\". According to the Times, any screening is better than no screening but better screening is needed. Across the Atlantic, the big news is the resignation of Donald Trump's top economic adviser, Gary Cohn The New York Times says it leaves the president surrounded by people with strong protectionist views. According to the Washington Post, Mr Cohn was a financial heavyweight who was regarded by business executives and foreign leaders as a moderating force. Hedonistic baby boomers\nFinally, the Daily Mail reports that medical experts have urged GPs to question the over-50s about their drinking and drug taking habits. A report by the Royal College of Pyschiatrists says \"hedonistic\" baby boomers have very liberal attitudes after growing up in the 1960s and 1970s. Some are also self-medicating to combat loneliness, insomnia or chronic pain and the paper says GPs are being advised to look out for signs, such as slurred speech or abnormal liver test results. ",

        "content": "Maxine Turner left school without a single qualification. \"But I knew I wasn't thick,\" she says. She went on to get a teaching qualification and now she's running education courses trying to help adults without qualifications, without jobs and often drained of self-confidence. Maxine is speaking at Mowbray Gardens Library in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, where a group is gathering for lessons taught by the Workers Educational Association (WEA), the largest voluntary sector provider of adult education. There are ex-miners here who haven't worked since the pits closed in the 1980s. When Maxine left school in the 1970s, she says working class youngsters were expected to go straight into factories, mines or the steelworks. They didn't need to take exams. \"Maths may as well have been taught in Martian language,\" she says. 'A kind of malaise'\nBut those industries have declined and communities have been left behind. \"There's a kind of malaise that falls over like a blanket. It's really hard to break through,\" says Maxine, who found her own way back into learning through the WEA, where she became a tutor. There have been endless policy announcements and glossy strategies about improving vocational skills and helping people to retrain. But how does that really translate at the sharp end? It's tough enough for people with qualifications - imagine what it's like without any exams and your only work experience is in jobs that no longer exist. \"We all need respect. Everyone should have a chance,\" says Shane, who is part of the student group. He doesn't want anyone looking down their noses at people trying to find work or training for a fresh start. Students talk of feeling \"belittled\" by an often faceless online application process. These are the disenfranchised white, working class. Not working, but at least back in class. 'Communities aren't there any more'\nAt the weekly lesson, they're being taught IT skills that could help them write an application letter, put together a CV or find ways to access information online. It's also about working as a group. There are repeated comments about the threat of social isolation in areas where there are shrinking numbers of shared places to be together. \"People lived, drank, worked together. But those communities aren't there any more,\" says Maxine. Richard, in his 40s, says he'd been living more or less like a \"recluse\", sometimes struggling with depression and finding it difficult to get out of the house. This WEA class had given him a sense of purpose and friendship, as well as learning. The need for retraining is profound. North-south divide\nIn Rotherham, 12% of the working-age population have no qualifications - in Surrey it's 4%, in parts of London it's too low to be measured. It's a problem that is markedly worse across the north of England compared with the south. London represents the other end of the spectrum, with the highest concentration of graduates anywhere in Europe. For those who find work in Rotherham, the typical full-time annual salary in the town is about \u00a325,600. The news agenda has been focused on value for money for university students, but it's those without qualifications who are almost twice as likely not to be working. The WEA runs 8,000 adult courses per year - with a very different social profile from the debate about university access. Among their students, almost half have no or almost no qualifications, almost 40% live in the most deprived areas, a quarter have health problems and 12% have mental health difficulties. But it's also where education can make the biggest difference. Research into the impact of WEA courses has shown big improvements in employability and positive benefits for those with mental health conditions. Parents reported being more confident with helping their own children to learn. However, it's an uphill struggle. Inside the library there are three separate adult education courses taking place, but the back windows seem to be pitted with what look like air-rifle impacts. Whether or not that's the cause, it seems an appropriate metaphor for people trying to improve but being assailed from every side. Parents learning together\nIn York, another WEA group is gathering. This might be an historic, picturesque city, but it's a tourist economy with lots of insecure, low-paid work. Its schools have the lowest level of per pupil funding in England. The group here are taking part in a project where parents learn about helping in school and are encouraged to improve their own skills. \"When you've got a child, but you don't have the financial backing, it's very difficult to get training,\" says Annemarie. \"I struggled at school with the academic stuff, my self-esteem was very low. I felt stupid. That's what I told myself. I stopped trying because it felt so hard to try.\" But she says her confidence has been reinvigorated by her return to lessons. You may also like:\n\"I was that scared. I was shy, this awkward person. I felt like a proper lost cause,\" says Laura, also on the Helping In Schools course. \"I left school when I was 14, I didn't gain any GCSEs. I thought this is me, this is all I have to offer. \"But with this course, I've proved I can still do something. \"Now I feel like I can go on to other things.\" Applying for jobs left her filled with a sense of \"not being good enough\". \"You think you're going to be turned down straight away.\" She spent a long time in her flat, not going out. There are many people like her, she says, \"going under the radar\". Now she wants to work with children and is going to study how to help with special educational needs. The students and their tutors say the barriers to learning are often practical. Courses can cost too much or the lack of transport can make them out of reach. Affordable childcare can be the key to returning to learning. Again and again these students mention the need for confidence and to make learning seem less daunting. Another student, Catherine, says it used to be much easier to get jobs without qualifications, but now they need to have exams. \"People can do it if they get help,\" says Laura. \"They throw the tablets at you, but this has helped me more than any medication. \"I feel like my life's been turned around. I want to keep on learning now.\" ",

Here's your morning briefing: Ex-spy's illness: Cobra to be briefed\nFormer Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia are still critically ill after a suspected poisoning in the UK. Amid speculation as to who, if anyone, was responsible, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has called Russia's government a \"malign and disruptive force\". The UK government's emergency committee, Cobra, will be briefed on the incident later. Moscow has denied any involvement. Police are still looking at whether Mr and Ms Skripal were poisoned before being discovered unconscious on a bench outside a shopping centre in Salisbury, Wiltshire. What signs will they be searching for? Here's a look at Salisbury, described by one resident as being \"just so quintessentially English\". Trump's top economic adviser quits\nWas he angry about Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports? The US president's top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, has resigned. A supporter of free trade - and a key mover behind Mr Trump's tax reforms - he said it had been an \"honour\" to serve. His departure could mark a \"sharp new direction in White House policy\" towards protectionism, writes BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher. Mr Cohn joins a list of senior officials who have been fired or who have quit since Mr Trump took office. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning Protests expected as Saudi crown prince visits UK\nDuring his three-day visit he will have lunch with the Queen and hold talks with Theresa May, but Mohammed bin Salman's time in the UK is likely to be beset by protests against his country's role in the war in Yemen. The 32-year-old crown prince of Saudi Arabia is credited with kick-starting domestic reforms in the ultra-conservative kingdom, such as the upcoming lifting of the ban on women driving and the re-opening of commercial cinemas. But demonstrations against the Saudi-led coalition's bombing of rebel Houthi forces in Yemen are expected outside Downing Street. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale looks at why the crown prince's visit matters. The girl who sabotaged her own wedding\nBy Naomi Grimley, global affairs correspondent As Monika sits alongside her parents and recounts her story, she seems to bear them no ill will. But last year, as her wedding drew nearer, it must have been a time of immense tension. She does not appear to be a natural teenage rebel and her shy mannerisms suggest a girl who is still finding her own voice in the world. Yet somewhere within she found the strength to kick back against the plans her family had made.

The Times quotes Whitehall sources as saying police and MI5 are treating the incident as an assassination attempt.

Both openers fell for ducks, with Colin Munro wasting New Zealand's only review as he was trapped lbw by Mark Wood's first delivery. Alongside Williamson, Taylor steadied the innings. The New Zealand captain played carefully while Taylor was more aggressive, hitting Wood for consecutive leg side boundaries, before Williamson edged a tame long hop from Ben Stokes through to wicketkeeper Jos Buttler. Taylor continued to accumulate, working his way to a half-century with little fuss, and was helped by Latham, who was handed a reprieve on four when Moeen Ali dropped a simple caught and bowled chance. Steady scoring helped Taylor reach his 18th ODI century but a reoccurrence of his thigh injury hindered his movement. Unable to run, Taylor freed his arms. He struck 14 runs from seven deliveries, hitting Stokes for six before thrashing Wood to the cover boundary - he finished with six sixes and 17 fours in his 147-ball knock. When Latham fell, miscuing Curran to backward point, de Grandhomme picked up the mantle. His first four balls were smashed for 15 runs to leave the Black Caps needing a run a ball from the final six overs. It was not that simple. De Grandhomme picked out Woakes at backward point and Curran and Woakes used all their variations to keep England in the game. However, Nicholls stood tall to hit his first boundary of the innings and force a deciding match. More to follow. ",

Taylor continued to accumulate, working his way to a half-century with little fuss, and was helped by Latham, who was handed a reprieve on four when Moeen Ali dropped a simple caught and bowled chance. Steady scoring helped Taylor reach his 19th ODI century but a reoccurrence of his thigh injury hindered his movement. Unable to run, Taylor freed his arms. He struck 14 runs from seven deliveries, hitting Stokes for six before thrashing Wood to the cover boundary - he finished with six sixes and 17 fours in his 147-ball knock. When Latham fell, miscuing Curran to backward point, de Grandhomme picked up the mantle. His first four balls were smashed for 15 runs to leave the Black Caps needing a run a ball from the final six overs. It was not that simple. De Grandhomme picked out Woakes at backward point and Curran and Woakes used all their variations to keep England in the game. However, Nicholls stood tall to hit his first boundary of the innings and force a deciding match. Bairstow has struggled to establish himself in England's one-day squad - in 41 matches since making his debut in 2011, he has batted in every position from one to six - but he has been preferred at the top of the order over the past year. He took a back seat to Jason Roy at the start of the innings but once Roy fell, hitting leg-spinner Ish Sodhi to Mitchell Santner at short leg for 42, Bairstow accelerated. Two towering straight sixes and a late cut were the highlight as he and Root took advantage of an off-colour bowling attack. Bairstow offered a chance on 74 as he chased a Sodhi delivery but Santner, fielding at cover, couldn't hold on to a regulation catch. It barely slowed him down as he struck 14 boundaries and seven sixes on his way to his fastest one-day century, taking his average while batting at two to 53.50. Root played a quieter role in the 190-run stand with Bairstow but was no less effective, using sweep shots and quick singles to reach his first ODI century in 17 innings. He may have reached three figures quicker had he not struggled for the strike. Once Bairstow fell, caught in the deep trying to hit Munro for another six, England faltered, losing eight wickets for 46 runs. Their big hitters fell quickly, giving themselves no time to settle in. Eoin Morgan and Ben Stokes were caught attempting big shots, Buttler was caught and bowled by Sodhi and the slow bowler's flight deceived Moeen as he returned figures of 4-58. England, having been in a strong position, had scored 50 runs in 11 overs and looked in danger of being bowled out before Curran hit 18 runs from the final six balls. It felt as though England were light on runs - and Taylor proved it in some style. Ex-England spinner Graeme Swann on BBC Test Match Special: \"You've got to take your hat off to Ross Taylor. He was superb. But England lost this game. They have to look at themselves and say, 'how on earth have we chucked that position away?'\" Former New Zealand captain Jeremy Coney: \"Taylor is a tough rooster, he really is. You don't sneak a sunrise past him.\" Ex-England batsman James Taylor: \"It looked like complacency - almost arrogance - from England, to go hell for leather straight up in your innings. They had a brain fade in the middle overs and that massively cost them in this game.\" New Zealand captain Kane Williamson on Sky Sports: \"Ross played his best one-day knock - one of the best one-day knocks we've seen. Ross' knock was just sensational. He has been batting like this all year. \"We needed him to be out there. He had a few niggles. It was an outstanding partnership with him and Tom Latham.\" ",

        "content": "Saudi Arabia's crown prince is starting a three-day visit to the UK later amid protests planned against his country's role in the war in Yemen. Mohammed bin Salman, 32, is seen by some as a modernising force in the Gulf State. He is due to hold talks with Theresa May and have lunch with the Queen. The UK hopes to capitalise on the Saudi economy's opening-up but No 10 said the PM would also express \"deep concern\" at the humanitarian situation in Yemen. Demonstrators protesting against the Saudi-led coalition bombing of rebel Houthi forces in Yemen are expected outside Downing Street - where Mohammed bin Salman will meet Mrs May and other cabinet ministers. The crown prince, who is regarded as being heir presumptive to the 82-year old King Salman, is making his first visit to the UK since taking up the role last year. He will also have dinner with the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge. He is credited with kick-starting domestic reforms in the ultra-conservative desert kingdom, such as the upcoming lifting of the ban on women driving and the re-opening of commercial cinemas after 35 years, as well as tackling corruption within the government and ruling Al Saud family. A new Strategic Partnership Council will be established which it is hoped could lead to Saudi investment in and through the UK of up to \u00a3100bn during the next 10 years. 'Saudis high on wish list'\nBy BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale When this relative novice on the world stage arrives in London on his first global tour since taking office, he will be granted the reddest of red carpets. The Crown Prince is looking for international support for his internal economic reforms while at the same time trying to offer reassurance to nervous international investors. And the British government is keen to transform a security and defence relationship into one that includes broader economic ties as well. The UK also has an unashamed appetite for inward investment from Saudi Arabia. In other words, post-Brexit Britain will need allies, markets and money - and the Saudis are high on the UK's wish list. Read more from James The conflict between the Saudi-backed government in Yemen and the Houthis, backed by Iran, is seen by many as part of a regional power struggle between the two countries. According to the United Nations, more than 9,000 people, over half of them civilians, have been killed and more than 52,000 injured in fighting in Yemen since March 2015. Downing Street said Mrs May will \"acknowledge the steps\" taken recently by Saudi Arabia to address the crisis but will stress the importance of \"full and unfettered humanitarian and commercial access\" through ports which have previously been hit by coalition blockades. The PM will also call for urgent progress on securing a political resolution to the crisis, her spokesman said. Anti-war campaigners, including the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, have accused the government, a leading exporter of arms to the Saudi capital Riyadh, of being \"complicit\" in coalition bombings in Yemen.

        "content": "Media playback is not supported on this device Sir Bradley Wiggins and former Team Sky doctor Richard Freeman need to \"come forward and tell the truth\", says the team's ex-coach Shane Sutton. An MPs' report says Team Sky \"crossed an ethical line\" by using drugs allowed under anti-doping rules to enhance performance instead of just for medical purposes. Wiggins was named but told the BBC he is \"100%\" not a cheat. \"They need to explain it all to everybody,\" Sutton told Sky Sports. The report by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee said Team Sky used the anti-inflammatory drug triamcinolone to prepare Britain's most decorated Olympian Wiggins and a smaller group of riders for the Tour de France, which he won in 2012. Asthmatic Wiggins was granted therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) to take the corticosteroid triamcinolone, which can treat allergies and respiratory issues, shortly before the 2011 Tour de France, his 2012 Tour win and the 2013 Giro d'Italia. But the report says he used it as many as nine times in four years, which Wiggins described as \"completely malicious\". He added he took it just once out of competition - which is legal - \"after the 2013 Giro d'Italia, when I came out with a knee problem\". \"I cannot say I know a lot about Brad's use of it in or out of competition,\" said Sutton, who was also a former technical director for British Cycling. \"I am told by the doctor he needs a TUE for this event etcetera etcetera. Outside of the event, you have to sit down and ask them. \"I call for the doctor and Brad to come forward and answer these questions, they are not for me. \"I am calling for him and the doctor to come forward and tell the truth. \"He is a sufferer, I have seen him suffer and gasping for breath after effort, I saw what he was going though, I cannot answer how often he used it. Only the doctor and him can tell us. \"They need to explain it all to everybody and everyone knows the word cheat needs to be taken out of the equation. The report says he did not cheat, so come forward and tell everyone what you administered, when, and let us put it to bed.\" Sutton, who gave evidence to the committee last year, was also asked about a treatment administered to Wiggins on the team bus after winning the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine. Freeman and Wiggins say the cyclist was treated some hours later at a training camp - a point Freeman reiterated to Sky Sports following Sutton's interview. However, Sutton said: \"I understand he was treated on the bus, I thought it was public knowledge. This goes back to 12 months ago, when I was interviewed, that is the statement I made, that is what the doctor told me.\" Sutton did, though, question the evidence of an anonymous \"well-placed\" source who told the committee that Team Sky used triamcinolone to prepare Wiggins and a smaller group of riders for the 2012 Tour. \"I totally refute that,\" Sutton said. \"What you have to remember is that Brad and I worked in isolation, when the source says this happened. I would like to know when. I have no recollection of training with that group, when they were all together. \"I know what training camps I was on and for me that is a total lie from someone that has very much an axe to grind with Team Sky.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Meanwhile, Team Sky's lead rider Chris Froome says the outfit are \"very different\" to what was said about them in the MPs' report \"I can only speak from my own experiences in the team,\" he told reporters before the Tirreno-Adriatico stage race in Italy, which starts on Wednesday. \"I've been there for eight years, since day one, when the team started. I certainly have a very different picture to what's been painted in the headlines.\" When asked about the specific 2012 allegation from the anonymous source, he added: \"No. That is absolute rubbish, I have seen that accusation, but no that is complete rubbish. \"I have never seen anything like that. It is not my experience within the team, that that is how the team operates.\" There have been calls for Sir David Brailsford to resign from his role as Team Sky's principal following the report, but Froome backed the 54-year-old. \"Dave B has brought all those people together and we have got a fantastic group of people,\" Froome said. \"I am proud to be part of the team. I would not have stayed so long, I would not have been in the team, I would not still be in the team, if I did not believe in the team and the people around me.\" Four-time Tour de France winner Froome finished 10th in February's Ruta del Sol race, his first since an adverse drugs test was made public. Froome has to explain to cycling's world governing body, the UCI, how he returned double the allowed level of legal asthma drug Salbutamol in his urine during his Vuelta a Espana victory in September.

        "content": "US President Donald Trump's top economic adviser Gary Cohn is resigning, the White House has said. It is the latest in a series of high-profile departures from President Trump's team. There has been speculation that Mr Cohn, a supporter of free trade, was angered by Mr Trump's plans to impose tariffs on aluminium and steel imports. In a statement released by the White House, Mr Cohn said it had been \"an honour to serve my country\". The 57-year-old former president of the Goldman Sachs bank had helped Mr Trump push through his sweeping tax reforms late last year. Why has Mr Cohn gone?\nGary Cohn and President Trump were never believed to be close. Mr Cohn wasn't specific about the reasons, saying in a statement it had been \"an honour to serve my country and enact pro-growth economic policies to benefit the American people, in particular the passage of historic tax reform\". Once that mission had been achieved, a number of differences may have prompted the departure, including the possible looming trade tariff war and his differences on that issue with trade adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. In August last year, Mr Cohn had also criticised Mr Trump over his reaction to a far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, saying the administration \"can and must do better\". He was reported to have drafted a resignation letter after the event. What has the White House said?\nAn official said: \"For several weeks Gary had been discussing with the president that it was nearing time for him to transition out.\" The exact departure date had yet to be determined The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House. Wrong! People will always come & go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos, only great Energy! End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump In a statement, Mr Trump said: \"Gary... did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping to deliver historic tax cuts and reforms and unleashing the American economy once again. \"He is a rare talent and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people.\" And the markets?\nAnalysts were pointing to the Cohn resignation as one reason behind a drop in shares across Asia on Monday. The Nikkei was off 0.77% and the Hang Seng 1.1%. Rick Meckler of LibertyView Capital Management told Reuters that Mr Cohn was \"very credible\" and the resignation announcement \"certainly causes short-term downward pressure\". The dollar continued its retreat against the yen, down from 113 at the start of the year to 105.6 on Wednesday. Does this herald a new direction?\nAnalysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Gary Cohn was a bit of a stranger in a strange land. He was a Democrat in a Republican White House; an economic globalist working for a president who campaigned on economic nationalism. Now, it seems, Donald Trump's protectionist bent has pushed the top administration economic adviser to the exit. This was not an unexpected development. By many accounts, there had been a contentious White House fight over whether to impose sweeping sanctions on US steel and aluminium imports - a tug-of-war that was settled, precipitously, by the president himself last week. There were the rumours that Mr Cohn was only sticking around to see last year's tax bill over the finish line, after his extreme discomfort following the president's warm words about some of the white nationalist marchers involved in violent clashes in Charlottesville last August. Mr Cohn was reportedly viewed by many Trump loyalists in the White House as an unwelcome interloper. Some on the outside, particularly in the financial world, welcomed him as a moderating influence - along with son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka. Now the former is leaving and the latter two seem greatly weakened. All this could mark sharp new direction in White House policy. What's the trade tariff dispute about?\nLast week, Mr Trump announced he would be imposing steep tariffs on steel and aluminium imports - 25% and 10% respectively. He is yet to sign them into effect. He has regularly argued that other countries have been \"taking advantage of\" the US on trade for decades. Trading partners reacted angrily. The EU, which says the steel and aluminium tariffs could cost it \u20ac2.8bn ($3.48bn; \u00a32.5bn) a year, has now drawn up a $3.5bn hit list of retaliatory tariffs. There are now fears of a global trade war. Mr Trump said on Tuesday: \"When we're behind on every single country, trade wars aren't so bad.\" But there is disquiet at his proposals even among members of Mr Trump's Republican party. Who will replace Mr Cohn?\nMr Trump tweeted that he would pick Mr Cohn's replacement \"soon\". \"Many people wanting the job - will choose wisely!\" he added. Possible candidates mooted by US media include Peter Navarro and Larry Kudlow, a conservative commentator and 2016 campaign adviser. President Trump tweeted that there was no chaos at the White House but there were \"still... some people that I want to change\". Who else has left the White House this year?\nA number have gone, adding to the string of senior figures who have left since Mr Trump took office. Hope Hicks - Mr Trump's press secretary quit a day after testifying to a congressional panel investigating Russian influence on the 2016 election, telling them she had occasionally told \"white lies\" for her boss Rob Porter - The White House staff secretary resigned after two of his ex-wives publicly accused him of physical and emotional domestic abuse Andrew McCabe - The FBI deputy director was forced out amid repeated criticism from Mr Trump that he was impartial in the Russia investigation ",

        "content": "The government's emergency committee Cobra is to be updated on the police probe into the suspected poisoning of a former Russian double agent. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, have spent a third night in a critical condition in hospital after being found unconscious in Salisbury. Scientists at the UK's military research facility at Porton Down are examining an \"unknown substance\". Met Police counter terrorism officers have extended cordons in the city. A bridge was shut on Tuesday evening, while Salisbury's Zizzi restaurant and The Bishop's Mill pub remain sealed off. Mr Skripal and his daughter were found slumped and unconscious on a bench outside the Maltings shopping centre on Sunday afternoon. The Cobra meeting will be chaired by Home Secretary Amber Rudd. The cross-departmental committee meets to examine government responses to national emergencies. Scotland Yard, which took over the investigation from Wiltshire Police on Tuesday, said it was keeping an \"open mind\" and the case had not been declared a terrorist incident. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said: \"This investigation is at the early stages and any speculation is unhelpful... \"We would like to reassure members of the public that this incident is being taken extremely seriously and we currently do not believe there is any immediate risk to the wider public.\" BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban said scientists at Porton Down have still not identified the substance the pair are thought to have been exposed to, with one official saying they were being treated for \"symptoms rather than causes\". Prof Alastair Hay, from the University of Leeds, said test results could take several days. He said: \"Individuals cannot provide unlimited amounts of blood for testing so investigations will be guided by the clinical team.\" Two police officers caught up in the suspected contamination were treated in hospital for minor symptoms, before they were given the all clear. It is understood their symptoms included itchy eyes and wheezing. A third member of the emergency services remains in hospital. Relatives of Col Skripal, who was convicted in Russia in 2006 of spying for Britain, have told the BBC Russian Service that he believed the country's special services might come after him at any time. His wife, elder brother and son have died in recent years, some in mysterious circumstances, the family believes. Ms Skripal lives in Moscow and has visited her father in the UK regularly, especially during the past two years. Family and friends told BBC Newsnight she did move to the UK with her family but missed Russia so returned to Moscow where she has worked for multinationals, including Nike and PepsiCo. It is thought her latest visit to the UK may have been timed to coincide with her late brother's birthday. Alexander Skripal died aged 43 last July in St Petersburg from liver failure in what relatives believe to have been suspicious circumstances, Newsnight said. He is buried in Salisbury close to his mother, Liudmila Skripal, who died of cancer in 2012. Newsnight's Mark Urban said that for years, Col Skripal's social life revolved around the MI6 people tasked to look after him. On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the case. He said that could include sanctions and asking UK dignitaries not to attend the World Cup in Russia this summer. The foreign secretary said he was not pointing fingers, but described Russia as \"a malign and disruptive force\". Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning The possibility of an unexplained substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko - a public inquiry concluded the killing of the Russian dissident had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, and says it is open to co-operating with British police if requested. In a statement, the Russian embassy in London said: \"Media reports create an impression of a planned operation by the Russian special services, which is completely untrue.\" Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI as part of a swap. He was later flown to the UK. According to BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban, in recent years Col Skripal gave lectures at military academies offering insight into Russia's foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU.

Now 50, Allegri was a creative midfielder who often scored goals in Italy's Serie A, albeit for smaller clubs such as Pescara and Cagliari. Nicknamed 'anchovy' for his thin frame, Allegri was not a sensational player, unlike other big-name Italian coaches such as Roberto Mancini, Carlo Ancelotti and Antonio Conte, but he certainly always thought he knew better than everyone else. \"Even when I was on the football pitch as a teenager, I wanted to be the teacher,\" Allegri wrote in a piece on the Players' Tribune website last year. \"I had a few passionate discussions with my own coaches, but it wasn't for more playing time or anything like that. It was because, even then, I wanted to run the team my own way.\" Playing career: Managerial career: His confidence is his most startling quality. He was called weak by many critics who watched as players like Zlatan Ibrahimovic seemed to impose their authority over his dressing room, something they would never do under the tutelage of a classic Italian authoritarian. Allegri sees it differently. He observes, he adapts, and he has no problems in looking at things from a different point of view. \"I change my mind because I do not consider it a weakness, but a way of growing up,\" explains Allegri. His former partners might disagree. In 1992, Corriere della Sera ran a piece titled, 'The escape of a footballer from the altar in the final hour'. The article described how the groom, a footballer, chose to cancel his wedding just before it was due to take place. The player who \"loved surprises\" and \"could turn a game upside down in the last minute\" had seemingly changed his mind. That player was Allegri and he has never quite shaken off the reputation for being the \"bride abandoner\". All his subsequent relationships have been documented in detail by Italy's tabloids. However, if constant change has afflicted his private life, it has helped his professional life to blossom. It was he who helped little Sassuolo reach Serie B for the first time in 2008, it was he who led Cagliari to a ninth-place finish in Serie A a year later, something they had not managed in close to 15 years - something he did despite losing his first five games - and it was Allegri who won AC Milan the title at the first time of asking in 2011, their first Scudetto since 2004. Yet nothing he has achieved in the past comes close to what he has managed at Juventus. Greeted on his arrival at the club by boos, tomatoes and whistles, Allegri was, in the eyes of the fans, no fit replacement for their former captain, legend and tactical maestro Antonio Conte when he left to manage the Italy national team in 2014. Conte had revived the Old Lady with his charisma, hard work and understanding of the Juve way and taken them to three successive titles in his three seasons in charge - their first since they were demoted to Serie B in the wake of the Calciopoli match-fixing scandal. How could Allegri, sacked by Milan, ever hope to match what his predecessor had achieved? Allegri has not just matched it. He has exceeded it, adding three more domestic titles and taking his side to two Champions League finals. There are manufactured coaches and natural coaches. I am one of the natural ones. I do not have to sit there and watch videos for hours. In a quarter of an hour, I understand Conte had dismissed Juve's hopes of making an impact in Europe, remarking: \"You cannot go to eat at a 100 euro restaurant with just 10 euros in your pocket, can you?\" But Allegri led that 10 euro squad to the Champions League final in 2015, impressing as he and his squad thrashed the likes of Real Madrid along the way, a club with more than a few million euros in their pocket. Under Allegri, Juventus grew in strength - physically, mentally and, most importantly, tactically. Evolution is the watchword for Allegri - his Juve side is constantly being remoulded, repackaged and rebuilt to devastating effect. The mark of a great coach is often held to be obsessive attention to detail - the opponent studied for days, the players well drilled on the tactical plan and the plays almost memorised as the players move as one, like actors on a stage. Allegri cares little for that. He is not interested in a style of play, in the philosophised construction of beautiful football, but rather in developing intelligent footballers who think for themselves. Tactical schemes are indeed taught, and the aim of the game is to have a side that can morph into various different shapes in order to achieve the best possible outcome. But Juventus are rarely beautiful. They are a team who work in the moment, knowing how to hinder the opponent from playing as well as exploiting their own opportunities to score. When asked why he continued his journey with the Old Lady after losing another Champions League final in 2017, Allegri wrote: \"I do this because I love teaching. It is truly the joy of my life. I like making players better and smarter.\" Every season Juventus have lost a champion yet gained in unity. The coach watched as Arturo Vidal was sold, Andrea Pirlo departed, Paul Pogba left, Alvaro Morata rejoined Real Madrid and Leonardo Bonucci jumped ship - and yet Juve still win. Three consecutive titles, three Coppa Italia trophies and two Champions League finals. Impressive for a coach who has previously confessed to deciding his line-up when he wakes up in the morning and to preparing for upcoming matches by only watching a few minutes' worth of videos. \"I always say that there are manufactured coaches and natural coaches,\" he said. \"I am one of the natural ones. I do not have to sit there and watch videos for hours. I look at what I have to watch and, in a quarter of an hour, I understand what I can understand.\" More than just winning trophies, Allegri developed Morata into a phenomenal footballer suited to the big occasions, turned Carlos Tevez into a real team player, Mario Mandzukic into an exemplary professional and, of course, got the best out of Pogba. While Conte is often credited for nurturing Pogba's talent, the truth is it was under Allegri that the youngster truly thrived. Thrilling in his final year before a then world-record return to Manchester United, the Frenchman revelled in his new creative role, where he, alongside Miralem Pjanic, delivered the highest number of assists in the league. However, as Tottenham discovered in Turin, and as Barcelona and Real Madrid had before them, Allegri makes mistakes. He played a 4-2-3-1 formation in the first leg against the Premier League side - and playing with only two midfielders against a side with Mousa Dembele within its ranks made little sense. Yet had Gonzalo Higuain taken his chances and Gianluigi Buffon not produced a rare error, Juve would have been 3-1 up in that tie and Allegri would have been applauded for a bold selection. As for the two Champions League final defeats in 2015 and 2017, the Juve coach may have bottled it or the Bianconeri may have just done what they have historically done all too often - lose a final. Allegri is still learning, still developing, but two finals in three years should be celebrated and not transformed into a stick with which to beat the man who has surpassed expectations. Beppe Marotta, Juve's sporting director, often repeats a quote of Nelson Mandela's: \"I don't lose, I either win or learn.\" That is the message Juve choose to live by. ",

        "content": "A video of a British diver swimming through swathes of rubbish off the coast of Bali has shown the extent of plastic waste floating in Indonesia's waters. The footage captured earlier this week by Rich Horner showed him swimming in Manta Point, a famous diving site about 20km from the popular tourist island. He told the BBC the sight was \"horrifying\". Is it normal to see so much plastic in Bali's waters?\nIt's no secret that Bali has a problem with rubbish, but even Mr Horner, a Bali resident, said he had \"never seen anything on this scale\" before. Similarly, a diving travel consultant in Bali told the BBC that it was \"quite uncommon\" to see such a large amount of trash. \"We had visitors go out to Manta Point just one day before Mr Horner did and they experienced beautiful waters,\" said Adriana Simeonova of the Aquamarine Diving Site. Where is it all coming from?\nBali sits in the middle of the Indonesian Throughflow, a current that streams from the Pacific Ocean into the Indian Ocean through the straits of Indonesia. This means that trash could either be local or brought in from as far away as the Pacific Ocean. \"The plastic I saw mainly had Indonesian labelling but because of the current, [the trash] could be coming from anywhere in Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia [or] beyond,\" said Mr Horner. This also means that the plastic could be swept away in a matter of a few hours or days - it all depends on the currents. \"The next day, divers who went to Manta Point report that they saw no plastic at all. Sadly [this means] the plastic is continuing its journey, off into the Indian Ocean,\" added Mr Horner. What is the government doing about this?\nEarlier last year, officials in Bali declared a \"garbage emergency\" across 3.7 miles (6km) of the island's beaches , deploying 700 cleaners and 35 trucks. On some days they collected up to 100 tons of trash. But Ms Simeonova says the problem isn't just limited to Bali. \"There's a lot of cleaning initiatives around Bali and regular beach clean ups, but the thing is that a lot of the rubbish is coming here from Java (Indonesia's main island).\" Indonesia's Minister of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries in a statement sent to the BBC, expressed sadness at the pile-up of rubbish in Manta Point, saying Indonesia \"must make the ocean our front porch, not our backyard\". Indonesia is currently the second-largest plastic polluter in the world, coming just behind China. It has said it aims to reduce marine plastic waste by 70% by 2025, but there is clearly a lot more work to be done. ",

        "content": "The government's emergency committee Cobra is to be updated on the police probe into the suspected poisoning of a former Russian double agent. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, have spent a third night in a critical condition in hospital after being found unconscious in Salisbury. Scientists at the UK's military research facility at Porton Down are examining an \"unknown substance\". Met Police counter terrorism officers have extended cordons in the city. A bridge was shut on Tuesday evening, while Salisbury's Zizzi restaurant and The Bishop's Mill pub remain sealed off. Mr Skripal and his daughter were found slumped and unconscious on a bench outside the Maltings shopping centre on Sunday afternoon. The Cobra meeting will be chaired by Home Secretary Amber Rudd. The cross-departmental committee meets to examine government responses to national emergencies. Scotland Yard, which took over the investigation from Wiltshire Police on Tuesday, said it was keeping an \"open mind\" and the case had not been declared a terrorist incident. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said: \"This investigation is at the early stages and any speculation is unhelpful... \"We would like to reassure members of the public that this incident is being taken extremely seriously and we currently do not believe there is any immediate risk to the wider public.\" BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban said scientists at Porton Down have still not identified the substance the pair are thought to have been exposed to, with one official saying they were being treated for \"symptoms rather than causes\". Prof Alastair Hay, from the University of Leeds, said test results could take several days. He said: \"Individuals cannot provide unlimited amounts of blood for testing so investigations will be guided by the clinical team.\" Two police officers caught up in the suspected contamination were treated in hospital for minor symptoms, before they were given the all clear. It is understood their symptoms included itchy eyes and wheezing. A third member of the emergency services remains in hospital. Relatives of Col Skripal, who was convicted in Russia in 2006 of spying for Britain, have told the BBC Russian Service that he believed the country's special services might come after him at any time. His wife, elder brother and son have died in recent years, some in mysterious circumstances, the family believes. Ms Skripal lives in Moscow and has visited her father in the UK regularly, especially during the past two years. Family and friends told BBC Newsnight she did move to the UK with her family but missed Russia so returned to Moscow where she has worked for multinationals, including Nike and PepsiCo. It is thought her latest visit to the UK may have been timed to coincide with her late brother's birthday. Alexander Skripal died aged 43 last July in St Petersburg from liver failure in what relatives believe to have been suspicious circumstances, Newsnight said. He is buried in Salisbury close to his mother, Liudmila Skripal, who died of cancer in 2012. Newsnight's Mark Urban said that for years, Col Skripal's social life revolved around the MI6 people tasked to look after him. On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the case. He said that could include sanctions and asking UK dignitaries not to attend the World Cup in Russia this summer. The foreign secretary said he was not pointing fingers, but described Russia as \"a malign and disruptive force\". During the urgent question in the Commons, Labour's Yvette Cooper raised reports by BuzzFeed that 14 deaths in the UK had been linked to Russia by US spy agencies. Ms Cooper, chairwoman of the Home Affairs select committee, asked Mr Johnson and the home secretary to order the National Crime Agency to urgently review the cases. Mr Johnson said there were \"a number of deeply troubling cases\" and he would \"certainly have that discussion with the home secretary\". Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning The possibility of an unexplained substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko - a public inquiry concluded the killing of the Russian dissident had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, and says it is open to co-operating with British police if requested. In a statement, the Russian embassy in London said: \"Media reports create an impression of a planned operation by the Russian special services, which is completely untrue.\" Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI as part of a swap. He was later flown to the UK. According to BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban, in recent years Col Skripal gave lectures at military academies offering insight into Russia's foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU.

        "content": "France plans to fix the legal age of sexual consent at 15, meaning sex with someone younger than that would be considered rape. Equality Minister Marl\u00e8ne Schiappa welcomed the move, which follows advice from doctors and legal experts. Currently, prosecutors must prove sex with someone under 15 was forced in order to bring rape charges. The change comes amid uproar over two recent cases of men accused of having sex with 11-year-old girls. Under the existing legislation, if there is no violence or coercion proved, offenders may only be charged with sexual abuse of a minor and not rape. This has a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of \u20ac75,000 (\u00a366,000; $87,000). Sentences are the same for sexual assaults of minors and non-minors, but rape convictions carry much harsher punishments. The government is to approve the new age limit as part of a package of other laws against sexual violence and harassment in the coming weeks. It had been discussing whether to set the age as 13 or 15, which is what groups fighting violence against children had campaigned for. Ms Schiappa told AFP news agency that she was \"very glad\" that the higher age was chosen. The limit is also supported by President Emmanuel Macron. Minister of Solidarity and Health Agn\u00e8s Buzyn said setting a legal age of sexual consent would allow a \"collective awareness\" and that everyone would see what was \"legal and illegal\", Le Figaro newspaper reports (in French). Last November, a 30-year-old man was acquitted of rape after a court determined his 11-year-old victim had not been subjected to \"constraint, threat, violence or surprise\". In another case, a court initially said a 28-year-old man should face charges of sexual assault, and not rape, after saying the victim was not physically forced to have sex. But the same court reversed its decision last month, saying the accused should indeed face rape charges. Legislation varies across Europe, with countries setting different legal ages of consent: In the UK the age of sexual consent is 16, but children under the age of 13 have additional legal protections that declare they can never consent to sexual activity.

It is the latest in a series of high-profile departures from President Trump's team. There has been speculation that Mr Cohn, a supporter of free trade, was angered by Mr Trump's plans to impose tariffs on aluminium and steel imports. In a statement released by the White House, Mr Cohn said it had been \"an honour to serve my country\". The 57-year-old former president of the Goldman Sachs bank had helped Mr Trump push through his sweeping tax reforms late last year. Why has Mr Cohn gone?\nGary Cohn and President Trump were never believed to be close. Mr Cohn wasn't specific about the reasons, saying in a statement it had been \"an honour to serve my country and enact pro-growth economic policies to benefit the American people, in particular the passage of historic tax reform\". Once that mission had been achieved, a number of differences may have prompted the departure, including the possible looming trade tariff war and his differences on that issue with trade adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Mr Cohn had reportedly set up a meeting between Mr Trump and business executives who opposed the tariffs move. But Mr Trump pulled out of that meeting and on Tuesday reportedly asked Mr Cohn in the Oval Office to back the tariffs publicly. Mr Cohn did not answer, sources told Bloomberg. In August last year, Mr Cohn had also criticised Mr Trump over his reaction to a far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, saying the administration \"can and must do better\". He was reported to have drafted a resignation letter after the event. What has the White House said?\nAn official said: \"For several weeks Gary had been discussing with the president that it was nearing time for him to transition out.\" The exact departure date had yet to be determined. The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House. Wrong! People will always come & go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos, only great Energy! End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump In a statement, Mr Trump said: \"Gary... did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping to deliver historic tax cuts and reforms and unleashing the American economy once again. \"He is a rare talent and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people.\" And the markets?\nAnalysts were pointing to the resignation of Mr Cohn, a free market advocate, as one reason behind a drop in shares across Asia on Wednesday. The Nikkei was off 0.77% and the Hang Seng 1.1%. Rick Meckler of LibertyView Capital Management told Reuters that Mr Cohn was \"very credible\" and the resignation announcement \"certainly causes short-term downward pressure\". The dollar continued its retreat against the yen, down from 113 at the start of the year to 105.6 on Wednesday. Does this herald a new direction?\nAnalysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Gary Cohn was a bit of a stranger in a strange land. He was a Democrat in a Republican White House; an economic globalist working for a president who campaigned on economic nationalism. Now, it seems, Donald Trump's protectionist bent has pushed the top administration economic adviser to the exit. This was not an unexpected development. By many accounts, there had been a contentious White House fight over whether to impose sweeping sanctions on US steel and aluminium imports - a tug-of-war that was settled, precipitously, by the president himself last week. There were the rumours that Mr Cohn was only sticking around to see last year's tax bill over the finish line, after his extreme discomfort following the president's warm words about some of the white nationalist marchers involved in violent clashes in Charlottesville last August. Mr Cohn was reportedly viewed by many Trump loyalists in the White House as an unwelcome interloper. Some on the outside, particularly in the financial world, welcomed him as a moderating influence - along with son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka. Now the former is leaving and the latter two seem greatly weakened. All this could mark a sharp new direction in White House policy. What's the trade tariff dispute about?\nLast week, Mr Trump announced he would be imposing steep tariffs on steel and aluminium imports - 25% and 10% respectively. He is yet to sign them into effect. He has regularly argued that other countries have been \"taking advantage of\" the US on trade for decades. Trading partners reacted angrily. The EU, which says the steel and aluminium tariffs could cost it \u20ac2.8bn ($3.48bn; \u00a32.5bn) a year, has now drawn up a $3.5bn hit list of retaliatory tariffs. There are now fears of a global trade war. Mr Trump said on Tuesday: \"When we're behind on every single country, trade wars aren't so bad.\" But there is disquiet at his proposals even among members of Mr Trump's Republican party. House Speaker Paul Ryan was one of those urging Mr Trump to have a \"smarter\" plan that was \"more surgical and more targeted\" and avoided the \"unintended consequences\" of a trade war. Who will replace Mr Cohn?\nMr Trump tweeted that he would pick Mr Cohn's replacement \"soon\". \"Many people wanting the job - will choose wisely!\" he added. Possible candidates mooted by US media include Peter Navarro and Larry Kudlow, a conservative commentator and 2016 campaign adviser. President Trump tweeted that there was no chaos at the White House but there were \"still... some people that I want to change\". Who else has left the White House this year?\nA number have gone, adding to the string of senior figures who have left since Mr Trump took office. Hope Hicks - Mr Trump's press secretary quit a day after testifying to a congressional panel investigating Russian influence on the 2016 election, telling them she had occasionally told \"white lies\" for her boss Rob Porter - The White House staff secretary resigned after two of his ex-wives publicly accused him of physical and emotional domestic abuse Andrew McCabe - The FBI deputy director was forced out amid repeated criticism from Mr Trump that he was impartial in the Russia investigation ",

        "content": "Ofgem has proposed new rules that it says would lead to UK consumers saving \u00a35bn on energy bills over five years. The regulator wants to cut how much consumers contribute towards energy network investment via their bills. Ofgem says the the proposals will lead to \u00a315-\u00a325 in savings per year for household consumer. The price controls will come into force in 2021 and significantly reduce the profits energy network companies receive. Energy giant National Grid said it would continue to work with Ofgem \"to achieve the best outcomes for all stakeholders\". \"We note the wide range of options the consultation document contains and acknowledge the focus on long-term thinking for critical infrastructure, incentive outperformance opportunities for well-run companies and the continuing alignment of consumer and shareholder interests,\" said a National Grid statement. Improving the grid\nEnergy network companies have invested \u00a3100bn into improving the national and local grids since 1990, and power cuts have almost halved since 2001. Ofgem says that under existing price controls it has put in place, the cost of transporting a unit of electricity around Britain has fallen by 17% since the mid 1990s. While investing in the energy network is important, the regulator said that network companies need to start consulting with consumers about their business plans, to ensure that they are in line with what consumers want and are willing to pay for. Ofgem also said that energy network companies needed to make use of the latest technologies to ensure that the grids continue to run reliably, as well as supporting new technologies such as electric vehicles, electricity storage, and local renewable generation. Technological savings\nHowever, if energy network companies made savings due to using technological innovations to make their networks more efficient, then they needed to share those savings with consumers. \"The energy sector is rapidly changing and consumers must be confident they continue to get good value for money for the services the networks deliver,\" said Jonathan Brearley, Ofgem's senior partner for networks. \"Ofgem's stable regulatory regime allows companies to attract investment from around the world on behalf of consumers in Great Britain at the lowest cost. We will capitalise on this by getting network companies to work harder to deliver better value for consumers in the next price controls.\" ",

        "content": "The founder of the Fyre Festival - a \"luxury\" festival in the Bahamas which was called a \"complete disaster\" by fans - has pleaded guilty to fraud. Billy McFarland, who co-founded the festival with rapper Ja Rule, admitted to using fake documents to attract investors to put more than $26m (\u00a318.7m) into his company. The 26-year-old's festival last April had boasted a bill including Skepta, Migos and Blink 182. He could face up to 40 years in prison. Tickets had cost between $1,200 and $100,000 (\u00a3860 and \u00a372,000), with more than 7,000 people expected to attend. Festival-goers were left stranded on an island in the Bahamas without enough food, water or accommodation. The festival had initially advertised with an Instagram video featuring models Bella Hadid, Hailey Baldwin and Emily Ratajkowski sailing on a luxury yacht. It was eventually cancelled and the organisers apologised and offered full refunds after negative publicity. Billy McFarland pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud, in connection with a scheme to defraud investors in his company Fyre Media Inc and a scheme to defraud a ticket vendor for the festival. A document from the US Department of Justice says that \"McFarland repeatedly made materially false statements to investors about Fyre Media's revenue and income, and manipulated Fyre Media's financial statements and supporting documentation to hide Fyre Media's true financial condition.\" Ja Rule was not arrested and there's no suggestion he had any involvement or connection with the fraud. At the time, festival-goers posted videos and photos online of the \"mass chaos\". One of the stranded people told Newsbeat in April last year that the event was the \"biggest scam ever\". \"It was truly the worst 27 hours of my life,\" said Lamaan El Gallal. \"They had instructed us not to bring any cash with us. Everything was inclusive and we had bands where we put money. \"But without cash, it was a huge problem.\" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

        "content": "A dying woman and her partner were the first same-sex couple to legally marry in Australia, it has been revealed. After the nation redefined its marriage law in December, Jo Grant and Jill Kindt obtained an exemption from an official waiting period. Ms Grant died from cancer on 30 January, less than seven weeks after marrying Ms Kindt. They had been together for eight years. \"Jo and I got to be legally married for 48 days - I'll take that,\" Ms Kindt. Their historic marriage was made public in Queensland's parliament by state Attorney-General Yvette D'Ath. \"I am honoured to reveal today that on December the 15th last year, despite what you may have seen reported in the media, Australia's first same-sex marriage was in fact actually held in Queensland,\" she said. Laws allowing same-sex couples to register for marriage had come into effect six days earlier, following a decisive public vote and approval by parliament. Some other same-sex couples, including others where one partner had a terminal illness, were also allowed to skip the waiting period and a handful of well-reported midnight celebrations took place. But the Queensland couple were married privately in their garden on the Sunshine Coast, surrounded by friends and family. Ms D'Ath said the marriage had been revealed now to parliament with family permission. She said officials went to \"extraordinary lengths\" to make Ms Grant and Ms Kindt's wedding happen quickly. The ceremony took place within 24 hours of the marriage being approved. Ms D'Ath said staff from Queensland Births, Deaths and Marriages drove about 100km (60 miles) to deliver paperwork to the marriage celebrant. Ms Grant had a \"rare cancer\" and had been receiving palliative care. She and Ms Kindt had held a commitment ceremony in 2013. \"We considered ourselves married [in 2013], but in a legal sense we weren't,\" said Ms Kindt, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corp.

        "content": "The government's emergency committee Cobra is to be updated on the police probe into the suspected poisoning of a former Russian double agent. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, have spent a third night in a critical condition in hospital after being found unconscious in Salisbury. Scientists at the UK's military research facility at Porton Down are examining an \"unknown substance\". Met Police counter terrorism officers extended cordons in the city overnight. A bridge was shut on Tuesday evening, while Salisbury's Zizzi restaurant and The Bishop's Mill pub remain sealed off. Mr Skripal and his daughter were found slumped and unconscious on a bench outside the Maltings shopping centre on Sunday afternoon. The Cobra meeting will be chaired by Home Secretary Amber Rudd. The cross-departmental committee meets to examine government responses to national emergencies. Scotland Yard, which took over the investigation from Wiltshire Police on Tuesday, said it was keeping an \"open mind\" and the case had not been declared a terrorist incident. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said: \"This investigation is at the early stages and any speculation is unhelpful. \"We would like to reassure members of the public that this incident is being taken extremely seriously and we currently do not believe there is any immediate risk to the wider public.\" BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban said scientists at Porton Down have still not identified the substance the pair are thought to have been exposed to, with one official saying they were being treated for \"symptoms rather than causes\". Prof Alastair Hay, from the University of Leeds, said test results could take several days. He said: \"Individuals cannot provide unlimited amounts of blood for testing so investigations will be guided by the clinical team.\" Two police officers caught up in the suspected contamination were treated in hospital for minor symptoms, before they were given the all clear. It is understood their symptoms included itchy eyes and wheezing. A third member of the emergency services remains in hospital. Relatives of Col Skripal, who was convicted in Russia in 2006 of spying for Britain, have told the BBC Russian Service that he believed the country's special services might come after him at any time. His wife, elder brother and son have died in recent years, some in mysterious circumstances, the family believes. Ms Skripal lives in Moscow and has visited her father in the UK regularly, especially during the past two years. Family and friends told BBC Newsnight she did move to the UK with her family but missed Russia so returned to Moscow where she has worked for multinationals, including Nike and PepsiCo. It is thought her latest visit to the UK may have been timed to coincide with her late brother's birthday. Alexander Skripal died aged 43 last July in St Petersburg from liver failure in what relatives believe to have been suspicious circumstances, Newsnight said. He is buried in Salisbury close to his mother, Liudmila Skripal, who died of cancer in 2012. Newsnight's Mark Urban said that for years, Col Skripal's social life revolved around the MI6 people tasked to look after him. On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the case. He said that could include sanctions and asking UK dignitaries not to attend the World Cup in Russia this summer. The foreign secretary said he was not pointing fingers, but described Russia as \"a malign and disruptive force\". During the urgent question in the Commons, Labour's Yvette Cooper raised reports by BuzzFeed that 14 deaths in the UK had been linked to Russia by US spy agencies. Ms Cooper, chairwoman of the Home Affairs select committee, asked Mr Johnson and the home secretary to order the National Crime Agency to urgently review the cases. Mr Johnson said there were \"a number of deeply troubling cases\" and he would \"certainly have that discussion with the home secretary\". Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning The possibility of an unexplained substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko - a public inquiry concluded the killing of the Russian dissident had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, and says it is open to co-operating with British police if requested. In a statement, the Russian embassy in London said: \"Media reports create an impression of a planned operation by the Russian special services, which is completely untrue.\" Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI as part of a swap. He was later flown to the UK. According to BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban, in recent years Col Skripal gave lectures at military academies offering insight into Russia's foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU.

Since 2013, attendances for UK women's sports have grown, on average, 38% year-on-year, according to sports marketing agency Two Circles. They now predict the number of fans watching women's sport will increase by 16% on 2017 to hit 682,000 in 2018. They say growth has been driven by increased awareness and media coverage. Meanwhile recent major international tournaments hosted in the UK, such as the 2017 ICC Women Cricket World Cup, which sold-out three games including the final, have boosted interest and viewing numbers. On Saturday, Harlequins Ladies rugby club are set to achieve a world record attendance for a women's club match when it hosts Richmond in the Tyrrells Premier 15s at the Twickenham Stoop. Cricket's Kia Super League, football's Women's Super League and netball's Vitality Superleague have all contributed significantly to the growth in attendances. This year's attendance figures will also receive a boost from the Women's Hockey World Cup at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park this July and August. \"Fans will pay to watch quality, elite sport and rights-holders prepared to invest in both women's teams and events are reaping the rewards as interest in women's sport continues to grow,\" said Gareth Balch, chief executive of Two Circles.

        "content": "Media playback is not supported on this device Sir Bradley Wiggins and former Team Sky doctor Richard Freeman need to \"come forward and tell the truth\", says the team's ex-coach Shane Sutton. An MPs' report says Team Sky \"crossed an ethical line\" by using drugs allowed under anti-doping rules to enhance performance instead of just for medical purposes. Wiggins was named but told the BBC he is \"100%\" not a cheat. \"They need to explain it all to everybody,\" Sutton told Sky Sports. The report by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee said Team Sky used the anti-inflammatory drug triamcinolone to prepare Britain's most decorated Olympian Wiggins and a smaller group of riders for the Tour de France, which he won in 2012. Asthmatic Wiggins was granted therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) to take the corticosteroid triamcinolone, which can treat allergies and respiratory issues, shortly before the 2011 Tour de France, his 2012 Tour win and the 2013 Giro d'Italia. But the report says he used it as many as nine times in four years, which Wiggins described as \"completely malicious\". He added he took it just once out of competition - which is legal - \"after the 2013 Giro d'Italia, when I came out with a knee problem\". \"I cannot say I know a lot about Brad's use of it in or out of competition,\" said Sutton, who was also a former technical director for British Cycling. \"I am told by the doctor he needs a TUE for this event etcetera etcetera. Outside of the event, you have to sit down and ask them. \"I call for the doctor and Brad to come forward and answer these questions, they are not for me. \"I am calling for him and the doctor to come forward and tell the truth. \"He is a sufferer, I have seen him suffer and gasping for breath after effort, I saw what he was going though, I cannot answer how often he used it. Only the doctor and him can tell us. \"They need to explain it all to everybody and everyone knows the word cheat needs to be taken out of the equation. The report says he did not cheat, so come forward and tell everyone what you administered, when, and let us put it to bed.\" Sutton, who gave evidence to the committee last year, was also asked about a treatment administered to Wiggins on the team bus after winning the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine. Freeman and Wiggins say the cyclist was treated some hours later at a training camp - a point Freeman reiterated to Sky Sports following Sutton's interview. However, Sutton said: \"I understand he was treated on the bus, I thought it was public knowledge. This goes back to 12 months ago, when I was interviewed, that is the statement I made, that is what the doctor told me.\" Sutton did, though, question the evidence of an anonymous \"well-placed\" source who told the committee that Team Sky used triamcinolone to prepare Wiggins and a smaller group of riders for the 2012 Tour. \"I totally refute that,\" Sutton said. \"What you have to remember is that Brad and I worked in isolation, when the source says this happened. I would like to know when. I have no recollection of training with that group, when they were all together. \"I know what training camps I was on and for me that is a total lie from someone that has very much an axe to grind with Team Sky.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Meanwhile, Team Sky's lead rider Chris Froome says the outfit are \"very different\" to what was said about them in the MPs' report \"I can only speak from my own experiences in the team,\" he told reporters before the Tirreno-Adriatico stage race in Italy, which starts on Wednesday. \"I've been there for eight years, since day one, when the team started. I certainly have a very different picture to what's been painted in the headlines.\" When asked about the specific 2012 allegation from the anonymous source, he added: \"No. That is absolute rubbish, I have seen that accusation, but no that is complete rubbish. \"I have never seen anything like that. It is not my experience within the team, that that is how the team operates.\" There have been calls for Sir David Brailsford to resign from his role as Team Sky's principal following the report, but Froome backed the 54-year-old. \"Dave B has brought all those people together and we have got a fantastic group of people,\" Froome said. \"I am proud to be part of the team. I would not have stayed so long, I would not have been in the team, I would not still be in the team, if I did not believe in the team and the people around me.\" Four-time Tour de France winner Froome finished 10th in February's Ruta del Sol race, his first since an adverse drugs test was made public. Froome has to explain to cycling's world governing body, the UCI, how he returned double the allowed level of legal asthma drug Salbutamol in his urine during his Vuelta a Espana victory in September. Christian Prudhomme, the race director of the Tour de France, has criticised the delay by the UCI in making a decision on Froome's case. May's Giro d'Italia is the first of 2018's Grand Tours followed by the Tour in July and Vuelta a Espana which starts in August. \"In December I said we wanted a rapid response. Now, we can remove the word 'rapid'. We want a response [from the UCI].\" the Frenchman told RMC Sport. \"The organisers need a response, not just for us at the Tour de France but for all the organisers, so that there isn't a rider they'll later say shouldn't have been at the start. It's completely grotesque.\" Meanwhile, Floyd Landis says Wiggins should now be stripped of his 2012 Tour de France title. American Landis, who lost the Tour de France title he won in 2006 after a positive test for testosterone, believes Wiggins should now be suspended and have his 2012 victory stricken from records. Landis was a former team-mate of Lance Armstrong's and initially denied doping before becoming the chief whistleblower in a federal case against cycling's most recognised name. \"Wiggins should lose his Tour title,\" Landis told cyclingnews. \"I can't see how the sport authorities can let it slide. You can't take them seriously if they don't act. \"There's a report right there for them and for me WADA have no choice but to suspend him and take his title away. If they were legitimate, that's what they'd do.\" ",

        "content": "Rolls-Royce swung back into profit in 2017 amid an ongoing restructuring drive at the engine maker. It comes after the firm posted the biggest loss in its history in 2016 due to settling corruption cases and currency hedges going wrong. In the year to 31 December 2017 profit before tax jumped to \u00a34.9bn - up from a loss of \u00a34.6bn the year before. Revenue climbed 9% to \u00a316.3bn. Chief executive Warren East said the firm was making \"good progress\". Profits were boosted by the delivery of more aero-engines, and by its power systems unit which makes large diesel engines. It also saw a \u00a32.6bn accounting boost from the recent strengthening of the pound. Engine troubles\nHowever, the firm said its 2018 figures could be impacted by the cost of carrying out repairs on its Trent 1000 engines, which have suffered technical problems. In December, Air New Zealand became the latest airliner to ground some of its flights because of problems with the engines. Japan's ANA and Virgin Atlantic have also reported problems. Mr East told the BBC: \"First you have to realise that all mechanical things wear out over time, and some of the parts in our Trent 1000 engines are wearing out faster than we originally forecast. \"We're having to manage the operational impacts because it's quite disruptive for our customers. \"We do know how to fix it. It will take some years actually to fully implement the modifications in all the engines which are in service.\" Job losses?\nMr East said Rolls-Royce continued to expand and would power around half of the world's wide body aircraft within a few years - up from a third currently. To cut costs it will also restructure its business from five business units into three - although Mr East declined to comment on whether this would cost jobs. The firm employs around 22,000 people in the UK, accounting for one in every 250 jobs in the country. \"It is too early to comment on specific numbers of jobs, but what I have been talking about for some time is we need to simplify our operation,\" he said. \"Clearly it's a much simpler structure if we are in three units instead of five.\" ",

It is keen to cash in on the country's growing taste for Chu-Hi - canned sparkling flavoured drinks given a kick with a local spirit called shochu. The product is typically between 3% and 8% alcohol by volume. A senior Coke executive in Japan said the move was a \"modest experiment for a specific slice of our market\". Highball\n\"We haven't experimented in the low alcohol category before, but it's an example of how we continue to explore opportunities outside our core areas,\" said Jorge Garduno, Coca-Cola's Japan president. It was unlikely the drink would be sold outside of Japan, he suggested. Chu-Hi - an abbreviation for shochu highball - has been marketed as an alternative to beer, proving especially popular with female drinkers. Japan's big drinks firms including Kirin, Suntory and Asahi all have varieties of the drink, and continue to experiment with hundreds of flavours. 'Premium segments'\nAs younger consumers become more health conscious, Coca-Cola has been diversifying from fizzy drinks, including buying water and tea brands. But last November, Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog speculated that Coca-Cola might move into alcohol, as it looked to \"premium segments such as adult craft beverages\". The phrase alcopop typically refers to sweet but alcoholic drinks, and in 1990s UK brands such as Hooch, Reef, Smirnoff Ice and Bacardi Breezer became hugely popular. But they were controversial. raising concerns that they encouraged young people to drink alcohol in large quantities because they were so easy to consume. ",

        "content": "US President Donald Trump's top economic adviser Gary Cohn is resigning, the White House has said. It is the latest in a series of high-profile departures from President Trump's team. There has been speculation that Mr Cohn, a supporter of free trade, was angered by Mr Trump's plans to impose tariffs on aluminium and steel imports. In a statement released by the White House, Mr Cohn said it had been \"an honour to serve my country\". The 57-year-old former president of the Goldman Sachs bank had helped Mr Trump push through his sweeping tax reforms late last year. Why has Mr Cohn gone?\nGary Cohn and President Trump were never believed to be close. Mr Cohn wasn't specific about the reasons, saying in a statement it had been \"an honour to serve my country and enact pro-growth economic policies to benefit the American people, in particular the passage of historic tax reform\". Once that mission had been achieved, a number of differences may have prompted the departure, including the possible looming trade tariff war and his differences on that issue with trade adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Mr Cohn had reportedly set up a meeting between Mr Trump and business executives who opposed the tariffs move. But Mr Trump pulled out of that meeting and on Tuesday reportedly asked Mr Cohn in the Oval Office to back the tariffs publicly. Mr Cohn did not answer, sources told Bloomberg. In August last year, Mr Cohn had also criticised Mr Trump over his reaction to a far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, saying the administration \"can and must do better\". He was reported to have drafted a resignation letter after the event. What has the White House said?\nAn official said: \"For several weeks Gary had been discussing with the president that it was nearing time for him to transition out.\" The exact departure date had yet to be determined. The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House. Wrong! People will always come & go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos, only great Energy! End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump In a statement, Mr Trump said: \"Gary... did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping to deliver historic tax cuts and reforms and unleashing the American economy once again. \"He is a rare talent and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people.\" And the markets?\nAnalysts were pointing to the resignation of Mr Cohn, a free market advocate, as one reason behind a drop in shares across Asia on Wednesday. The Nikkei closed 0.77% down and the Hang Seng 1.03%. Rick Meckler of LibertyView Capital Management told Reuters that Mr Cohn was \"very credible\" and the resignation announcement \"certainly causes short-term downward pressure\". The dollar continued its retreat against the yen, down from 113 at the start of the year to 105.6 on Wednesday. European stocks also opened lower, the FTSE 100 and pan-Europe STOXX 600 falling about 0.5% after opening. Does this herald a new direction?\nAnalysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Gary Cohn was a bit of a stranger in a strange land. He was a Democrat in a Republican White House; an economic globalist working for a president who campaigned on economic nationalism. Now, it seems, Donald Trump's protectionist bent has pushed the top administration economic adviser to the exit. This was not an unexpected development. By many accounts, there had been a contentious White House fight over whether to impose sweeping sanctions on US steel and aluminium imports - a tug-of-war that was settled, precipitously, by the president himself last week. There were the rumours that Mr Cohn was only sticking around to see last year's tax bill over the finish line, after his extreme discomfort following the president's warm words about some of the white nationalist marchers involved in violent clashes in Charlottesville last August. Mr Cohn was reportedly viewed by many Trump loyalists in the White House as an unwelcome interloper. Some on the outside, particularly in the financial world, welcomed him as a moderating influence - along with son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka. Now the former is leaving and the latter two seem greatly weakened. All this could mark a sharp new direction in White House policy. What's the trade tariff dispute about?\nLast week, Mr Trump announced he would be imposing steep tariffs on steel and aluminium imports - 25% and 10% respectively. He is yet to sign them into effect. He has regularly argued that other countries have been \"taking advantage of\" the US on trade for decades. Trading partners reacted angrily. The EU, which says the steel and aluminium tariffs could cost it \u20ac2.8bn ($3.48bn; \u00a32.5bn) a year, has now drawn up a $3.5bn hit list of retaliatory tariffs. There are now fears of a global trade war. Mr Trump said on Tuesday: \"When we're behind on every single country, trade wars aren't so bad.\" But there is disquiet at his proposals even among members of Mr Trump's Republican party. House Speaker Paul Ryan was one of those urging Mr Trump to have a \"smarter\" plan that was \"more surgical and more targeted\" and avoided the \"unintended consequences\" of a trade war. Who will replace Mr Cohn?\nMr Trump tweeted that he would pick Mr Cohn's replacement \"soon\". \"Many people wanting the job - will choose wisely!\" he added. Possible candidates mooted by US media include Peter Navarro and Larry Kudlow, a conservative commentator and 2016 campaign adviser. President Trump tweeted that there was no chaos at the White House but there were \"still... some people that I want to change\". Who else has left the White House this year?\nA number have gone, adding to the string of senior figures who have left since Mr Trump took office. Hope Hicks - Mr Trump's press secretary quit a day after testifying to a congressional panel investigating Russian influence on the 2016 election, telling them she had occasionally told \"white lies\" for her boss Rob Porter - The White House staff secretary resigned after two of his ex-wives publicly accused him of physical and emotional domestic abuse Andrew McCabe - The FBI deputy director was forced out amid repeated criticism from Mr Trump that he was impartial in the Russia investigation ",

The Jamiacan, 23, who won the 110m world title in a time of 13.04 seconds last year, has a personal best of 12.90 and was favoured for gold in Australia. However, he revealed in January that he was doubtful to compete at the Games on the Gold Coast starting on 4 April. He also missed last week's World Indoor Championships because of visa issues. Asked about McLeod's non-selection for the Games in Australia, Jamaica Athletics Administrative Association president Warren Blake told Reuters: \"He did not make himself available, as simple as that.\" McLeod ran the first leg for Jamaica in the 4x100m relay final at the World Championships in London last year, when the legendary Usain Bolt's final race ended in a fall. In the absence of McLeod, Olympic bronze medallist Hansle Parchment, Ronald Levy and world under-18 champion Dejour Russell will represent the Caribbean nation in the 110m hurdles. Andrew Pozzi, who won the men's 60m hurdles gold at the World Indoor Athletics Championships in Birmingham last weekend, is among England's entrants in the 110m hurdles.

        "content": "Saudi Arabia's crown prince is starting a three-day visit to the UK amid protests planned against his country's role in the war in Yemen. Mohammed bin Salman, 32, is seen by some as a modernising force in the Gulf State. He is due to hold talks with Theresa May and have lunch with the Queen. The UK hopes to capitalise on the Saudi economy's opening-up but No 10 said the PM would also express \"deep concern\" at the humanitarian situation in Yemen. Demonstrators are expected to protest outside Downing Street against the killing of Yemeni civilians in air strikes by a Saudi-led multinational coalition - backed by the UK and US - that is battling the rebel Houthi movement The crown prince, who is regarded as being heir presumptive to the 82-year old King Salman, is making his first visit to the UK since taking up the role last year. He will also have dinner with the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge. He is credited with kick-starting economic and social reforms in the conservative desert kingdom, such as the upcoming lifting of the ban on women driving. He also launched an anti-corruption drive that saw princes, ministers and influential businessmen detained and generated an estimated $106bn (\u00a376bn) in settlements. However, many have criticised his decisions to intervene in Yemen and impose a de facto blockade of neighbouring Qatar, as well as crack down on perceived opponents of his policies. A new Strategic Partnership Council will be established which it is hoped could lead to Saudi investment in and through the UK of up to \u00a3100bn during the next 10 years. 'Saudis high on wish list'\nBy BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale When this relative novice on the world stage arrives in London on his first global tour since taking office, he will be granted the reddest of red carpets. The Crown Prince is looking for international support for his internal economic reforms while at the same time trying to offer reassurance to nervous international investors. And the British government is keen to transform a security and defence relationship into one that includes broader economic ties as well. The UK also has an unashamed appetite for inward investment from Saudi Arabia. In other words, post-Brexit Britain will need allies, markets and money - and the Saudis are high on the UK's wish list. Read more from James The conflict in Yemen is seen as part of a regional power struggle between Saudi Arabia, which backs the government, and Iran, which supports the Houthis but denies allegations that it is sending them weapons. According to the United Nations, more than 9,000 people, over half of them civilians, have been killed and more than 52,000 injured in fighting in Yemen since March 2015. Downing Street said Mrs May would \"acknowledge the steps\" taken recently by Saudi Arabia to address the crisis but will stress the importance of \"full and unfettered humanitarian and commercial access\" through rebel-held ports under partial blockade by the coalition. The PM will also call for urgent progress on securing a political resolution to the crisis, her spokesman said. But Emily Thornberry, the foreign affairs spokeswoman for Labour, the UK's main opposition party, urged Mrs May to use the UK's influence to call on Saudi Arabia \"to stop\" the bombing in Yemen. \"We're in a unique position to be able to intervene in this and to stop the war in Yemen and to do that as a friend,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"I would say our relationship with you is important - we need to be friends - but that it would be wrong for us to lie to you. \"You're going too far in relation to what you're doing in Yemen. \"We're very concerned that you in Saudi Arabia now believe that can win the war in Yemen - you can't win the war in Yemen - we all know that in our heart of hearts.\" Anti-war campaigners, including the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, have accused the UK government, a leading exporter of arms to the Saudi capital Riyadh, of being \"complicit\" in coalition bombings in Yemen.

        "content": "The rate of house price growth in the UK slumped to just 1.8% in the year to February, according to the country's largest lender, the Halifax. That is the slowest rate of increase since March 2013. The Halifax said that the average price of a home has fallen from \u00a3226,408 in November, to \u00a3224,353 last month. That is a fall of \u00a32,055. However, prices actually rose by 0.4% in February, following two months in which values declined. The Halifax said it expected price growth to remain low in the months ahead. Nevertheless it said low mortgage rates and flourishing job prospects would continue to support prices. \"The labour market continues to perform strongly, with the number of people in employment rising by 88,000 in the three months to December,\" said Russell Galley, managing director of the Halifax. \"While we expect price growth to remain low, the low mortgage rate environment, combined with an ongoing shortage of properties for sale, should continue to support house prices over the coming months.\" Some experts said it was good news that price rises were moderating, making it easier for first-time buyers to enter the market.

        "content": "The government's emergency committee Cobra is to be updated on the police probe into the suspected poisoning of a former Russian double agent. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, have spent a third night in a critical condition in hospital after being found unconscious in Salisbury. Scientists at the UK's military research facility at Porton Down are examining an \"unknown substance\". Met Police counter terrorism officers extended cordons in the city overnight. A bridge was shut on Tuesday evening, while Salisbury's Zizzi restaurant and The Bishop's Mill pub remain sealed off. Mr Skripal and his daughter were found slumped and unconscious on a bench outside the Maltings shopping centre on Sunday afternoon. The Cobra meeting, due to begin shortly, will be chaired by Home Secretary Amber Rudd. The cross-departmental committee meets to examine government responses to national emergencies. Scotland Yard, which took over the investigation from Wiltshire Police on Tuesday, said it was keeping an \"open mind\" and the case had not been declared a terrorist incident. BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban said scientists at Porton Down have still not identified the substance the pair are thought to have been exposed to, with one official saying they were being treated for \"symptoms rather than causes\". Prof Alastair Hay, from the University of Leeds, said test results could take several days. Two police officers caught up in the suspected contamination were treated in hospital for minor symptoms - believed to be itchy eyes and wheezing - before they were given the all clear. A third member of the emergency services remains in hospital. Relatives of Col Skripal, who was convicted in Russia in 2006 of spying for Britain, have told the BBC Russian Service that he believed the country's special services might come after him at any time. His wife, elder brother and son have died in recent years, some in mysterious circumstances, the family believes. Ms Skripal lives in Moscow and has visited her father in the UK regularly, especially during the past two years. Family and friends say she did move to the UK but missed Russia so returned to Moscow where she has worked for multinationals, including Nike and PepsiCo. It is thought her latest visit to the UK may have been timed to coincide with her late brother's birthday. Alexander Skripal died aged 43 last July in St Petersburg from liver failure in what relatives believe to have been suspicious circumstances, Newsnight said. He is buried in Salisbury close to his mother, Liudmila Skripal, who died of cancer in 2012. On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the case. He said that could include sanctions and asking UK dignitaries not to attend the World Cup in Russia this summer. The foreign secretary said he was not pointing fingers, but described Russia as \"a malign and disruptive force\". During the urgent question in the Commons, Labour's Yvette Cooper raised reports by BuzzFeed that 14 deaths in the UK had been linked to Russia by US spy agencies. Ms Cooper, chairwoman of the Home Affairs select committee, asked Mr Johnson and the home secretary to order the National Crime Agency to urgently review the cases. Mr Johnson said there were \"a number of deeply troubling cases\" and he would \"certainly have that discussion with the home secretary\". Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning The possibility of an unexplained substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko - a public inquiry concluded the killing of the Russian dissident had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Former MI5 officer Annie Machon pointed out that the two cases were very different, however. Mr Litvinenko was a whistleblower, a dissident and a consultant for MI6 actively at the time of his death, she said, whereas Mr Skripal has already been caught, convicted and pardoned and allowed to freely find safe haven in the UK. \"There's no conceivable reason that I can see that the Russian state would have been targeting him at the moment,\" she told BBC's Breakfast. \"That's why we need to think about what else he might have been involved in.\" Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, and says it is open to co-operating with British police if requested. In a statement, the Russian embassy in London said: \"Media reports create an impression of a planned operation by the Russian special services, which is completely untrue.\" Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Col Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years. Do you have any information to share on this story?

        "content": "An engine fault that grounded planes at British Airways and other airliners will take \"some years\" to fix, Rolls-Royce has said. The aerospace giant said parts in its Trent 1000 engines were wearing out faster than expected but that it \"had a solution\" to the problem. It came as Rolls-Royce reported better-than-expected results for 2017, following a record loss in 2016. However, it signalled job losses ahead as the firm continues to cut costs. In December, Air New Zealand became the latest airliner to ground some of its flights because of problems with its Rolls-Royce engines. Japan's ANA and Virgin Atlantic have also had problems. Rolls-Royce said up to 500 Trent 1000 engines - used on Boeing 787 planes - and some Trent 900 engines had technical problems. Boss Warren East told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"First you have to realise that all mechanical things wear out over time, and some of the parts in our Trent engines are wearing out faster than we originally forecast. 'We have a plan'\n\"We're having to manage the operational impacts because it's quite disruptive for our customers.\" He added: \"We have a solution, we have a plan, it will take some years to fully implement the modifications in all the engines which are in service.\" The firm reported better than expected earnings for 2017, with profits before tax of \u00a34.6bn. It follows a \u00a34.6bn loss in 2016 - the largest in Rolls-Royce's history - due to settling corruption cases and currency hedges going wrong, among other factors. The news pushed shares in the company up by more than 14%. The firm attributed its performance to stronger sales of aero and diesel engines, as well as a \u00a32.6bn accounting boost from the recent strengthening of the pound. Job losses?\nHowever, it said its 2018 figures could be impacted by the cost of carrying out the Trent engine repairs, and also that it would push ahead with a plan to \"simplify its staff structure\" to cut costs. This would see it reduce its number of business divisions from five to three. Mr East suggested corporate roles would be affected but stressed the revamp was not set to affect engineers or technologists. It comes after around 600 managers have left the group since 2015 under a previous overhaul. Rolls-Royce employs around 22,000 people in the UK, accounting for one in every 250 jobs in the country. \"It is too early to comment on specific numbers of job losses, but what I have been talking about for some time is we need to simplify our operation,\" Mr East said.

        "content": "Ambulances and emergency response vehicles were deployed more than 1,500 times to five patients in 12 months, the BBC has learned. A total of 8,303 emergency calls were made by the five most frequent UK callers. An NHS spokesman said the calls were often related to mental health, chronic pain and alcohol or drug dependence. Vicki Nash from mental health charity Mind said the figures show that individuals' needs were not being met. The figures were released after a Freedom of Information request to the UK's 14 ambulance trusts. The highest number of calls by a single patient were made to London's ambulance service, which was contacted 3,594 times. Other services to receive frequent calls include East Midlands Ambulance service, which was called 1,244 times by a single patient, and South West Ambulance service, which received 1,044 calls from one person. \"Frequent callers\" are classed as those who call at least five times in a month, or at least 12 times in three months, and they cost the health service almost \u00a319m a year. Paul Jefferies, assistant director of operations at South Central Ambulance Service, said about 10% of the calls they receive are from frequent callers. He said: \"If the ambulance, or the response vehicle, is being deployed to that patient who we know is a frequent caller, it means that a resource might not be available for a potential cardiac arrest.\" 'Huge' impact\nMs Nash, head of policy and campaigns for Mind, said the figures showed the service being offered was not good enough. She said: \"It's not meeting the needs of that individual, which is why they are repeatedly calling.\" A West Midlands Ambulance service spokesman said misuse of the 999 number had a \"huge\" impact. He said: \"It's not just the financial cost, it is the effective removal of ambulances for people who really need them that is the greatest concern.\" The trusts work with other agencies such as social services to put in place care packages that will stop individuals calling inappropriately, he added. A Department of Health spokesman said: \"NHS 999 call handlers do a challenging job helping callers seeking assistance in an emergency, and we expect the public to support them in their vital role by only calling 999 if necessary.\" ",

        "content": "A BBC journalist has alleged that she was sexually harassed by the senior Russian politician Leonid Slutsky. BBC Russian Service's Farida Rustamova is the third journalist to openly accuse him of improper behaviour. The Duma deputy denied the accusations and has threatened to take the women to court for defamation. Russia has not had the same backlash against sexual harassment as seen in the US and Western Europe in the wake of high profile scandals. 'Lost for words'\nMs Rustamova recorded audio of the incident, which took place a year ago. The recording is in the BBC's possession, but it has decided not to publish it. On 24 March 2017, Farida Rustamova visited Leonid Slutsky, head of the foreign affairs committee, at his parliamentary office to get a comment about the then French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen's visit to Russia. During the conversation, Mr Slutsky unexpectedly changed the subject and asked if she would like to leave the BBC to work for him. When Ms Rustamova refused, he complained: \"You're trying to get away from me, you don't want to kiss me, you've hurt my feelings.\" In the recording, Ms Rustamova can be heard explaining that she has a boyfriend that she hopes to marry. \"Great, you'll be his wife, and my mistress,\" Mr Slutsky says. Our correspondent says the politician then approached her and, in her words, began \"running his hand, the flat of his palm, up against my nether region\". Sexual harassment in Russia\n\"I didn't understand what had happened,\" Ms Rustamova says. \"I was just lost for words, muttering funny noises, I just went numb. I blurted out something about not coming to him again, that he had felt me up.\" Judging by his response, which was also caught on the recording, Mr Slutsky did not agree with her description of events. \"I don't feel people up. Well, OK, just a little. 'Feel people up' is an ugly expression,\" he said. The BBC has asked Mr Slutsky to comment on the events of 24 March 2017, but he has not responded. Ms Rustamova joins two journalists - TV channel RTVI deputy editor Yekaterina Kotrikadze and TV Rain producer Daria Zhuk - who have both, in the last two weeks, accused Mr Slutsky of sexual impropriety. Mr Slutsky acknowledged the scandal after President Putin's state address last week, suggesting it was a political plot. \"They've made them write about this,\" he told BBC correspondents. \"People are unhappy that the authority of the foreign affairs committee, including the committee chairperson, has increased. \"This is a typical example, I'm afraid, of made-to-order journalism that, instead of diminishing our authority, has probably strengthened it.\" The State Duma - Russia's lower house - has emphasised that Mr Slutsky's guilt has not been proven and encouraged alleged victims to file a report with the parliament's ethics committee. In comments to Russian newspaper Vedomosti on Wednesday, the speaker of the Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin, said: \"Let's leave politics to politicians. We'll look into it. But there are always two sides to a story. \"So if, following a legal process, this turns out to be a provocation, then what do we do? If you offend somebody, you should apologise. If you provoke somebody, you should bear responsibility.\" He also said that female journalists who felt afraid to cover the Russian parliament should seek work elsewhere. Ms Rustamova is currently preparing her statement to the State Duma MPs' ethics committee. She says that Leonid Slutsky has made no attempt to apologise to her over the past year. Russian law does not cover sexual harassment. Oksana Pushkin, a deputy at the State Duma, told the BBC that the law that prohibits coercive actions of a sexual nature (article 133 of Russia's Penal Code) \"does not, in reality, work\". ",

        "content": "The founder of the Fyre Festival - a \"luxury\" festival in the Bahamas which was called a \"complete disaster\" by fans - has pleaded guilty to fraud. Billy McFarland, who co-founded the festival with rapper Ja Rule, admitted to using fake documents to attract investors to put more than $26m (\u00a318.7m) into his company. The 26-year-old's festival last April had boasted a bill including Skepta, Migos and Blink 182. He could face up to 40 years in prison. Tickets had cost between $1,200 and $100,000 (\u00a3860 and \u00a372,000), with more than 7,000 people expected to attend. Festival-goers were left stranded on an island in the Bahamas without enough food, water or accommodation. The festival had initially advertised with an Instagram video featuring models Bella Hadid, Hailey Baldwin and Emily Ratajkowski sailing on a luxury yacht. It was eventually cancelled and the organisers apologised and offered full refunds after negative publicity. Billy McFarland pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud, in connection with a scheme to defraud investors in his company Fyre Media Inc and a scheme to defraud a ticket vendor for the festival. A document from the US Department of Justice says that \"McFarland repeatedly made materially false statements to investors about Fyre Media's revenue and income, and manipulated Fyre Media's financial statements and supporting documentation to hide Fyre Media's true financial condition.\" Ja Rule was not arrested and there's no suggestion he had any involvement or connection with the fraud. At the time, festival-goers posted videos and photos online of the \"mass chaos\". So Fyre Fest is a complete disaster. Mass chaos. No organization. No one knows where to go.

Tooting High Street was shut in the early hours of Wednesday, causing rush hour disruption. Police tweeted a picture of the scene, near Tooting Broadway Station, that was strewn with debris as water gushed from a crack in the pavement. It is not known if the burst pipe was damaged in recent severe cold weather. Thames Water said its engineers reached the scene \"very quickly\" and have stopped the flooding. Mitcham Road remains closed both ways between Longmead Road and Tooting High Street. Transport for London said Tooting Broadway Station remained fully open and trains were stopping as normal. ",

        "content": "An engine fault that grounded planes at British Airways and other airliners will take \"some years\" to fix, Rolls-Royce has said. The aerospace giant said parts in its Trent 1000 engines were wearing out faster than expected but that it \"had a solution\" to the problem. It came as Rolls-Royce reported better-than-expected results for 2017, following a record loss in 2016. However, it signalled job losses ahead as the firm continues to cut costs. In December, Air New Zealand became the latest airliner to ground some of its flights because of problems with its Rolls-Royce engines. It said there had been \"two recent events\" involving Trent 1000 engines, one which required the plan to return to the airport after take-off. Japan's ANA and Virgin Atlantic have also had problems. Rolls-Royce said up to 500 Trent 1000 engines - used on Boeing 787 planes - and some Trent 900 engines had technical problems. Boss Warren East told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"First you have to realise that all mechanical things wear out over time, and some of the parts in our Trent engines are wearing out faster than we originally forecast. 'We have a plan'\n\"We're having to manage the operational impacts because it's quite disruptive for our customers.\" He added: \"We have a solution, we have a plan, it will take some years to fully implement the modifications in all the engines which are in service.\" The firm reported better than expected earnings for 2017, with profits before tax of \u00a34.9bn. It follows a \u00a34.6bn loss in 2016 - the largest in Rolls-Royce's history - due to settling corruption cases and currency hedges going wrong, among other factors. The news pushed shares in the company up by more than 14%. The firm attributed its performance to stronger sales of aero and diesel engines, as well as a \u00a32.6bn accounting boost from the recent strengthening of the pound. Job losses?\nHowever, it said its 2018 figures could be impacted by the cost of carrying out the Trent engine repairs, and also that it would push ahead with a plan to \"simplify its staff structure\" to cut costs. This would see it reduce its number of business divisions from five to three. Mr East suggested corporate roles would be affected but stressed the revamp was not set to affect engineers or technologists. It comes after around 600 managers have left the group since 2015 under a previous overhaul. Rolls-Royce employs around 22,000 people in the UK, accounting for one in every 250 jobs in the country. \"It is too early to comment on specific numbers of job losses, but what I have been talking about for some time is we need to simplify our operation,\" Mr East said.

        "content": "The rate of house price growth in the UK slumped to just 1.8% in the year to February, according to the country's largest lender, the Halifax. That is the slowest rate of increase since March 2013. The Halifax said that the average price of a home has fallen from \u00a3226,408 in November, to \u00a3224,353 last month. That is a fall of \u00a32,055. However, prices actually rose by 0.4% in February, following two months in which values declined. The Halifax said it expected price growth to remain low in the months ahead. Nevertheless it said low mortgage rates and flourishing job prospects would continue to support prices. \"The labour market continues to perform strongly, with the number of people in employment rising by 88,000 in the three months to December,\" said Russell Galley, managing director of the Halifax. \"While we expect price growth to remain low, the low mortgage rate environment, combined with an ongoing shortage of properties for sale, should continue to support house prices over the coming months.\" Some experts said it was good news that price rises were moderating, making it easier for first-time buyers to enter the market. However Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item club, said it was further evidence that 2018 was going to be a difficult year for the housing market. \"Activity is expected to remain lacklustre as the extended squeeze on consumer purchasing power only gradually eases, confidence is fragile and appreciable caution persists over engaging in major transactions,\" he said. \"Potential house buyers also look highly likely to face further interest rate hikes in 2018.\" Where can you afford to live?

        "content": "Ofgem has proposed new rules that it says would lead to UK consumers saving \u00a35bn on energy bills over five years. The regulator wants to cut how much consumers contribute towards energy network investment via their bills. Ofgem says the the proposals will lead to \u00a315-\u00a325 in savings per year for household consumer. The price controls will come into force in 2021 and significantly reduce the profits energy network companies receive. National Grid, which runs Britain's main energy infrastructure, said it would continue to work with Ofgem \"to achieve the best outcomes for all stakeholders\". The firm said it appreciated that Ofgem was taking into consideration key concerns for its business. These considerations include the need to plan for long-term investment in critical infrastructure, as well as the need to ensure that both consumers and shareholders were kept happy. Improving the grid\nEnergy network companies have invested \u00a3100bn into improving the national and local grids since 1990, and power cuts have almost halved since 2001. Ofgem says that under existing price controls it has put in place, the cost of transporting a unit of electricity around Britain has fallen by 17% since the mid 1990s when calculated by the retail price index measure of inflation. While investing in the energy network is important, the regulator said that network companies need to start consulting with consumers about their business plans, to ensure that they are in line with what consumers want and are willing to pay for. Ofgem also said that energy network companies needed to make use of the latest technologies to ensure that the grids continue to run reliably, as well as supporting new technologies such as electric vehicles, electricity storage, and local renewable generation. However, if energy network companies made savings due to using technological innovations to make their networks more efficient, then they needed to share those savings with consumers. \"Unjustified profits\"\nIn July 2017, Citizens Advice released a report analysing all of the companies in the UK that transport gas and electricity. The report claimed that energy network companies had made \u00a37.5bn in \"unjustified\" profits. At the time, the Energy Networks Association (ENA) said it disagreed with the modelling used by Citizens Advice for its report. Responding to Ofgem's latest initiative, Gillian Guy, chief executive at Citizens Advice said: \"Today's announcement is a major step forward. \"These proposals should prevent a repeat of the billions in excess profits energy network companies are making under the current price controls. This means better value for consumers and potentially lower bills.\" She added: \"The outcome of this consultation will be the acid test for Ofgem. It's crucial that the regulator holds its nerve and sees through these changes. \"Curbing the ability of energy network companies to make excessive profits, limiting the price control to five years, and ensuring a greater voice for consumers are all measures that should take us closer to a towards an energy market that genuinely works for consumers.\" In response to Ofgem's proposals, ENA's chief executive David Smith said that energy networks were at the heart of a \"smarter, cleaner energy market\", and that if the industry was expected to enable consumers to use new services like electrical vehicles, then the new price control regulations needed to be \"balanced\". Mr Smith added that ENA was happy to set up consumer engagement groups to improve customer satisfaction. \"The energy sector is rapidly changing and consumers must be confident they continue to get good value for money for the services the networks deliver,\" said Jonathan Brearley, Ofgem's senior partner for networks. \"Ofgem's stable regulatory regime allows companies to attract investment from around the world on behalf of consumers in Great Britain at the lowest cost. We will capitalise on this by getting network companies to work harder to deliver better value for consumers in the next price controls.\" ",

Gwala's training partner Sandile Shange told the BBC the 26-year-old is stable in hospital and his injuries are not life-threatening. The attack reportedly happened in the early hours of Wednesday in Durban while Gwala was on a training ride. The men cut into both of Gwala's legs before he was able to escape. \"He thought they were coming to rob him, stopped and gave them his phone but they didn't want his phone, didn't want his watch or bicycle,\" Shange said. \"They dragged him to the side of the road to some bushes, took a saw and started cutting his legs. \"They kept on cutting and when they got to the bone, because the saw was not that sharp, the saw got stuck. When they saw it was getting stuck they started on the other leg.\" South African Olympic triathlon bronze medallist Henri Schoeman called the incident \"disgusting\" on Twitter. Gwala was due to compete in the South African national championships this month. \"When he spoke to doctors they said they will be able to save his leg and he will be able to walk and run again but it is a long walk to recovery,\" Shange said.

        "content": "Police investigating the suspected poisoning of a former Russian double agent want to speak to anyone who visited Salisbury on Sunday afternoon. Officers are keen to speak to anyone who went to Zizzi restaurant or The Bishop's Mill pub in the town centre. The appeal comes as the government's emergency committee Cobra meets to be updated on the investigation. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, remain critically ill after being found unconscious on Sunday. The pair were found slumped on a bench outside the Maltings shopping centre. Scientists at the UK's military research facility at Porton Down are examining an \"unknown substance\". In the latest police statement, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, head of Counter Terrorism Policing, said: \"The two people taken ill were in Salisbury centre from around 13:30 GMT. \"Did you see anything out of the ordinary? It may be that at the time, nothing appeared out of place or untoward but with what you now know, you remember something that might be of significance. \"Your memory of that afternoon and your movements alone could help us with missing pieces of the investigation. \"The weather was poor that day so there were not as many people out and about. Every statement we can take is important,\" he added. Cordons have been erected around the town centre, with another now in place near Solstice Park, a business park in Amesbury, a town about 10 miles from Salisbury. This is linked to the investigation and is a precautionary measure, the police said. The Cobra meeting is being chaired by Home Secretary Amber Rudd. The cross-departmental committee meets to examine government responses to national emergencies. BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban said scientists at Porton Down have still not identified the substance the pair are thought to have been exposed to, with one official saying they were being treated for \"symptoms rather than causes\". Prof Alastair Hay, from the University of Leeds, said test results could take several days. Two police officers caught up in the suspected contamination were treated in hospital for minor symptoms - believed to be itchy eyes and wheezing - before they were given the all clear. A third member of the emergency services remains in hospital. Relatives of Col Skripal, who was convicted in Russia in 2006 of spying for Britain, have told the BBC Russian Service that he believed the country's special services might come after him at any time. His wife, elder brother and son have died in recent years, some in mysterious circumstances, the family believes. Ms Skripal lives in Moscow and has visited her father in the UK regularly, especially during the past two years. Family and friends say she did move to the UK but missed Russia so returned to Moscow where she has worked for multinationals, including Nike and PepsiCo. It is thought her latest visit to the UK may have been timed to coincide with her late brother's birthday. Alexander Skripal died aged 43 last July in St Petersburg from liver failure in what relatives believe to have been suspicious circumstances, Newsnight said. He is buried in Salisbury close to his mother, Liudmila Skripal, who died of cancer in 2012. On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the case. He said that could include sanctions and asking UK dignitaries not to attend the World Cup in Russia this summer. The foreign secretary said he was not pointing fingers, but described Russia as \"a malign and disruptive force\". During the urgent question in the Commons, Labour's Yvette Cooper raised reports by BuzzFeed that 14 deaths in the UK had been linked to Russia by US spy agencies. Ms Cooper, chairwoman of the Home Affairs select committee, asked Mr Johnson and the home secretary to order the National Crime Agency to urgently review the cases. Mr Johnson said there were \"a number of deeply troubling cases\" and he would \"certainly have that discussion with the home secretary\". Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning The possibility of an unexplained substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko - a public inquiry concluded the killing of the Russian dissident had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Former MI5 officer Annie Machon pointed out that the two cases were very different, however. Mr Litvinenko was a whistleblower, a dissident and a consultant for MI6 actively at the time of his death, she said, whereas Mr Skripal has already been caught, convicted and pardoned and allowed to freely find safe haven in the UK. \"There's no conceivable reason that I can see that the Russian state would have been targeting him at the moment,\" she told BBC's Breakfast. \"That's why we need to think about what else he might have been involved in.\" Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, and says it is open to co-operating with British police if requested. In a statement, the Russian embassy in London said: \"Media reports create an impression of a planned operation by the Russian special services, which is completely untrue.\" Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Col Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years. Do you have any information to share on this story?

        "content": "The first polar bear cub to be born in the UK for 25 years has emerged at the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland's Highland Wildlife Park at Kincraig. Previously, the birth had only been confirmed by high-pitched noises heard from the maternity den. The cub was born in the week before Christmas, after its mother Victoria mated with Arktos, one of two male polar bears at the park. Victoria's enclosure has been closed to the public. It is expected to be reopened to park visitors later this month. The first image of the cub is from footage filmed by STV Productions for a Channel 4 documentary. Una Richardson, head keeper responsible for carnivores, said: \"Victoria had started to come outside by herself for short periods to eat, drink and roll around in the snow, so we knew her cub would soon follow her but we couldn't be sure when. \"I was visiting Victoria on Sunday morning to check she had fresh water and to continue slowly reintroducing food to her diet, after four months during which she lived solely off the fat reserves she built up before she entered her den. \"Suddenly I saw a small, fluffy bundle next to her and had to pinch myself to check I wasn't seeing things. It was a very special experience and one I'll never forget. We also have motion-sensitive cameras safely positioned near Victoria's den and we were delighted to see we had captured her cub's first few steps outside. \"Having only been able to hear sounds from inside the den before, we can now be certain Victoria has had one cub rather than two and we couldn't be happier as this is the moment we have been working towards and really looking forward to. \"Both mum and cub appear to be doing well, though this is still a sensitive time and they need as much peace and quiet as possible. Our keeper activity at their enclosure will remain at a minimum for the next couple of weeks, after which visitors will be able to see Victoria and our wonderful new arrival. \"In the coming weeks we'll also be able to find out if we have a little boy or girl and then we'll decide on a name.\" Bear necessities: A brief guide to polar cubs\n",

Gwala's training partner Sandile Shange told the BBC the 26-year-old is stable in hospital and his injuries are not life-threatening. The attack reportedly happened in the early hours of Tuesday in Durban while Gwala was on a training ride. The men cut into both of Gwala's legs before he was able to escape. Police spokesperson Nqobile Gwala told the BBC that a case of attempted murder is being investigated. \"He thought they were coming to rob him, stopped and gave them his phone but they didn't want his phone, didn't want his watch or bicycle,\" Shange said. \"They dragged him to the side of the road to some bushes, took a saw and started cutting his legs. \"They kept on cutting and when they got to the bone, because the saw was not that sharp, the saw got stuck. When they saw it was getting stuck they started on the other leg.\" South African Olympic triathlon bronze medallist Henri Schoeman called the incident \"disgusting\" on Twitter. Gwala was due to compete in the South African national championships this month. \"When he spoke to doctors they said they will be able to save his leg and he will be able to walk and run again but it is a long walk to recovery,\" Shange said.

        "content": "The European Parliament has set out the kind of relationship it wants the EU to have with the UK after Brexit. The draft resolution, leaked to the Politico website, says that continued UK membership of the single market and customs union is the preferred option of MEPs. The parliament does not have a formal role in the Brexit negotiations but does have a veto on the final deal. The European Union publishes its own guidelines for future talks later. The European Parliament document, which may be changed before it is adopted later on Wednesday, says non-EU members - even if very closely aligned to the bloc - cannot expect the same rights and benefits as EU members. It also warns that the UK's current \"red lines\" in Brexit talks \"would lead to customs checks and verification which would affect global supply chains and manufacturing processes, even if tariff barriers can be avoided\". It says a \"deep and comprehensive\" trade deal, of the kind envisioned by Theresa May, must entail \"a binding interpretation role\" for the European Court of Justice. The European Parliament resolution also warns the UK against \"cherry-picking of sectors of the internal market\". BBC Brussels Correspondent Adam Fleming said the draft will look like a rejection of the speech Theresa May delivered on Friday, setting out her vision of post-Brexit trade, but with some \"wriggle room\" and the possibility of much more if the UK softens some of its red lines. European Parliament Brexit chief Guy Verhofstadt met UK ministers in Downing Street on Tuesday for talks on the rights of EU citizens in the EU, and vice versa, after Brexit. The European Parliament is due to vote on the resolution, the fourth it has issued on Brexit, next week. ",

Layla Rose Ermenekli was taken to Royal Oldham Hospital with a high temperature, leg and stomach pains and a tell-tale rash on her hip, and died eight hours later. Dr Harsha Rajanna said he asked her mother Kirsty about the hip mark and was told she bumped into a table. Mrs Ermenekli said the exchange never happened. The hearing was told that Layla, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, was a lively girl who loved playing with her friends and dancing. She became ill in February last year and was taken to the hospital's accident and emergency department. She was triaged as \"priority two\" at 20:55 GMT and should have been seen by a doctor within 10 minutes, but Dr Rajanna did not see her until 22:50 GMT. Mrs Ermenekli told the inquest he said Layla could go home and she felt pressured to take her. A nurse called in junior doctor Imogen Buck who saw the non-blanching rash - a \"classic indicator\" of meningitis. Layla was transferred to a high dependency unit but died of meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia hours later. Dr Rajanna told the inquest he noticed Layla's hip mark and thought it was a bruise, but made no note of it. When asked why, he said Mrs Ermenekli had told him the child had bumped into a table, which she denies. He said she wanted to take Layla home but he recommended she be seen by the paediatric team. A lawyer representing Layla's family said: \"Either your recollection is wrong or you are giving dishonest evidence to this court.\" The coroner asked Dr Buck why she did not challenge Dr Rajanna after Layla died and she said felt it \"wasn't appropriate\". The health trust has already apologised to the family for the quality of care received. The hearing continues. ",

        "content": "Wales coach Warren Gatland has made 10 changes for Sunday's Six Nations match with Italy in Cardiff. Liam Williams, Steff Evans, Hadleigh Parkes, Gareth Davies and Cory Hill survive from the 37-27 loss in Ireland. Scarlets flanker James Davies will win his first cap in a back row which sees Taulupe Faletau return at number eight to captain the team. Gareth Anscombe is named at fly-half with Northampton Saints' George North selected on the right wing. An all-new front row sees hooker Elliot Dee make his first start alongside Nicky Smith and Tomas Francis, with Bradley Davies joining Hill in the second row. Justin Tipuric is selected at blindside flanker to complete a mobile-looking back row. Behind the scrum Williams moves from wing to full-back to make way for North, while Ospreys centre Owen Watkin will make his first Six Nations start. Gatland believes the team boasts a lot of quality despite the sweeping changes. \"We are bringing in a lot of quality and a lot of experience with the likes of Bradley Davies, Justin Tipuric, George North and Taulupe,\" he said. \"Add into that James Davies who gets his first cap, Elliot Dee who gets his first start - this is a great opportunity for them to play tournament rugby. \"It is challenging making changes, but we have picked a really exciting team and Sunday is their chance. \"It is a great opportunity for Taulupe, he is a world class player, hugely experienced and this will be great for his development and we are looking forward to seeing those leadership qualities come through.\" Wales: L Williams, North, Watkin, Parkes, S Evans; Anscombe, G Davies; Smith, Dee, Francis, Hill, B Davies, Tipuric, J Davies, Faletau (capt).

        "content": "Coca-Cola is planning to produce an alcoholic drink for the first time in the company's 125-year history - with an alcopop-style product in Japan. It is keen to cash in on the country's growing taste for Chu-Hi - canned sparkling flavoured drinks given a kick with a local spirit called shochu. The product is typically between 3% and 8% alcohol by volume. A senior Coke executive in Japan said the move was a \"modest experiment for a specific slice of our market\". Highball\n\"We haven't experimented in the low alcohol category before, but it's an example of how we continue to explore opportunities outside our core areas,\" said Jorge Garduno, Coca-Cola's Japan president. It was unlikely the drink would be sold outside of Japan, he suggested. Chu-Hi - an abbreviation for shochu highball - has been marketed as an alternative to beer, proving especially popular with female drinkers. Japan's big drinks firms including Kirin, Suntory and Asahi all have varieties of the drink, and continue to experiment with flavours. The most popular flavours are strong citrus ones such as grapefruit or lemon, but the drink can also be made with other fruit flavours like grape, apple and peach. 'Premium segments'\nAs younger consumers become more health conscious, Coca-Cola has been diversifying from fizzy drinks, including buying water and tea brands. But last November, Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog speculated that Coca-Cola might move into alcohol, as it looked to \"premium segments such as adult craft beverages\". The phrase alcopop typically refers to sweet but alcoholic drinks, and in 1990s UK brands such as Hooch, Reef, Smirnoff Ice and Bacardi Breezer became hugely popular. But they were controversial. raising concerns that they encouraged young people to drink alcohol in large quantities because they were so easy to consume. ",

        "content": "Police investigating the suspected poisoning of a former Russian double agent want to speak to anyone who visited Salisbury on Sunday afternoon. Officers are keen to speak to anyone who went to Zizzi restaurant or The Bishop's Mill pub in the town centre. The appeal comes as the government's emergency committee Cobra meets to be updated on the investigation. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, remain critically ill after being found unconscious on Sunday. The pair were found slumped on a bench outside the Maltings shopping centre. Scientists at the UK's military research facility at Porton Down are examining an \"unknown substance\". In the latest police statement, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, head of Counter Terrorism Policing, said: \"The two people taken ill were in Salisbury centre from around 13:30 GMT. \"Did you see anything out of the ordinary? It may be that at the time, nothing appeared out of place or untoward but with what you now know, you remember something that might be of significance. \"Your memory of that afternoon and your movements alone could help us with missing pieces of the investigation. \"The weather was poor that day so there were not as many people out and about. Every statement we can take is important,\" he added. Cordons have been erected around the town centre, with another now in place near Solstice Park, a business park in Amesbury, a town about 10 miles from Salisbury. This is linked to the investigation and is a precautionary measure, the police said. The Cobra meeting is being chaired by Home Secretary Amber Rudd. The cross-departmental committee meets to examine government responses to national emergencies. BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban said scientists at Porton Down have still not identified the substance the pair are thought to have been exposed to, with one official saying they were being treated for \"symptoms rather than causes\". Prof Alastair Hay, from the University of Leeds, said test results could take several days. Two police officers caught up in the suspected contamination were treated in hospital for minor symptoms - believed to be itchy eyes and wheezing - before they were given the all clear. A third member of the emergency services remains in hospital. Relatives of Col Skripal, who was convicted in Russia in 2006 of spying for Britain, have told the BBC Russian Service that he believed the country's special services might come after him at any time. It has been said his only friends in the UK are in the British intelligence services, but he has also joined his local railway club and given lectures at military academies. His wife, elder brother and son have all died in recent years, some in mysterious circumstances, the family believes. Ms Skripal lives in Moscow and has visited her father in the UK regularly, especially during the past two years. Family and friends say she did move to the UK but missed Russia so returned to Moscow where she has worked for multinationals, including Nike and PepsiCo. It is thought her latest visit to the UK may have been timed to coincide with her late brother's birthday. Alexander Skripal died aged 43 last July in St Petersburg from liver failure in what relatives believe to have been suspicious circumstances, Newsnight said. He is buried in Salisbury close to his mother, Liudmila Skripal, who died of cancer in 2012. On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the case. He said that could include sanctions and asking UK dignitaries not to attend the World Cup in Russia this summer. The foreign secretary said he was not pointing fingers, but described Russia as \"a malign and disruptive force\". During the urgent question in the Commons, Labour's Yvette Cooper raised reports by BuzzFeed that 14 deaths in the UK had been linked to Russia by US spy agencies. Ms Cooper, chairwoman of the Home Affairs select committee, asked Mr Johnson and the home secretary to order the National Crime Agency to urgently review the cases. Mr Johnson said there were \"a number of deeply troubling cases\" and he would \"certainly have that discussion with the home secretary\". Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning The possibility of an unexplained substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko - a public inquiry concluded the killing of the Russian dissident had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Former MI5 officer Annie Machon pointed out that the two cases were very different, however. Mr Litvinenko was a whistleblower, a dissident and a consultant for MI6 actively at the time of his death, she said, whereas Mr Skripal has already been caught, convicted and pardoned and allowed to freely find safe haven in the UK. \"There's no conceivable reason that I can see that the Russian state would have been targeting him at the moment,\" she told BBC's Breakfast. \"That's why we need to think about what else he might have been involved in.\" Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, and says it is open to co-operating with British police if requested. In a statement, the Russian embassy in London said: \"Media reports create an impression of a planned operation by the Russian special services, which is completely untrue.\" Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Col Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years. Do you have any information to share on this story?

        "content": "US President Donald Trump's top economic adviser Gary Cohn is resigning, the White House has said. It is the latest in a series of high-profile departures from President Trump's team. There has been speculation that Mr Cohn, a supporter of free trade, was angered by Mr Trump's plans to impose tariffs on aluminium and steel imports. In a statement released by the White House, Mr Cohn said it had been \"an honour to serve my country\". The 57-year-old former president of the Goldman Sachs bank had helped Mr Trump push through his sweeping tax reforms late last year. Why has Mr Cohn gone?\nGary Cohn and President Trump were never believed to be close. Mr Cohn wasn't specific about the reasons, saying in a statement it had been \"an honour to serve my country and enact pro-growth economic policies to benefit the American people, in particular the passage of historic tax reform\". Once that mission had been achieved, a number of differences may have prompted the departure, including the possible looming trade tariff war and his differences on that issue with trade adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Mr Cohn had reportedly set up a meeting between Mr Trump and business executives who opposed the tariffs move. But Mr Trump pulled out of that meeting and on Tuesday reportedly asked Mr Cohn in the Oval Office to back the tariffs publicly. Mr Cohn did not answer, sources told Bloomberg. In August last year, Mr Cohn had also criticised Mr Trump over his reaction to a far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, saying the administration \"can and must do better\". He was reported to have drafted a resignation letter after the event. What has the White House said?\nAn official said: \"For several weeks Gary had been discussing with the president that it was nearing time for him to transition out.\" The exact departure date had yet to be determined. The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House. Wrong! People will always come & go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos, only great Energy! End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump In a statement, Mr Trump said: \"Gary... did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping to deliver historic tax cuts and reforms and unleashing the American economy once again. \"He is a rare talent and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people.\" And the markets?\nAnalysts were pointing to the resignation of Mr Cohn, a free market advocate, as one reason behind a drop in shares across Asia on Wednesday. The Nikkei closed 0.77% down and the Hang Seng 1.03%. Rick Meckler of LibertyView Capital Management told Reuters that Mr Cohn was \"very credible\" and the resignation announcement \"certainly causes short-term downward pressure\". The dollar continued its retreat against the yen, down from 113 at the start of the year to 105.6 on Wednesday. European stocks also opened lower, the FTSE 100 and pan-Europe STOXX 600 falling about 0.5% after opening. Does this herald a new direction?\nAnalysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Gary Cohn was a bit of a stranger in a strange land. He was a Democrat in a Republican White House; an economic globalist working for a president who campaigned on economic nationalism. Now, it seems, Donald Trump's protectionist bent has pushed the top administration economic adviser to the exit. This was not an unexpected development. By many accounts, there had been a contentious White House fight over whether to impose sweeping sanctions on US steel and aluminium imports - a tug-of-war that was settled, precipitously, by the president himself last week. There were the rumours that Mr Cohn was only sticking around to see last year's tax bill over the finish line, after his extreme discomfort following the president's warm words about some of the white nationalist marchers involved in violent clashes in Charlottesville last August. Mr Cohn was reportedly viewed by many Trump loyalists in the White House as an unwelcome interloper. Some on the outside, particularly in the financial world, welcomed him as a moderating influence - along with son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka. Now the former is leaving and the latter two seem greatly weakened. All this could mark a sharp new direction in White House policy. What's the trade tariff dispute about?\nLast week, Mr Trump announced he would be imposing steep tariffs on steel and aluminium imports - 25% and 10% respectively. He is yet to sign them into effect. He has regularly argued that other countries have been \"taking advantage of\" the US on trade for decades. Trading partners reacted angrily. The EU, which says the steel and aluminium tariffs could cost it \u20ac2.8bn ($3.48bn; \u00a32.5bn) a year, has now drawn up a $3.5bn hit list of retaliatory tariffs. There are now fears of a global trade war. Mr Trump said on Tuesday: \"When we're behind on every single country, trade wars aren't so bad.\" But there is disquiet at his proposals even among members of Mr Trump's Republican party. House Speaker Paul Ryan was one of those urging Mr Trump to have a \"smarter\" plan that was \"more surgical and more targeted\" and avoided the \"unintended consequences\" of a trade war. Who will replace Mr Cohn?\nMr Trump tweeted that he would pick Mr Cohn's replacement \"soon\". \"Many people wanting the job - will choose wisely!\" he added. Possible candidates mooted by US media include Peter Navarro and Larry Kudlow, a conservative commentator and 2016 campaign adviser. President Trump tweeted that there was no chaos at the White House but there were \"still... some people that I want to change\". 'Sensible adult' leaves: US media on Cohn's departure\nA piece in Bloomberg carries the concerns of Wall St operators that the White House is losing experienced financial experts. Kathy Wylde, who runs the Partnership for New York City, says: \"Gary was one that we counted on.\" A Washington Post article headlined \"Gary Cohn didn't get much done. But it could be worse - and it probably will\" says the adviser was an \"odd duck\" but that it is hard to fault him, given \"the Trump administration has been too understaffed and unfocused to get much done\". An editorial in the New York Times says Gary Cohn was \"supposed to be among the sensible adults in the room. Now, he is leaving after failing repeatedly to be the stabilising influence that the Trump administration sorely needed\". Bill Powell in Newsweek says there are two things Donald Trump really likes - a rising stock market and tariffs. But one thing the resignation of Gary Cohn makes abundantly clear, he says, is that \"you can't have both... the world just doesn't work that way\". ",

Mr Litvinenko was a whistleblower, a dissident and a consultant for MI6 actively at the time of his death, she said, whereas Mr Skripal has already been caught, convicted and pardoned and allowed to freely find safe haven in the UK. \"There's no conceivable reason that I can see that the Russian state would have been targeting him at the moment,\" she told BBC's Breakfast. \"That's why we need to think about what else he might have been involved in.\" Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, and says it is open to co-operating with British police if requested. In a statement, the Russian embassy in London said: \"Media reports create an impression of a planned operation by the Russian special services, which is completely untrue.\" Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Col Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years. Do you have any information to share on this story?

        "content": "European Council President Donald Tusk is unveiling the EU's approach to the next phase of Brexit talks on future relations with the UK. The strategy must be signed off by EU leaders at a summit later this month before talks can begin. It comes as Chancellor Philip Hammond calls for financial services to be included in any future trade agreement. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has argued that such a deal had never been done before. But Mr Hammond will say in a speech that the EU has in the past attempted similar agreements, such as in trade talks with the US and Canada. \"If it could be done with Canada or the USA... it could be done with the UK,\" he will say. \"I am clear not only that it is possible to include financial services within a trade deal but that it is very much in our mutual interest to do so.\" Mr Tusk is due to unveil the EU's draft negotiating guidelines for the next round of Brexit talks at a press conference in Luxembourg at about 12:15 GMT. The leaders of the remaining 27 EU states must then approve the plans at a Brussels summit on 22 March, setting the template for Michel Barnier in trade talks that could start as soon as April. Mr Tusk warned last week that Prime Minister Theresa May's plan to leave the single market and customs union made \"frictionless\" trade impossible. The European Parliament has also stressed that its preferred option is for the UK to continue to be a member of the single market and customs union after Brexit, in a draft resolution, leaked to the Politico website. The parliament does not have a formal role in the Brexit negotiations but does have a veto on the final deal. 'Red lines'\nThe European Parliament document, which may be changed before it is adopted later on Wednesday, says non-EU members - even if very closely aligned to the bloc - cannot expect the same rights and benefits as EU members. It also warns that the UK's current \"red lines\" in Brexit talks \"would lead to customs checks and verification which would affect global supply chains and manufacturing processes, even if tariff barriers can be avoided\". It says a \"deep and comprehensive\" trade deal, of the kind envisioned by Theresa May, must entail \"a binding interpretation role\" for the European Court of Justice. The European Parliament resolution also warns the UK against \"cherry-picking of sectors of the internal market\". BBC Brussels Correspondent Adam Fleming said the draft will look like a rejection of the speech Theresa May delivered on Friday setting out her vision of post-Brexit trade, but with some \"wriggle room\" and the possibility of much more if the UK softens some of its red lines. European Parliament Brexit chief Guy Verhofstadt met UK ministers in Downing Street on Tuesday for talks on the rights of EU citizens in the EU, and vice versa, after Brexit. The European Parliament is due to vote on the resolution, the fourth it has issued on Brexit, next week. MPs in Westminster are, meanwhile, set to debate a Plaid Cymru call for UK nationals to be allowed to keep their EU citizenship after Brexit. Plaid said EU citizenship would give holders the right to travel, live, study and work anywhere in the EU even after the UK leaves next year. A UK government spokesman said only citizens of EU member states could hold EU citizenship. ",

Tooting High Street was shut in the early hours, causing rush hour disruption. Police tweeted a picture of the scene, near Tooting Broadway Station, that was strewn with debris as water gushed from a crack in the pavement. It is not known if the burst pipe was damaged in recent severe cold weather. Thames Water said some people in the area may have low water pressure or no water supply because of the flooding. Content is not available It comes after thousands of homes were left without water or suffered from low pressure because of freezing weather over the weekend. Writing to Thames Water, London Mayor Sadiq Khan described the shortage as \"unacceptable\". In a letter to the firm's CEO Steve Robertson, Mr Khan said: \"I am extremely concerned to see the supply issues experienced this weekend with significant numbers of Londoners being left without water for up to four days. \"While I appreciate that the weather conditions played a part in the water outages and increase in leaks I would have expected Thames Water to have foreseen this and had appropriate plans in place. \"It is critical that Thames Water reviews and steps up plans to upgrade and maintain your network. \"I expect generous compensation to be issued to those affected and that this will be clearly and proactively communicated as well as issued quickly.\" Thames Water said its engineers reached the scene in Tooting \"very quickly\" and have stopped the flooding. The A24/Tooting High Street remains closed between Tooting Broadway Station and Hoyle Road while Mitcham Road has reopened. Transport for London said Tooting Broadway Station remained fully open and trains were running as normal. ",

Liam Williams, Steff Evans, Hadleigh Parkes, Gareth Davies and Cory Hill survive from the 37-27 loss in Ireland. Scarlets flanker James Davies will win his first cap in a back row that sees Taulupe Faletau return at number eight to captain the side. Gareth Anscombe is named at fly-half with Northampton Saints' George North selected on the right wing. An all-new front row sees hooker Elliot Dee make his first start alongside Nicky Smith and Tomas Francis, with Bradley Davies joining Hill in the second row. Justin Tipuric is selected at blindside flanker to complete a mobile-looking back row with debutant davies and Lions forward Faletau.

        "content": "A man who insulted a female police officer because of her gender has become the first person to be convicted of sexism in a public space in Belgium. The man, who has not been named, was stopped in June 2016 for violating the highway code and told the officer that her job did not suit women. A court in Brussels fined him \u20ac3,000 (\u00a32,690; $3,725). He can still appeal. The law was introduced in 2014 after an outcry over a documentary showing the abuse women faced on the streets. It condemns any act or statement meant to \"express contempt\", that considers a person inferior due to their gender or reduces someone to a sexual dimension. The court sentenced the man, who was reportedly not in court, over sexism, insults and threats. He can be jailed for a month if he fails to pay the fine in time, Le Soir newspaper reports (in French). \"This is the first time we have used this law to prosecute someone,\" said Gilles Blondeau, a spokesman for the public prosecutor's office. \"It happens frequently that people arrested by the police insult or threaten them. But to personally blame a policewoman because of her sex is something particular.\" The conviction took place in November but only now has been reported by media. Belgium's Institute for the Equality of Women and Men said it hoped that the case would help raise awareness of the law and encourage victims to report cases. \"The educational role of this law is essential to achieve change attitudes and behaviours,\" it said in a statement. Meanwhile, France's government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux has confirmed plans to introduce a new on-the-spot \u20ac90 fine for catcalling and lecherous behaviour in public. The measure is part of a package of laws against sexual violence and harassment to be presented by the government in the coming weeks. ",

On Tuesday, Donald Trump's top economic advisor Gary Cohn, who opposes tariffs, resigned. That was after Mr Trump said EU trade rules make it \"impossible\" for US firms to do business with the bloc. Ms Malmstrom said the US justification for the proposed 25% tariff on steel imports and 10% tariff on aluminium was that US national security is threatened. \"We have serious doubt about that justification. We cannot see how the European Union, friends, and allies in Nato, can be a threat to national security in the US,\" she said. \"We find that assumption deeply unjust.\" She added: \"We have made clear that if a move like this is taken, it will hurt the European Union, it will put thousands of European jobs in jeopardy, and it has to be met by a firm and proportionate response.\" She also said the EU was \"intensively talking\" to US counterparts to try to persuade Washington \"to have a rethink\".

        "content": "Amidst all the talk about Brexit - about borders and about trade - ministers have said almost nothing about how immigration will be controlled after the UK leaves the EU. They have not yet come up with the answer to a fundamental question - who should we let in? The promise to take back control of our borders was the headline of the leave campaign. Yet almost two years on, there has been little public debate about how that will be done, or what our immigration system should look like once free movement of EU citizens in and out of Britain has ended. The Home Office originally promised to publish its plans for a new immigration policy before Christmas. Then it said the spring. Now ministers say it'll be in the autumn. Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes told me: \"There isn't any dithering. What I'm committed to doing is making evidence-based policy. And so we will bring an immigration policy forward when we're ready.\" They were, she said, waiting for the expert advice from the Migration Advisory Committee, an independent public body which advises the government on migration issues. Why the delay? Very likely it's because they're caught in the middle, between the demands of British business and the expectations of many of the voters who backed Brexit. Pressure is now mounting on Theresa May from a growing number of businesses who fear that they will not be able to find the workers they need after we leave the EU. First, the figures: Net migration overall - the difference between the number of people coming to the UK and leaving - is 244,000 a year, more than double the government's target. But net migration from the EU fell sharply to 90,000 - the lowest for 5 years. And from food manufacturers to delivery firms to fast food restaurants, I've been hearing the fears of Britain's bosses about what happens if they can't get the workers they need. Who will drive the lorries?\nThat's the question worrying Leigh Pomlett, president of the Freight Transport Association. More than one in seven of the HGV drivers based in Britain - that's 40,000 drivers - are EU nationals. Speaking to me at his company CEVA's Tamworth warehouse, he told me he is beginning to see people going back home, as the wages people can send back become worth less due to the fall in the pound, and because more jobs are now available in Europe. \"Polish people are wanted back in Poland more than ever. They're also wanted in Germany, more than ever. So there is a global labour market which is more mobile than it ever was. Will they move? Yes they will.\" He says the industry could do with another 50,000 drivers, but he can't see where they are going to come from. And what's bad for his business could be bad for yours, as he warns that the days of free next-day delivery could come to an end. Who'll produce the food we eat?\nThat's what Patrick Hook wants to know. His family farming business PD Hook hatches eggs on an industrial scale - more than nine million per week. EU workers represent 33% of all people employed in the food manufacturing sector. Patrick is worried. Some of the people he employs from the EU have already headed home. Others are thinking about it. \"The labour crisis - and not having those skilled permanent people available to us from the European Union - is a bigger threat to us as a business and our industry than avian influenza, that is a fact.\" Who'll serve our food and drink?\nOrder a coffee, a sandwich or a salad in a fast food restaurant, and you're very likely to have it served up by a European - one of half a million EU nationals working in shops, hotels, restaurants and fast food outlets. More than half the staff at Leon - an upmarket fast food chain - are from the EU. John Vincent, Leon's chief executive and co-founder, warns that if the industry can't recruit enough staff, then restaurant chains will become increasingly automated, with machines preparing dishes, and companies using apps and vending machines to sell and deliver them to customers. \"There's a danger if we can't recruit people - and we've already seen it in America - that people will be replaced by robots, and that's not something we want to see. \"So, that's not 'Mad Max fantasy world', it's already happening.\" Jacob Rees Mogg, the leading Brexiteer backbencher, accepts that jobs of the future may be taken by robots instead of Brits. \"I think that if you look at check-outs in supermarkets, that is an efficiency for the supermarket. It reduces the cost, and it may be quicker for the consumer as well. I don't think we should be frightened of mechanisation. Those jobs will go to robots whether we have immigration or not.\" He is urging ministers not to give in to the pressure. \"Of course business wants to carry on what it's been doing, because it's easy, but the responsibility of government is to look after the consumer and the citizen.\" What do voters want?\nThe voters of Mansfield in Nottinghamshire are watching to see if the Tories deliver on their promise to cut annual net migration to the tens of thousands. This ex-mining town and traditional Labour constituency elected a Tory MP for the first time in its history last year. More than 70% of people here voted to leave the EU. Immigration, I was told, was a factor. It was certainly an issue for local resident Jeffrey Smith: \"I'll walk down every morning to this coffee bar, and - not being racist - I can probably meet or pass 15 people, and sometimes you don't hear an English voice. and then you think 'what on earth's wrong with Mansfield?' \"There's too many people from other countries living here and living off us.\" Richard Vickerstaff runs a local shop called the Vinyl Lounge. He didn't vote for Brexit, but says he knows why people are worried about immigration. \"I think Mansfield probably historically isn't used to a lot of immigration, you know, on that side. So to have quite a heavy influx of people suddenly coming quite quickly within two or three years, people notice that, and certain people obviously feel uncomfortable about it.\" Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes told me the government was sticking to its long-term target of bringing net immigration down. \"The last two sets of statistics that we've seen have seen the direction of travel downwards, which is what we're aiming towards. But none of us have ever said that this going to be either easy or quick.\" But the Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott told me that the government's target was \"completely bogus\". She says, \"it's just a way of the Tories talking an anti-immigrant narrative\". When asked twice whether immigration could go up under Labour, she did not rule it out. \"We can't say what is going to happen to levels of migration, because migration flows are subject to all sorts of international pressures. With increased emphasis on training and skills, the need for people's specific skills from overseas may well decline.\" It all adds up to a pretty painful position for Theresa May - caught between those competing pressures. Control, what control?\nAs well as a debate about what level immigration should be, there's the question of how the new system of rules are designed. It is thought the Cabinet has had only one high-level discussion about immigration recently, and it is said to have argued about whether preference should in future be given to workers from the EU - Poles, Spanish and French - or whether there should be a level playing field for immigrants wherever they come from. Brexiteers like Jacob Rees Mogg back the latter approach. \"I can see no reason to give preference to people from the EU after we've left. Why should we discriminate against our Commonwealth friends, against our American friends, the very large Indian population in this country? Surely we should prioritise members of their family against people from the EU with whom we have no connection?\" But this is one more subject that looks set to get included in those endless complex Brexit negotiations. The more trade we want, the more open our borders may have to be. One well-placed source told me that the first thing countries want to export is their people. That, incidentally, applies to India or China as well. so any new post-Brexit trade deal with them may involve hard bargaining about liberalising the immigration rules for their people who want to come here. Some argue that different parts of the country need a different approach. SNP First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Scotland needs more immigrants, not a target to have fewer: \"It's damaging and counter-productive. It runs counter to the needs of the Scottish economy. \"Our pensioner population over the next 25 years is projected to increase by 25%, and yet our working-age population - those who are in employment and contributing the taxes to support everything else that we hold dear - is only going to increase by 1%. So that tells a story that we need to be able to attract talent from elsewhere.\" The truth is the debate on immigration has scarcely begun. Most voters want to see what they call control. They want to see the numbers cut. They like the idea of people being be able to come here to do vital jobs and of blocking those with no or few skills. That, though, doesn't go very far to answer the question \"who should we let in?\" Nick Robinson's Panorama Immigration: Who should we let in? will be broadcast on BBC One on Wednesday 7 March at 19:30. Or watch it afterwards via the BBC iPlayer. ",

        "content": "South Korean envoys will bring a private message to the US from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un when they meet in Washington later this week, according to reports. They were given the undisclosed message on Monday when meeting Mr Kim in rare talks in Pyongyang, local media say. It is not clear whether the envoys will meet US President Donald Trump. Previous US talks with North Korea have come to nothing and there has been no comment from Pyongyang itself. It has also been agreed that the leaders of the two Koreas' leaders will meet at a summit in April for the first time in more than a decade, and the first since Mr Kim took power. South Korea's head of national security Chung Eui-yong and intelligence agency chief Sun Hoon met North Korea's reclusive leader during a two-day trip that ended on Tuesday. Mr Kim clearly expressed his country's willingness to talk with Washington and to pause weapons testing while this happens, Mr Chung told reporters on Tuesday. \"We cannot reveal everything to the media but we do have additional views of North Korea we will relay to the United States when we visit the US,\" he said, according to South Korean news agency Yonhap. Donald Trump responded cautiously to news that North Korea is willing to talk about giving up its nuclear weapons. What's the secret message?\nSouth Korean officials have been vague and careful with their diplomatic language following their first ever meeting with Mr Kim. It is not clear if they are embellishing the message's significance, or who the private message is addressed to. The US state department said on Tuesday it is in touch with the White House about a proposed meeting with the South Korean envoys, Reuters reported. It appears both Koreas are trying to capitalise on eased tensions after the 2018 Seoul Winter Olympics, which saw them march together under one flag. How did we get here?\nMr Trump said the recent rhetoric coming out of North and South Korea was \"very positive\" in the wake of the two nations' rare meeting. The North's KCNA news agency reported Mr Kim had \"warmly welcomed\" the delegates on Monday. The next day, South Korean officials said their neighbours were willing to discuss giving up nuclear weapons if the regime's safety was assured. The US president said he believed Pyongyang's offer to hold denuclearisation talks was \"sincere\", but also said it was \"because of the sanctions and what we're doing with respect to North Korea.\" Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction! End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump The US slapped fresh sanctions on the communist nation this week following its conclusion that Mr Kim's half-brother was killed by a chemical attack in Malaysia on the orders of the North Korean government. The US has consistently accused North Korea of being behind the attack on Kim Jong-nam. North Korea however denies any involvement. Why is North Korea acting now?\nIt is difficult to be certain. Since the South made the announcement, there has been no comment from North Korea. Some US and South Korean officials have said that Pyongyang may simply be trying to buy time to develop weapons programmes. There have also been suggestions that Mr Kim is trying to soften the impact of biting sanctions on the impoverished country, seeking food and other aid from overseas. Another factor may be growing diplomatic pressure from North Korea's neighbours, particularly from China - the regional superpower and Pyongyang's only real ally. What has gone wrong with other talks in the past?\nA series of six-party talks have been held since North Korea decided to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 2003. But attempts to negotiate aid-for-disarmament deals have repeatedly failed. In 2009, North Korea pulled out of the talks and expelled all nuclear inspectors from the country, in response to UN Security Council criticism of a rocket launch. Pyongyang also vowed to resume its nuclear activities. A number of bids to restart the talks collapsed, including in 2012 when North Korea launched another rocket, two weeks after announcing a \"leap day\" agreement with the US. The North said it was commemorating the birth of its founding father with a new satellite, but the launch was condemned by others as a provocative test of missile technology. Throughout 2017 Mr Kim ordered a series of incendiary ballistic missile tests, significantly raising the stakes. In response the UN implemented increasingly tough sanctions. ",

        "content": "The EU has condemned US plans for tough tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, saying they jeopardise European jobs. EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom set out plans to retaliate against the proposed US tariffs. These include higher import duties on bourbon, peanut butter, cranberries, orange juice, steel, and industrial products, she said. On Tuesday, Donald Trump's top economic advisor Gary Cohn, who opposes tariffs, resigned. That was after Mr Trump said EU trade rules make it \"impossible\" for US firms to do business with the bloc. Ms Malmstrom said the US justification for the proposed 25% tariff on steel imports and 10% tariff on aluminium was that US national security is threatened. \"We have serious doubt about that justification. We cannot see how the European Union, friends, and allies in Nato, can be a threat to national security in the US,\" she said. \"We find that assumption deeply unjust.\" She added: \"We have made clear that if a move like this is taken, it will hurt the European Union, it will put thousands of European jobs in jeopardy, and it has to be met by a firm and proportionate response.\" She also said the EU was \"intensively talking\" to US counterparts to try to persuade Washington \"to have a rethink\".

        "content": "Using \"dog-speak\" is important in building a bond between a dog and their owner, scientists from the University of York have found. During a series of tests, dogs were spoken to in a high-pitched voice and again in a normal adult voice. Researchers then monitored which speaker the dogs responded to and wanted to interact with. PhD student Alex Benjamin said it seemed dogs were more likely to favour the speaker that used a high pitch. Baby talk\nThe researchers wanted to test whether speaking to dogs in \"dog-directed\" speech was useful to the animals, or whether humans did this simply because they view pets in the same way as babies. \"Dog-directed\" speech involves speaking in a high-pitched voice with exaggerated emotion - in a similar way that adults often talk to small children. Dr Katie Slocombe from the university's department of psychology explains: \"This high-pitched rhythmic speech is common in human interactions with dogs in western cultures, but there isn't a great deal known about whether it benefits a dog. \"We wanted to see whether social bonding between animals and humans was influenced by the type and content of the communication.\" Who's a good boy then?\nDuring the tests, phrases such as \"you're a good dog!\" and \"shall we go for a walk?\", were used. Next, another person would talk to the animal in a normal voice about non-dog-related content, for example \"I went to the cinema last night.\" The speakers then mixed \"dog-directed\" speech with non-dog-related words, and normal speech with dog-related words. Researchers measured both the attentiveness of the dog while the speaker was talking, and whom the dog wanted to interact with once the speaker had finished. The scientists found dogs were more likely to want to spend time with the speaker who had used both \"dog-directed\" speech and dog-related content. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning When the different types of speech were mixed up dogs did not show a preference for either speaker. It led student Alex Benjamin to conclude: \"This suggests that adult dogs need to hear dog-relevant words spoken in a high-pitched emotional voice in order to find it relevant.\" ",

        "content": "US President Donald Trump's top economic adviser Gary Cohn is resigning, the White House has said. It is the latest in a series of high-profile departures from President Trump's team. There has been speculation that Mr Cohn, a supporter of free trade, was angered by Mr Trump's plans to impose tariffs on aluminium and steel imports. In a statement released by the White House, Mr Cohn said it had been \"an honour to serve my country\". The 57-year-old former president of the Goldman Sachs bank had helped Mr Trump push through his sweeping tax reforms late last year. Why has Mr Cohn gone?\nGary Cohn and President Trump were never believed to be close. Mr Cohn wasn't specific about the reasons, saying in a statement it had been \"an honour to serve my country and enact pro-growth economic policies to benefit the American people, in particular the passage of historic tax reform\". Once that mission had been achieved, a number of differences may have prompted the departure, including the possible looming trade tariff war and his differences on that issue with trade adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Mr Cohn had reportedly set up a meeting between Mr Trump and business executives who opposed the tariffs move. But Mr Trump pulled out of that meeting and on Tuesday reportedly asked Mr Cohn in the Oval Office to back the tariffs publicly. Mr Cohn did not answer, sources told Bloomberg. In August last year, Mr Cohn had also criticised Mr Trump over his reaction to a far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, saying the administration \"can and must do better\". He was reported to have drafted a resignation letter after the event. What has the White House said?\nAn official said: \"For several weeks Gary had been discussing with the president that it was nearing time for him to transition out.\" The exact departure date had yet to be determined. The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House. Wrong! People will always come & go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos, only great Energy! End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump In a statement, Mr Trump said: \"Gary... did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping to deliver historic tax cuts and reforms and unleashing the American economy once again. \"He is a rare talent and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people.\" And the markets?\nAnalysts were pointing to the resignation of Mr Cohn, a free market advocate, as one reason behind a drop in shares across Asia on Wednesday. The Nikkei closed 0.77% down and the Hang Seng 1.03%. Rick Meckler of LibertyView Capital Management told Reuters that Mr Cohn was \"very credible\" and the resignation announcement \"certainly causes short-term downward pressure\". The dollar continued its retreat against the yen, down from 113 at the start of the year to 105.6 on Wednesday. European stocks also opened lower, the FTSE 100 and pan-Europe STOXX 600 falling about 0.5% after opening. Does this herald a new direction?\nAnalysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Gary Cohn was a bit of a stranger in a strange land. He was a Democrat in a Republican White House; an economic globalist working for a president who campaigned on economic nationalism. Now, it seems, Donald Trump's protectionist bent has pushed the top administration economic adviser to the exit. This was not an unexpected development. By many accounts, there had been a contentious White House fight over whether to impose sweeping sanctions on US steel and aluminium imports - a tug-of-war that was settled, precipitously, by the president himself last week. There were the rumours that Mr Cohn was only sticking around to see last year's tax bill over the finish line, after his extreme discomfort following the president's warm words about some of the white nationalist marchers involved in violent clashes in Charlottesville last August. Mr Cohn was reportedly viewed by many Trump loyalists in the White House as an unwelcome interloper. Some on the outside, particularly in the financial world, welcomed him as a moderating influence - along with son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka. Now the former is leaving and the latter two seem greatly weakened. All this could mark a sharp new direction in White House policy. What's the trade tariff dispute about?\nLast week, Mr Trump announced he would be imposing steep tariffs on steel and aluminium imports - 25% and 10% respectively. He is yet to sign them into effect. He has regularly argued that other countries have been \"taking advantage of\" the US on trade for decades. Trading partners reacted angrily. The EU, which says the steel and aluminium tariffs could cost it \u20ac2.8bn ($3.48bn; \u00a32.5bn) a year, has now drawn up a $3.5bn hit list of retaliatory tariffs. These include higher import duties on bourbon, peanut butter, cranberries, orange juice, steel and industrial products, EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said. There are now fears of a global trade war. Mr Trump said on Tuesday: \"When we're behind on every single country, trade wars aren't so bad.\" But there is disquiet at his proposals even among members of Mr Trump's Republican party. House Speaker Paul Ryan was one of those urging Mr Trump to have a \"smarter\" plan that was \"more surgical and more targeted\" and avoided the \"unintended consequences\" of a trade war. Who will replace Mr Cohn?\nMr Trump tweeted that he would pick Mr Cohn's replacement \"soon\". \"Many people wanting the job - will choose wisely!\" he added. Possible candidates mooted by US media include Peter Navarro and Larry Kudlow, a conservative commentator and 2016 campaign adviser. President Trump tweeted that there was no chaos at the White House but there were \"still... some people that I want to change\". 'Sensible adult' leaves: US media on Cohn's departure\nA piece in Bloomberg carries the concerns of Wall St operators that the White House is losing experienced financial experts. Kathy Wylde, who runs the Partnership for New York City, says: \"Gary was one that we counted on.\" A Washington Post article headlined \"Gary Cohn didn't get much done. But it could be worse - and it probably will\" says the adviser was an \"odd duck\" but that it is hard to fault him, given \"the Trump administration has been too understaffed and unfocused to get much done\". An editorial in the New York Times says Gary Cohn was \"supposed to be among the sensible adults in the room. Now, he is leaving after failing repeatedly to be the stabilising influence that the Trump administration sorely needed\". Bill Powell in Newsweek says there are two things Donald Trump really likes - a rising stock market and tariffs. But one thing the resignation of Gary Cohn makes abundantly clear, he says, is that \"you can't have both... the world just doesn't work that way\". ",

        "content": "Italian footballer Mario Balotelli has attacked the country's first black senator in an online post. Toni Iwobi was elected on Sunday for the anti-immigration Lega party. \"Maybe I'm blind or perhaps they have not told him yet that he is black. But shame!!!\" the footballer posted on Instagram. Born in northern Nigeria, Mr Iwobi came to Italy in 1976 and became a councillor for Lega (the League) in the Lombardy city of Spirano in 1995. What did Balotelli's post say?\nThe Italy striker, who plays for French Ligue 1 side Nice, put his post on Instagram on Tuesday. Accompanying the text was a photo of Mr Iwobi and League leader Matteo Salvini, both raising clenched fists and wearing T-shirts saying \"Stop Invasion\" at an anti-immigration rally. While there have been black members of Italy's lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, the 62-year-old Toni Iwobi is the first black senator. In a Facebook post celebrating his election, Mr Iwobi thanked Mr Salvini, who he called \"a great leader\". Amici, \u00e8 con grande emozione che vi comunico che sono stato eletto Senatore della Repubblica! Dopo oltre 25 anni di... End of Facebook post by Toni Last month, Mario Balotelli was booked by a referee for pointing out racist chants made during his side's 3-2 loss to Dijon. Anti-discriminatory body Fare said the striker should get \"added protection\" from referees for highlighting such abuse. What happened in Italy's election?\nNo one party gained a majority, but the results show a major shift away from traditional parties. The Eurosceptic, populist Five Star Movement was the biggest single party, with about a third of the vote. Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio announced that his party was open to coalition talks - despite ruling this out in the run-up to the vote. However, the right-wing coalition, mainly comprised of the League and former PM Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia but also including the Brothers of Italy, is also vying for power. Mr Salvini said on Monday his party had the \"right to govern\" and that although he did not want a broad \"minestrone\" coalition government, he would speak to other parties to form a parliamentary majority. On Wednesday, former PM Silvio Berlusconi said he would \"loyally support\" Mr Salvini's efforts to form a government. His right-wing Forza Italia won 14% of the vote, so was relegated to the second-largest party in its coalition with the League, which won 17.4%. What does the election result mean?\nThe surge of support for populist parties has been compared with the Brexit vote in the UK and the election of Donald Trump in the US. Five Star was founded in 2009 by comedian Beppe Grillo, who denounced cronyism in Italian politics. It has captured new voters in the poorer regions of southern Italy, feeding off anger over institutional corruption, economic hardship and immigration. Italian voters appear to have abandoned the Democratic Party, led by Matteo Renzi until he quit on Monday, because of dissatisfaction over these issues, and the centre-left coalition is set for a distant third. With more than 600,000 people making the sea journey from Libya to Italy since 2013, immigration was a key issue. But the state of the economy was also at the centre of the debate. In 2016, some 18 million people were at risk of poverty, and unemployment is currently at 11%. Results from the vote for Italy's Senate also favoured populists and parties of the right. Five Star performed better than anticipated and was set to take the most seats but miss out on a majority. ",

EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom set out plans to retaliate against the proposed US tariffs. These include higher import duties on bourbon, peanut butter, cranberries, orange juice, steel, and industrial products, she said. On Tuesday, Donald Trump's top economic advisor Gary Cohn, who opposes tariffs, resigned. That was after Mr Trump said EU trade rules make it \"impossible\" for US firms to do business with the bloc. Ms Malmstrom said the US justification for the proposed 25% tariff on steel imports and 10% tariff on aluminium was that US national security is threatened. \"We have serious doubt about that justification. We cannot see how the European Union, friends, and allies in Nato, can be a threat to national security in the US,\" she said. \"We find that assumption deeply unjust.\" She added: \"We have made clear that if a move like this is taken, it will hurt the European Union, it will put thousands of European jobs in jeopardy, and it has to be met by a firm and proportionate response.\" She also said the EU was \"intensively talking\" to US counterparts to try to persuade Washington \"to have a rethink\".

        "content": "Draft EU guidelines on the EU's approach to the next phase of Brexit talks on future relations with the UK have been revealed. They repeat EU warnings about \"cherry-picking\" and say leaving the customs union and single market \"will have negative economic consequences\". But it also suggests that the EU is ready to change its stance if the UK position \"evolves\". The document must be signed off by EU leaders before trade talks can start. EU Council President Donald Tusk unveiled the documents at a press conference in Luxembourg. The leaders of the remaining 27 EU states must then approve the plans at a Brussels summit on 22 March, setting the template for chief negotiator Michel Barnier for talks about the future UK-EU relationship. The UK is due to leave the EU at the end of March 2019, and both sides say a deal on their future relationship needs to be agreed by this autumn to allow time for parliaments to approve the deal before Brexit happens. The draft guidelines say there will be no UK membership of EU agencies or bodies after Brexit and existing fishing rights for EU vessels in UK waters will continue. And the document says there must be limits on how deep a free trade agreement on services should be and it should include \"ambitious\" provisions on free movement of people. The document says the \"four freedoms\" of the single market - the free flow of goods, services, money and people - are \"indivisible\" and \"there can be no \"cherry picking\" through participation based on a sector-by-sector approach, that would undermine the integrity and proper functioning of the single market\". But the European Council \"confirms its readiness to initiate work towards a free trade agreement (FTA), to be finalised and concluded once the UK is no longer a member state\". It adds: \"Such an agreement cannot offer the same benefits as membership and cannot amount to participation in the single market or parts thereof.\" It comes as Chancellor Philip Hammond calls for financial services to be included in any future trade agreement. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has argued that such a deal had never been done before. But Mr Hammond will say in a speech that the EU has in the past attempted similar agreements, such as in trade talks with the US and Canada. \"If it could be done with Canada or the USA... it could be done with the UK,\" he will say. \"I am clear not only that it is possible to include financial services within a trade deal but that it is very much in our mutual interest to do so.\" The EU draft guidelines contain no mention of financial services. The BBC's Economics Editor Kamal Ahmed said the two sides appeared far apart but most people involved in the talks thought a deal was possible. The European Parliament has stressed that its preferred option is for the UK to continue to be a member of the single market and customs union after Brexit, in a draft resolution, leaked to the Politico website. The parliament does not have a formal role in the Brexit negotiations but does have a veto on the final deal. The European Parliament document, which may be changed before it is adopted later on Wednesday, says non-EU members - even if very closely aligned to the bloc - cannot expect the same rights and benefits as EU members. It also warns that the UK's current \"red lines\" in Brexit talks \"would lead to customs checks and verification which would affect global supply chains and manufacturing processes, even if tariff barriers can be avoided\". It says a \"deep and comprehensive\" trade deal, of the kind envisioned by Theresa May, must entail \"a binding interpretation role\" for the European Court of Justice. The European Parliament resolution also warns the UK against \"cherry-picking of sectors of the internal market\". BBC Brussels Correspondent Adam Fleming said the draft will look like a rejection of the speech Theresa May delivered on Friday setting out her vision of post-Brexit trade, but with some \"wriggle room\" and the possibility of much more if the UK softens some of its red lines. European Parliament Brexit chief Guy Verhofstadt met UK ministers in Downing Street on Tuesday for talks on the rights of EU citizens in the EU, and vice versa, after Brexit. The European Parliament is due to vote on the resolution, the fourth it has issued on Brexit, next week. MPs in Westminster are, meanwhile, set to debate a Plaid Cymru call for UK nationals to be allowed to keep their EU citizenship after Brexit. Plaid said EU citizenship would give holders the right to travel, live, study and work anywhere in the EU even after the UK leaves next year. A UK government spokesman said only citizens of EU member states could hold EU citizenship. ",

        "content": "Using \"dog-speak\" is important in building a bond between a dog and their owner, scientists from the University of York have found. During a series of tests, dogs were spoken to in a high-pitched voice and again in a normal adult voice. Researchers then monitored which speaker the dogs responded to and wanted to interact with. PhD student Alex Benjamin said it seemed dogs were more likely to favour the speaker that used a high pitch. Baby talk\nThe researchers wanted to test whether speaking to dogs in \"dog-directed\" speech was useful to the animals, or whether humans did this simply because they view pets in the same way as babies. \"Dog-directed\" speech involves speaking in a high-pitched voice with exaggerated emotion - in a similar way that adults often talk to small children. Dr Katie Slocombe from the university's department of psychology explains: \"This high-pitched rhythmic speech is common in human interactions with dogs in western cultures, but there isn't a great deal known about whether it benefits a dog. \"We wanted to see whether social bonding between animals and humans was influenced by the type and content of the communication.\" Who's a good boy then?\nDuring the tests, phrases such as \"you're a good dog!\" and \"shall we go for a walk?\", were used. Next, another person would talk to the animal in a normal voice about non-dog-related content, for example \"I went to the cinema last night.\" The speakers then mixed \"dog-directed\" speech with non-dog-related words, and normal speech with dog-related words. Researchers measured both the attentiveness of the dog while the speaker was talking, and whom the dog wanted to interact with once the speaker had finished. The scientists found dogs were more likely to want to spend time with the speaker who had used both \"dog-directed\" speech and dog-related content. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning When the different types of speech were mixed up dogs did not show a preference for either speaker. It led student Alex Benjamin to conclude: \"This suggests that adult dogs need to hear dog-relevant words spoken in a high-pitched emotional voice in order to find it relevant.\" The researchers could start looking into whether puppies demonstrate similar preferences, however there are no plans to carry out the same tests with cats.

        "content": "More is known about the substance used in the suspected poisoning of a former Russian double agent and his daughter, the home secretary has said. Speaking after chairing a meeting of the government's emergency committee Cobra, Amber Rudd said the police would be sharing details later on Wednesday. Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found unconscious in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon and remain critically ill. Police want to speak to anyone who was in the city centre around that time. They are particularly keen to speak to people who ate at Zizzi restaurant or drank in The Bishop's Mill pub. Mr Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter were found slumped on a bench outside the Maltings shopping centre. Scientists at the UK's military research facility at Porton Down have been examining a substance thought to be behind their collapse. Mrs Rudd said: \"We need to keep a cool head and collect all the evidence we can. \"We need to make sure that we respond not to rumour but to all the evidence they collect and then we will have to decide what action to take.\" She said the police investigation was likely to be lengthy and it was important to make sure they had the space to continue their investigation. Earlier, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, head of Counter Terrorism Policing, appealed for witnesses, saying: \"Did you see anything out of the ordinary? It may be that at the time, nothing appeared out of place or untoward but with what you now know, you remember something that might be of significance... \"The weather was poor that day so there were not as many people out and about. Every statement we can take is important.\" Cordons have been erected around Salisbury, with another now in place near Solstice Park, a business park in Amesbury, a town about 10 miles away. This is linked to the investigation and is a precautionary measure, the police said. Two police officers caught up in the suspected contamination were treated in hospital for minor symptoms - believed to be itchy eyes and wheezing - before they were given the all clear. A third member of the emergency services remains in hospital. Relatives of Col Skripal, who was convicted in Russia in 2006 of spying for Britain, have told the BBC Russian Service that he believed the country's special services might come after him at any time. It has been said his only friends in the UK are in the British intelligence services, but he has also joined his local railway club and given lectures at military academies. His wife, elder brother and son have all died in recent years. Ms Skripal lives in Moscow and has visited her father in the UK regularly, especially during the past two years. Family and friends say she did move to the UK but missed Russia so returned to Moscow where she has worked for multinationals, including Nike and PepsiCo. It is thought her latest visit to the UK may have been timed to coincide with her late brother's birthday. Alexander Skripal died aged 43 last July in St Petersburg from liver failure in what relatives believe to have been suspicious circumstances. He is buried in Salisbury close to his mother, Liudmila Skripal, who died from cancer in 2012. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning The possibility of an unexplained substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko - a public inquiry concluded the killing of the Russian dissident had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Former MI5 officer Annie Machon pointed out that the two cases were very different, however. Mr Litvinenko was a whistleblower, a dissident and a consultant for MI6 actively at the time of his death, she said, whereas Mr Skripal has already been caught, convicted and pardoned and allowed to freely find safe haven in the UK. \"There's no conceivable reason that I can see that the Russian state would have been targeting him at the moment,\" she told BBC's Breakfast. \"That's why we need to think about what else he might have been involved in.\" On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the case. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, and says it is open to co-operating with British police if requested. The Russian embassy in London accused the media of creating \"an impression of a planned operation by the Russian special services, which is completely untrue\". Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Col Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years. Do you have any information to share on this story?

        "content": "The Mississippi state Senate has passed a bill that would ban abortions after 15 weeks - a move that would give it the strictest limits in the US. The Gestational Age Act still has to go back to the House for second approval. If it passes, Governor Phil Bryant has said he will sign the measure into law, adding that he wants Mississippi to be \"the safest place in America for an unborn child.\" Similar moves in other states have been blocked by legal challenges. Currently, Mississippi prohibits abortions from 20 weeks, unless her life is in danger or in cases of fatal foetal abnormality. The new proposal would move that forward five weeks, and makes no allowances for rape or incest for later terminations. It has already passed in the state House of Representatives, but has to return for secondary approval before being approved by Governor Bryant. As I have repeatedly said, I want Mississippi to be the safest place in America for an unborn child. House Bill 1510 will help us achieve that goal. https://t.co/ffqRfhwx51 End of Twitter post by @PhilBryantMS Diane Derzis, who runs the only abortion clinic in the state, has said that she believes the bill is unconstitutional. She has said the clinic would consider a legal challenge if the bill is signed into law. In 2014 federal judges ruled that attempts for six- and 12-week bans in North Dakota and Arkansas were unconstitutional, and struck them down. \"These groups are tossing anything and everything out there, anything that could start winding its way through the legal system because we're in a very fragile place right now,\" Ms Derzis told local newspaper the Clarion Ledger. \"Roe is clearly in danger and that's what they're preparing for,\" she said, referring to the landmark 1973 Supreme Court case, in which judges decided women had the right to abortions. \"They hope by the time they get to the Supreme Court they will have changed the Supreme Court.\" President Trump has supported a proposed federal ban on abortions after 20 weeks after fertilisation, but the bill was blocked in the Senate in January.

        "content": "A bomb planted on a London Underground train in September last year was designed to cause \"maximum harm and carnage\", a court has heard. Commuters fled in \"fear and panic\" when the train was engulfed by a \"large fireball\" at Parsons Green, a jury was told. Ahmed Hassan, 18, is accused of planting a bomb on the District Line carriage on September 15, 2017. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. Thirty people were injured in the incident, the Old Bailey was told. 'Fear and panic'\nProsecutor Alison Morgan told the jurors that Mr Hassan, an Iraqi asylum seeker, packed a bomb with screwdrivers, knives and nails to cause \"maximum carnage\" on the rush hour Tube. She said: \"There were approximately 93 people in the carriage when the device detonated. \"The partial explosion created a large fireball. Some in the carriage were caught by the flames and sustained significant burns. \"Many ran in fear and panic. They were fortunate . Had the device fully detonated, it is inevitable that serious injury and significant damage would have been caused within the carriage.\" The jury was shown CCTV pictures from inside the train showing a fireball engulfing the carriage as people ducked from the flames. The court heard that hundreds of people tried to get down the narrow staircase and out of the station following the explosion. But Mr Hassan had got off the carriage at Putney Bridge Station before the bomb went off. He was arrested at the Port of Dover the next day. Ms Morgan said the device was made from the volatile chemical explosive TATP and contained 2.2kg of sockets, screws, bolts, nails, knives and screwdrivers. Asylum seeker\nJurors were told that Mr Hassan arrived in Britain in the back of a lorry via the Channel Tunnel in October 2015. He told authorities he was born in June 1999 in Iraq, but had no identity documents. Mr Hassan claimed asylum, and from 2016 lived with foster parents in Cavendish Road, Sunbury in Surrey. At the time he allegedly planned his attack, his asylum claim was still outstanding, the court heard. ",

        "content": "While many families in the UK are gearing up for Mother's Day on Sunday, a nursery school in Belgium has announced that it will no longer be celebrating it. Children at Catteau-Aurore school in Brussels will instead have one 'family day' where they will be encouraged to make gifts to take home to their whole family. But not everyone is happy with the change. The letter sent to parents this week said the decision was taken to better represent the many forms modern families take. \"Family themes will be discussed in class, but with lots of space given to children to express their own diverse situations,\" it said. \"From now on, whether they have one mother, a mother and a stepmother, two fathers, or a grandmother\u2026 what is shared by everyone is the fact that they live with adults who they love and who love them.\" 'Adapting to society'\nCatteau-Aurore school has caused controversy in Belgium with the move, which will also affect Father's Day in June. Mother's Day in Belgium is marked in May. But head teacher Nadine Joannes told the BBC that the decision had been motivated by complaints that some children had felt left out during past celebrations. \"Society changes and we are adapting to society,\" she said. \"Seeing just one child suffer is motivation to make a change for all children. One unhappy child, it's already one too many.\" What is Mother's Day?\nRead more: Families living nearby had mixed feelings about the school's decision. \"I think people exaggerate a bit with wanting to change everything,\" local mother Julie said. \"It doesn't need to go the extreme way. Even if there are two fathers or two mothers, which I have nothing against, I still feel we can acknowledge mothers.\" Miriam, another young mother living nearby, agreed: \"Personally, I celebrated it as a child and it was fun. \"I understand about new families but we should keep celebrating mothers. It's good to have new ways of thinking but I think it's a shame to stop a nice tradition.\" You may also like:\nCatteau-Aurore's decision follows a similar move at another primary school in Brussels last year. Staff at Singelijn school described the experience as difficult and said they wanted to have the controversy behind them. Catteau-Aurore's head teacher admitted there had been negative reactions from some parents, but some strong encouragement too. Jacqueline, a great-grandmother who has seen her fair share of Mother's Days, said she did not mind if it was replaced by a family day at school - Mother's Day could still be celebrated at home if families wished. \"It's nice to have a day for you, but all mothers want is a flower at home anyway,\" she said.

        "content": "Chancellor Philip Hammond will tell European leaders that it is in the \"mutual interest\" of both the UK and the EU to include financial services in a free trade agreement. In a speech, Mr Hammond will set out his argument against \"sceptics\", saying it is possible to reach a deal. But EU president Donald Tusk flat out rejected the UK proposals. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has argued that such a deal had never been done before. But Mr Hammond will say the EU has in the past attempted similar agreements. In December, Mr Barnier said: \"There is not a single trade agreement that is open to financial services. It doesn't exist.\" Mr Hammond will say on Wednesday that the EU itself tried to include financial services on trade deals with the US and Canada. He will say: \"If it could be done with Canada or the USA ... it could be done with the UK.\" The Chancellor will stress: \"I am clear not only that it ispossible to include financial services within a trade deal but that it is very much in our mutual interest to do so.\" However, European Union president Donald Tusk issued guidelines telling EU negotiators that the UK will have to settle for a more conventional free trade agreement, such as the EU's deal with Canada. The UK's stance on leaving the single market means the City having to settle for more limited access to European markets, he said. \"There's no possibility to have some form of exclusive form single market for some parts of our economies,\" he said. \"I fully understand and of course I respect Theresa May's [political] objective - to demonstrate at any price that Brexit could be a success and was the right choice. \"But sorry, that is not our objective,\" Mr Tusk added. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier says a trade deal including financial services \"does not exist\". On Tuesday, French economy minister Bruno Le Maire told the BBC: \"Financial services cannot be in a free trade agreement, for many reasons, for reasons of stability, for the sake of supervision because there are some very specific rules for financial services.\" He said that the \"best solution\", would be for a system of \"equivalence\" where both sides recognised each other's standards. But Mr Hammond will say: \"It is time to address the sceptics who say a trade deal including financial services cannot be done because it has never been done before. \"To them I say 'every trade deal the EU has ever done has been unique'. \"The EU has never negotiated the same arrangement twice. It has bespoke relationships with Turkey, Canada, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland.\" Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, economics editor\nIn his speech on UK-EU co-operation post-Brexit, the Chancellor will refer to past attempts at forging a free trade agreement between the US and Europe. \"The EU itself pursued ambitious financial services co-operation in its proposals for TTIP [the now aborted Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership],\" Mr Hammond will say. \"Which it described as a partnership that would be: 'more than a traditional free trade agreement'.\" Mr Hammond is arguing that if the EU tried it before with a nation which doesn't have regulatory alignment on financial services - America - then surely it can do so with a country that it at present does - the UK. But the Chancellor is also saying a lot more than that. Because the person who proposed \"regulatory co-operation\" on financial services as part of the EU-US free trade negotiations was one Michel Barnier. Read Kamal's blog here. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: \"The Chancellor has shown his hand, and it is clear he is looking for a TTIP type deal as his blueprint. \"Yet those negotiations took nearly four years and collapsed, which is why a transition period is critical.\" Mr Hammond will also say: \"A trade deal between the UK and the EU must start from the reality of today, that our economies, including in financial services, are interconnected, that our regulatory frameworks are identical.\" Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, the trade body that represents the UK financial services sector, said: \"Thousands of customers and businesses in Europe rely on access to financial services from the UK. It is in everyone's interests for this vital cross-border trade to continue.\" ",

        "content": "Archbishop \u00d3scar Romero, who was killed in 1980 while he was celebrating Mass in El Salvador, will be declared a saint, Pope Francis has announced. Pope Paul VI, who oversaw many of the reforms the Catholic Church underwent in the 1960s, will also be made a saint, the Vatican said. A statement said that Pope Francis signed decrees on Tuesday giving the green light for their canonisation. \u00d3scar Romero is revered in his native El Salvador for denouncing repression. Champion of the poor\nArchbishop Romero was beatified in May 2015 in a ceremony in El Salvador which drew huge crowds. The archbishop spoke out against the repression many of his compatriots suffered at the start of El Salvador's civil war, which lasted from 1980 to 1992. When the US-backed Salvadorean army was using death squads and torture to stop leftist revolutionaries from seizing power, he used what would become his last homily to speak out against it. \"The law of God which says thou shalt not kill must come before any human order to kill. It is high time you recovered your conscience,\" he said, calling on the National Guard and police to stop the violence. \"I implore you, I beg you, I order you in the name of God: Stop the repression.\" One day later, on 24 March 1980, Archbishop Romero was shot dead by a sniper as he celebrated Mass in a hospital chapel. No one has ever been prosecuted for his murder but it is widely believed a right-wing death squad was behind it. He has been an inspiration to many in Latin America who saw him as a champion of the poor and the oppressed but is still considered by some conservative and right-wing critics as a subversive. Making Mass accessible\nPope Paul VI, who was born Giovanni Battista Montini in the Lombardy region of Italy in 1897, was beatified in 2014. Elected pope in 1963, he continued the reforms of his predecessor, John XXIII, until his death in 1978. The reforms, brought in by the Second Vatican Council or Vatican II, changed the relationship between the Catholic faithful and priests. Mass, which had been celebrated in Latin, was translated into the language of the congregation and priests faced church goers instead of the altar. During his 15-year pontificate, Pope Paul VI wrote seven encyclicals. One of them, Humanae Vitae (Of Human Life), published in 1968, was highly controversial due to its opposition to birth control and led to protests around the Catholic world. ",

        "content": "More is known about the substance used in the suspected poisoning of a former Russian double agent and his daughter, the home secretary has said. Speaking after chairing a meeting of the government's emergency committee Cobra, Amber Rudd said the police would be sharing details later on Wednesday. Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found unconscious in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon and remain critically ill. Police want to speak to anyone who was in the city centre around that time. They are particularly keen to speak to people who ate at Zizzi restaurant or drank in The Bishop's Mill pub. Mr Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter were found slumped on a bench outside the Maltings shopping centre. Scientists at the UK's military research facility at Porton Down have been examining a substance thought to be behind their collapse. Referring to what she called \"the terrible events\" in Salisbury, Ms Rudd said: \"We need to keep a cool head and collect all the evidence we can. \"We need to make sure that we respond not to rumour but to all the evidence they collect and then we will have to decide what action to take.\" She said the police investigation was likely to be lengthy and it was important to make sure they had the space to continue their investigation. Earlier, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, head of Counter Terrorism Policing, appealed for witnesses, saying: \"Did you see anything out of the ordinary? It may be that at the time, nothing appeared out of place or untoward but with what you now know, you remember something that might be of significance... \"The weather was poor that day so there were not as many people out and about. Every statement we can take is important.\" Cordons have been erected in and around Salisbury. One, at a business park in Amesbury, a town about 10 miles away, has been removed. Two police officers caught up in the suspected contamination were treated in hospital for minor symptoms - believed to be itchy eyes and wheezing - before they were given the all clear. A third member of the emergency services remains in hospital. Relatives of Col Skripal, who was convicted in Russia in 2006 of spying for Britain, have told the BBC Russian Service that he believed the country's special services might come after him at any time. It has been said his only friends in the UK are in the British intelligence services, but he has also joined his local railway club and given lectures at military academies. His wife, elder brother and son have all died in recent years. Ms Skripal lives in Moscow and has visited her father in the UK regularly, especially during the past two years. Family and friends say she did move to the UK but missed Russia so returned to Moscow where she has worked for multinationals, including Nike and PepsiCo. It is thought her latest visit to the UK may have been timed to coincide with her late brother's birthday. Alexander Skripal died aged 43 last July in St Petersburg from liver failure in what relatives believe to have been suspicious circumstances. He is buried in Salisbury close to his mother, Liudmila Skripal, who died from cancer in 2012. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning The possibility of an unexplained substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko - a public inquiry concluded the killing of the Russian dissident had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Former MI5 officer Annie Machon pointed out that the two cases were very different, however. Mr Litvinenko was a whistleblower, a dissident and a consultant for MI6 actively at the time of his death, she said, whereas Mr Skripal has already been caught, convicted and pardoned and allowed to freely find safe haven in the UK. \"There's no conceivable reason that I can see that the Russian state would have been targeting him at the moment,\" she told BBC's Breakfast. \"That's why we need to think about what else he might have been involved in.\" On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the case. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, and says it is open to co-operating with British police if requested. The Russian embassy in London accused the media of creating \"an impression of a planned operation by the Russian special services, which is completely untrue\". Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Col Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years. Do you have any information to share on this story?

        "content": "Donald Tusk has insisted the EU \"does not want to build a wall\", but Brexit means \"we will be drifting apart\". The EU Council president said his side would be \"open, positive but with realism\" in upcoming talks with the UK over post-Brexit relations. He spoke as he unveiled draft guidelines on what the EU wants to achieve from the talks. Mr Tusk said he wanted continued security and research cooperation and to ensure flights were not grounded. On trade, he said that the UK's decision to rule out membership of the single market or the customs union meant a free trade agreement was the best option - but it would be, he said, the first such agreement that would \"loosen, not strengthen economic ties\". The leaders of the remaining 27 EU states must approve the plans at a Brussels summit on 22 March, setting the template for chief negotiator Michel Barnier for talks with the UK about their future relationship. The UK is due to leave the EU at the end of March 2019, and both sides have said they would like a deal on their future relationship to be agreed by this autumn to allow time for parliaments to approve the deal before Brexit happens. The draft guidelines say existing fishing rights for EU vessels in UK waters will continue. And the document says there must be limits on how deep a free trade agreement on services should be and it should include \"ambitious\" provisions on free movement of people. The document says the \"four freedoms\" of the single market - the free flow of goods, services, money and people - are \"indivisible\" and \"there can be no \"cherry picking\" through participation based on a sector-by-sector approach, that would undermine the integrity and proper functioning of the single market\". But the European Council \"confirms its readiness to initiate work towards a free trade agreement (FTA), to be finalised and concluded once the UK is no longer a member state\". It adds: \"Such an agreement cannot offer the same benefits as membership and cannot amount to participation in the single market or parts thereof.\" It comes as Chancellor Philip Hammond calls for financial services to be included in any future trade agreement. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has argued that such a deal had never been done before. But Mr Hammond will say in a speech that the EU has in the past attempted similar agreements, such as in trade talks with the US and Canada. \"If it could be done with Canada or the USA... it could be done with the UK,\" he will say. \"I am clear not only that it is possible to include financial services within a trade deal but that it is very much in our mutual interest to do so.\" The EU draft guidelines contain no mention of financial services. The BBC's Economics Editor Kamal Ahmed said the two sides appeared far apart but most people involved in the talks thought a deal was possible. The European Parliament has stressed that its preferred option is for the UK to continue to be a member of the single market and customs union after Brexit, in a draft resolution, leaked to the Politico website. The parliament does not have a formal role in the Brexit negotiations but does have a veto on the final deal. The European Parliament document, which may be changed before it is adopted, says non-EU members - even if very closely aligned to the bloc - cannot expect the same rights and benefits as EU members. It also warns that the UK's current \"red lines\" in Brexit talks \"would lead to customs checks and verification which would affect global supply chains and manufacturing processes, even if tariff barriers can be avoided\". It says a \"deep and comprehensive\" trade deal, of the kind envisioned by Theresa May, must entail \"a binding interpretation role\" for the European Court of Justice. BBC Brussels Correspondent Adam Fleming said the draft will look like a rejection of the speech Theresa May delivered on Friday setting out her vision of post-Brexit trade, but with some \"wriggle room\" and the possibility of much more if the UK softens some of its red lines. MPs in Westminster are, meanwhile, set to debate a Plaid Cymru call for UK nationals to be allowed to keep their EU citizenship after Brexit. Plaid said EU citizenship would give holders the right to travel, live, study and work anywhere in the EU even after the UK leaves next year. A UK government spokesman said only citizens of EU member states could hold EU citizenship. ",

        "content": "A bomb planted on a London Underground train in September last year was designed to cause \"maximum harm and carnage\", a court has heard. Commuters fled in \"fear and panic\" when the train was engulfed by a \"large fireball\" at Parsons Green, a jury was told. Ahmed Hassan, 18, is accused of planting a bomb on the District Line carriage on 15 September, 2017. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. Thirty people were injured in the incident, the Old Bailey was told. The court heard that Mr Hassan originally told police he was responsible for the bomb. 'Fear and panic'\nAlison Morgan, prosecuting, told the jurors that Mr Hassan, an Iraqi asylum seeker, packed a bomb with screwdrivers, knives and nails to cause \"maximum carnage\" on the rush hour Tube. The device partially exploded very shortly after the crowded train arrived at Parsons Green Station during rush hour. Ms Morgan said: \"There were approximately 93 people in the carriage when the device detonated. \"The partial explosion created a large fireball. Some in the carriage were caught by the flames and sustained significant burns. \"Many ran in fear and panic. They were fortunate. Had the device fully detonated, it is inevitable that serious injury and significant damage would have been caused within the carriage.\" The jury was shown CCTV pictures from inside the train showing a fireball engulfing the carriage as people ducked from the flames. The court heard that hundreds of people in the station tried to get down a narrow staircase to get out. But Mr Hassan had got off the carriage at Putney Bridge Station before the bomb went off. He was arrested at the Port of Dover the next day. Ms Morgan told the jury that when first arrested and questioned by police, Mr Hassan accepted that he was \"responsible for the device\" and told them there \"may be a few milligrams traces\" of explosives at his home address. She said the device was made from the volatile chemical explosive TATP and contained 2.2kg of sockets, screws, bolts, nails, knives and screwdrivers. Asylum seeker\nJurors were told that Mr Hassan arrived in Britain in the back of a lorry via the Channel Tunnel in October 2015. He told authorities he was born in June 1999 in Iraq, but had no identity documents. Mr Hassan claimed asylum, and from 2016 lived with foster parents in Cavendish Road, Sunbury in Surrey. At the time he allegedly planned his attack his asylum claim was still outstanding, the court heard. The court heard how Mr Hassan researched the ingredients for TATP explosives and bought sulphuric acid on Amazon. To avoid suspicion, he allegedly used a friend's address for the delivery of the largest component - hydrogen peroxide. The court heard Mr Hassan bought metal items from Asda and Aldi supermarkets the day before the bombing. Device wires\nJurors were told that on the day of the attack he left his home shortly before 7am and took the train from Sunbury to Wimbledon. In a toilet on the concourse, he set the timer on the device before boarding the District Line, four stops from Parsons Green. Ms Morgan told jurors: \"At any point, should he have wanted to, he could have stopped the timer. He could have pulled the wires out of the device. He could have stopped the detonation. \"The CCTV footage from inside the carriage shows that at no stage did the defendant reach inside the bag to do anything.\" ",

        "content": "Theresa May says she will be \"raising concerns about human rights\" in Saudi Arabia when she meets the country's crown prince later. Mohammed bin Salman is starting a three-day visit to the UK amid protests planned against his country's role in the war in Yemen. Jeremy Corbyn accused the government of \"colluding\" in war crimes by selling arms to Riyadh. But the PM said ties between the two nations had saved hundreds of lives. The 32-year-old crown prince is seen by some as a modernising force in the Gulf State. In addition to talks with Mrs May, he is due to have lunch with the Queen, and dinner with the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge. The UK hopes to capitalise on the Saudi economy's opening-up, but demonstrators are expected to protest outside Downing Street against the killing of Yemeni civilians in air strikes by a Saudi-led multinational coalition - backed by the UK and US - that is battling the rebel Houthi movement. The crown prince, who is regarded as being heir presumptive to the 82-year old King Salman, is making his first visit to the UK since taking up the role last year. He is credited with kick-starting economic and social reforms in the conservative desert kingdom, such as the upcoming lifting of the ban on women driving. He also launched an anti-corruption drive that saw princes, ministers and influential businessmen detained, and which generated an estimated $106bn (\u00a376bn) in settlements. However, many have criticised his decisions to intervene in Yemen and impose a de facto blockade of neighbouring Qatar, as well as crack down on perceived opponents of his policies. A new Strategic Partnership Council will be established which it is hoped could lead to Saudi investment in and through the UK of up to \u00a3100bn during the next 10 years. 'Saudis high on wish list'\nBy BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale When this relative novice on the world stage arrives in London on his first global tour since taking office, he will be granted the reddest of red carpets. The Crown Prince is looking for international support for his internal economic reforms while at the same time trying to offer reassurance to nervous international investors. And the British government is keen to transform a security and defence relationship into one that includes broader economic ties as well. The UK also has an unashamed appetite for inward investment from Saudi Arabia. In other words, post-Brexit Britain will need allies, markets and money - and the Saudis are high on the UK's wish list. Read more from James The conflict in Yemen is seen as part of a regional power struggle between Saudi Arabia, which backs the government, and Iran, which supports the Houthis but denies allegations that it is sending them weapons. According to the United Nations, more than 9,000 people, over half of them civilians, have been killed and more than 52,000 injured in fighting in Yemen since March 2015. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - at Prime Minister's Questions - urged Mrs May to use her meeting with the crown prince to call for a halt to \"the shocking abuse of human rights in Saudi Arabia\", which he claimed included a sharp increase in the arrest and detention of dissidents, the torture of prisoners, unfair trials and executions. The PM retorted that the UK's historic links with Saudi Arabia had saved the lives of potentially hundreds of people in this country, but she would be \"raising concerns about human rights\". Mr Corbyn added that 600,000 children in Yemen had cholera \"because of the Saudi-led bombing campaign and the blockade\", and asked why British arms sales to Saudi Arabia had \"sharply increased\". \"Germany has suspended arms sales to Saudi Arabia but British arms sales have sharply increased, and British military advisers are directing war,\" he said. \"It cannot be right that her government is colluding in what the United Nations says is evidence of war crimes. Will you use your meeting today with the crown prince to halt the arms supplies and demand an immediate ceasefire in Yemen?\" Mrs May told the Commons everyone was \"concerned\" about the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. She said she had raised concerns about the Saudi blockades of ports in Yemen during a meeting in December, and it withdrew. \"This vindicates the engagement that we have with Saudi Arabia, to be able to sit down with them,\" she said. \"Their involvement in Yemen came at the request of the legitimate government of the Yemen, it is backed by the United Nations Security Council and as such we support it.\" Earlier Emily Thornberry, the foreign affairs spokeswoman for Labour, the UK's main opposition party, urged Mrs May to use the UK's influence to call on Saudi Arabia \"to stop\" the bombing in Yemen. \"We're in a unique position to be able to intervene in this and to stop the war in Yemen and to do that as a friend,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"I would say our relationship with you is important - we need to be friends - but that it would be wrong for us to lie to you. \"You're going too far in relation to what you're doing in Yemen. \"We're very concerned that you in Saudi Arabia now believe that you can win the war in Yemen. You can't win the war in Yemen - we all know that in our heart of hearts.\" Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning ",

        "content": "The EU has condemned US plans for tough tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, saying they jeopardise European jobs. EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom set out plans to retaliate against the proposed US tariffs. These include higher import duties on bourbon, peanut butter, cranberries, orange juice, steel, and industrial products, she said. On Tuesday, Donald Trump's top economic advisor Gary Cohn, who opposes tariffs, resigned. That was after Mr Trump said EU trade rules make it \"impossible\" for US firms to do business with the bloc. Ms Malmstrom said the US justification for the proposed 25% tariff on steel imports and 10% tariff on aluminium was that US national security is threatened. \"We have serious doubt about that justification. We cannot see how the European Union, friends, and allies in Nato, can be a threat to national security in the US,\" she said. \"We find that assumption deeply unjust.\" What action is the EU considering?\nMs Malmstrom said the EU will launch proceedings at the World Trade Organisation with other members of the organisation. It would take measures to try to deal with am expected surge of steel and aluminium imports into the EU. \"From what understand, the motivation of the US is an economic safeguard measure in disguise, not a national security measure,\" she said. The EU would take measures that match the economic loss suffered by the EU. \"We are discussing different US products on which different import tariffs can be imposed,\" she said. She added that the root cause of the problem with steel and aluminium is \"global overcapacity\" propped up by \"massive state subsidies... under non-market conditions.\" ",

        "content": "Best Buy's computer repair workers have been aiding the FBI for at least 10 years, new documents suggest. They indicate that several of the US company's Geek Squad staff were paid for reporting child abuse imagery. The rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation said that the relationship \"circumvents computer owners' Fourth Amendment rights\" to privacy. The FBI did not respond to questions about its relationship with other repair companies, according to the EFF. The EFF began a Freedom of Information Act legal action to obtain the documents last year, after a doctor was prosecuted for child abuse imagery when Geek Squad technician reported an image of a naked child on his computer to FBI agents. It was previously reported that the technician had been paid $500 (\u00a3360) by the FBI. The charges were dropped in November 2017 when a federal judge ruled that the image flagged by the Geek Squad technician was not sufficient evidence for the FBI to request a search warrant. The judge also ruled that the photograph did not qualify as child abuse imagery. The new documents indicate that the US consumer electronics giant hosted a meeting of the FBI's Cyber Working Group in a computer repair facility as early as 2008. During the visit, agents were also reportedly given a tour of the building. The documents also suggest that Geek Squad technicians report only material they happen to find while doing repairs, rather than actively searching for illegal content on customers' devices. Best Buy said in a statement that it prohibited employees \"from doing anything other than what is necessary to solve the customer's problem\". \"In the wake of these allegations, we have redoubled our efforts to train employees on what to do - and not do - in these circumstances.\" \"Our employees do not search for this material; they inadvertently discover it when attempting to confirm we have recovered lost customer data.\" ",

        "content": "When Sergei Skripal, a former Russian double agent, collapsed suddenly on Monday in the sleepy cathedral city of Salisbury, there were unavoidable echoes of a messy, high-profile death in London a little over a decade before. In 2006, Alexander Litvinenko, another former Russian agent, was rushed to hospital after collapsing in London. As the world watched, a rare and highly radioactive isotope destroyed his organs one by one, killing him three weeks later. A British public inquiry found that Litvinenko had ingested Polonium 210, and that his assassination was likely ordered directly by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mr Skripal, 66, who was convicted as a traitor in Russia and later came to the UK as part of a spy swap, is currently in critical condition, along with his 33-year-old daughter who was also taken ill. Authorities say they are trying to determine if he was poisoned. Russia has denied any involvement, but the case has put renewed scrutiny on a string of deaths in the UK in the past two decades. The chair of the home affairs select committee, Yvette Cooper MP, wrote to Home Secretary Amber Rudd on Tuesday calling for a review of 14 other cases. Those cases were variously found to have been heart attacks, suicides, accidents, and deaths by natural causes, but some allege that they amount to a pattern of state-sponsored murder on British streets. Heartbreak grass\nSecurity guard Neil St Clair-Ford was driving through Weybridge in Surrey in November 2012 when he saw something lying in the road ahead of him. He pulled over and found Alexander Perepilichnyy, an exiled Russian banker, in the fetal position, pale, cold, and displaying \"very faint\" signs of life. Mr St Clair-Ford called a local former Navy colleague, Liam Walsh, to help administer first aid. Mr Walsh told an inquest that Perepilichnyy vomited \"greeny-yellow\" bile during mouth-to-mouth resuscitation with a strange taste, like \"licking a battery\". Perepilichnyy was born in Ukraine and made his fortune as a financier in Russia, allegedly helping government-connected Russians launder money. In 2010 he fled to Britain and began to co-operate with British authorities. He collapsed during a run near his home, the day he returned from a short trip to Paris. Initial toxicology tests on Perepilichnyy's body revealed nothing suspicious and it was ruled to be a natural death. But two years later, a fresh round of tests arranged by a life insurance company found traces of a rare and deadly plant toxin in Perepilichnyy's stomach. Gelsemium, a flowering plant native to China and Southeast Asia, is known as \"heartbreak grass\", because its leaves, if swallowed, cause cardiac arrest. US intelligence sources told the BBC at the time that they believed Perepilichnyy was murdered. An extensive investigation by Buzzfeed News claimed that the businessman was one of at least 14 people US officials suspected were killed in the UK by Russia. 'The highest level of risk'\nThe following year, 2013, Boris Berezovsky, a one-time oligarch and close friend of Vladimir Putin, was found hanged in his bathroom. All the evidence seemed to point to a suicide. He had been suffering from depression and was in debt. According to police there was no sign of a struggle. A Home Office pathologist concluded that his injuries were consistent with hanging. But he had also made himself a sworn enemy of Mr Putin, having fled Russia for exile in Britain and fiercely criticised the regime from afar. Berezovsky's family arranged for an asphyxiation expert to examine photographs of his body. Dr Bernd Brinkmann testified that the ligature mark on Berezovsky's neck did not share the typical V-shape created by a hanging, and instead suggested strangling. The dead man also had a broken rib and a cut on the back of his head. It was enough to persuade the coroner to record an open verdict. \"Anyone Putin deems to have betrayed Russia is at the highest level of risk,\" said Bill Browder, a former Moscow-based financier who led a campaign to impose sanctions on top Russian officials accused of corruption - sanctions that enraged Mr Putin. \"And Russia can get away with brazenness in the UK because there have never been any consequences to Russian assassinations here,\" he said. \"The British government either ignores the crimes completely, as they did in the Perepilichnyy case, or they recognise the crime and don't do anything about it.\" Speaking in parliament on Tuesday, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said any evidence of Russian involvement with Mr Skripal's condition would be dealt with \"appropriately and robustly\". \"I say to governments around the world that no attempt to take innocent life on UK soil will go unsanctioned or unpunished,\" he said. Among the other deaths flagged to the home secretary on Tuesday are those of Gareth Williams, the so-called \"spy in the bag\", whose badly decomposed body was found locked inside a holdall in his bath; Dr Matthew Puncher, a British scientist involved in the Litvinenko case who was found in his kitchen with multiple stab wounds from two separate knives; and Scot Young, a business associate of Berezovsky, who was found impaled on railings outside his London flat after falling from a fourth-floor window. Williams' death was ruled to be \"probably an accident\" and Puncher's and Young's both suicides, and British police say they have found no evidence of Russian involvement in any of the cases barring Litvinenko's. \"British police are under no sort of political pressure whatsoever,\" Tony Brenton, the British ambassador to Moscow at the time of Litvinenko's death, told the BBC. \"If they had found evidence of Russian involvement in those cases, we would have followed it up.\" But the UK government has faced criticism over a perceived lack of action. In the wake of Litvinenko's death, the UK tried and failed to extradite two Russian agents alleged to have carried out the hit. Instead, several Russian diplomats were expelled, provoking a tit for tat response from Russia. The problem facing the UK government now, said Mr Brenton, is that ministers have already levied significant sanctions on Russia over its actions in Ukraine and Syria, and diplomatic relations are already very poor. \"If it is proven that this was murder with Russian state involvement, we will of course do something, there will be lots of anger and probably more sanctions. But we have already used up an awful lot of our ammunition. The locker is quite bare,\" he said. In a statement, the Russian embassy in London said: \"Media reports create an impression of a planned operation by the Russian special services, which is completely untrue.\" In Salisbury, counter-terror police have taken over the investigation. The park bench where Mr Skripal collapsed has been cordoned off and a restaurant where he ate lunch has been temporarily closed. If it turns out to have been a Russian attack, part of the purpose will have been to warn those in Russia against betrayal, and those in exile that they are never safe, said Mr Browder. \"It sends a message to the rank and file that terrible things can befall you and your family,\" he said.

        "content": "Donald Tusk has insisted the EU \"does not want to build a wall\", but Brexit means \"we will be drifting apart\". The EU Council president said Theresa May wanted to \"demonstrate at any price that Brexit could be a success\", but that was not the EU's objective. He was unveiling draft guidelines for the EU side for negotiations on post-Brexit relations with the UK. Mr Tusk said he wanted continued security and research cooperation and to ensure flights were not grounded. On trade, he said that the UK's decision to rule out membership of the single market or the customs union meant a free trade agreement was the best option - but it would be, he said, the first such agreement that would \"loosen, not strengthen economic ties\". The leaders of the remaining 27 EU states must approve the plans at a Brussels summit on 22 March, setting the template for chief negotiator Michel Barnier for talks with the UK about their future relationship. The UK is due to leave the EU at the end of March 2019, and both sides have said they would like a deal on their future relationship to be agreed by this autumn to allow time for parliaments to approve the deal before Brexit happens. The draft guidelines say existing fishing rights for EU vessels in UK waters will continue. And the document says there must be limits on how deep a free trade agreement on services should be and it should include \"ambitious\" provisions on free movement of people. The document says the \"four freedoms\" of the single market - the free flow of goods, services, money and people - are \"indivisible\" and \"there can be no \"cherry picking\" through participation based on a sector-by-sector approach, that would undermine the integrity and proper functioning of the single market\". But the European Council \"confirms its readiness to initiate work towards a free trade agreement (FTA), to be finalised and concluded once the UK is no longer a member state\". It adds: \"Such an agreement cannot offer the same benefits as membership and cannot amount to participation in the single market or parts thereof.\" It comes as Chancellor Philip Hammond calls for financial services to be included in any future trade agreement. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has argued that such a deal had never been done before. But Mr Hammond will say in a speech that the EU has in the past attempted similar agreements, such as in trade talks with the US and Canada. \"If it could be done with Canada or the USA... it could be done with the UK,\" he will say. \"I am clear not only that it is possible to include financial services within a trade deal but that it is very much in our mutual interest to do so.\" The EU draft guidelines contain no mention of financial services. The BBC's Economics Editor Kamal Ahmed said the two sides appeared far apart but most people involved in the talks thought a deal was possible. The European Parliament has stressed that its preferred option is for the UK to continue to be a member of the single market and customs union after Brexit, in a draft resolution, leaked to the Politico website. The parliament does not have a formal role in the Brexit negotiations but does have a veto on the final deal. The European Parliament document, which may be changed before it is adopted, says non-EU members - even if very closely aligned to the bloc - cannot expect the same rights and benefits as EU members. It also warns that the UK's current \"red lines\" in Brexit talks \"would lead to customs checks and verification which would affect global supply chains and manufacturing processes, even if tariff barriers can be avoided\". It says a \"deep and comprehensive\" trade deal, of the kind envisioned by Theresa May, must entail \"a binding interpretation role\" for the European Court of Justice. BBC Brussels Correspondent Adam Fleming said the draft will look like a rejection of the speech Theresa May delivered on Friday setting out her vision of post-Brexit trade, but with some \"wriggle room\" and the possibility of much more if the UK softens some of its red lines. MPs in Westminster are, meanwhile, set to debate a Plaid Cymru call for UK nationals to be allowed to keep their EU citizenship after Brexit. Plaid said EU citizenship would give holders the right to travel, live, study and work anywhere in the EU even after the UK leaves next year. A UK government spokesman said only citizens of EU member states could hold EU citizenship. ",

        "content": "A bomb planted on a London Underground train in September last year was made with materials sourced from Asda and Aldi a court has heard. An Old Bailey jury heard commuters fled in \"fear and panic\" when the train was engulfed by a \"large fireball\" at Parsons Green. Iraqi asylum seeker Ahmed Hassan, 18, is accused of planting the bomb on the District Line on 15 September, 2017. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. Thirty people were injured in the incident, the Old Bailey was told. The court heard that Mr Hassan originally told police he was responsible for the bomb. 'Fear and panic'\nAlison Morgan, prosecuting, told the jurors that Mr Hassan, an Iraqi asylum seeker, packed a bomb with screwdrivers, knives and nails to cause \"maximum carnage\" on the rush hour Tube. Jurors heard he bought metal items from Asda and Aldi supermarkets the day before the bombing. The court heard how Mr Hassan also researched the ingredients for TATP explosives and bought sulphuric acid on Amazon. To avoid suspicion, he allegedly used a friend's address for the delivery of the largest component - hydrogen peroxide. The device partially exploded very shortly after the crowded train arrived at Parsons Green Station during rush hour. Ms Morgan said: \"There were approximately 93 people in the carriage when the device detonated. \"The partial explosion created a large fireball. Some in the carriage were caught by the flames and sustained significant burns. \"Many ran in fear and panic. They were fortunate. Had the device fully detonated, it is inevitable that serious injury and significant damage would have been caused within the carriage.\" The jury was shown CCTV pictures from inside the train showing a fireball engulfing the carriage as people ducked from the flames. The court heard that hundreds of people in the station tried to get down a narrow staircase to get out. But Mr Hassan had got off the carriage at Putney Bridge Station before the bomb went off. He was arrested at the Port of Dover the next day. Ms Morgan told the jury that when first arrested and questioned by police, Mr Hassan accepted that he was \"responsible for the device\" and told them there \"may be a few milligrams traces\" of explosives at his home address. She said the device was made from the volatile chemical explosive TATP and contained 2.2kg of sockets, screws, bolts, nails, knives and screwdrivers. Asylum seeker\nJurors were told that Mr Hassan arrived in Britain in the back of a lorry via the Channel Tunnel in October 2015. He told authorities he was born in June 1999 in Iraq, but had no identity documents. He gave his name as Ahmed Hassan Mohammed Ali. Mr Hassan claimed asylum, and from 2016 lived with foster parents in Cavendish Road, Sunbury in Surrey. At the time he allegedly planned his attack his asylum claim was still outstanding, the court heard. Jurors were told that on the day of the attack he left his home shortly before 7am and took the train from Sunbury to Wimbledon. In a toilet on the concourse, he set the timer on the device before boarding the District Line, four stops from Parsons Green. Ms Morgan told jurors: \"At any point, should he have wanted to, he could have stopped the timer. He could have pulled the wires out of the device. He could have stopped the detonation. \"The CCTV footage from inside the carriage shows that at no stage did the defendant reach inside the bag to do anything.\" The court heard that after \"calmly\" walking away from Putney Bridge station, Mr Hassan boarded bus towards Earl's Court where sat on the top deck at the front. CCTV footage allegedly shows him glancing out of the window as he passes Parsons Green station. He is seen to remove the SD card from his mobile phone, chew on it and stuff it down the side of the bus seat, where it was later discovered by police in a destroyed state. Mr Hassan bought a backpack and clothes and was seen on CCTV at Ashford, wearing a blue Chelsea football shirt, the court heard. He boarded a train and arrived in Dover at around 2.30pm BST where he is said to have bought a mobile phone and viewed the BBC News website which showed images of the scene he had left behind at Parsons Green.

        "content": "NME will no longer be available as a weekly magazine, its publisher has announced. The final edition will be released on Friday after 66 years as one of the UK's most iconic music publications. Its publisher Time Inc UK said the decision to stop its print edition is due to rising production costs and a \"tough\" advertising market. Instead, it will be \"focusing investment on further expanding NME's digital audience\". The magazine launched in 1952 and has featured global superstars on the front including David Bowie, Oasis, Dua Lipa, Amy Winehouse and Sam Smith. Its website launched in 1997 and the magazine went free in September 2015. Musicians and fans have been reacting to the news on social media. Time Inc's UK group managing director Paul Cheal said: \"NME is one of the most iconic brands in British media and our move to free print has helped to propel the brand to its biggest ever audience on NME.com. \"The print reinvention has helped us to attract a range of cover stars that the previous paid-for magazine could only have dreamed of. \"At the same time, we have also faced increasing production costs and a very tough print advertising market. \"Unfortunately we have now reached a point where the free weekly magazine is no longer financially viable.\" Rock band Shame will feature on the final weekly print cover. NME will continue to publish special issues in print, such as its new paid-for series NME Gold. Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

They are defying a curfew imposed after a Buddhist youth died during an altercation with a group of Muslims. Three police were injured in overnight clashes in a suburb of Kandy in central Sri Lanka and a state of emergency has been declared in the area. All police leave has been cancelled and authorities are blocking social media. \"Access to certain social media sites and messaging platforms will be restricted with immediate effect until further notice,\" said a statement from Sri Lanka's largest mobile phone provider Dialog. A senior government minister told the BBC Facebook, WhatsApp and other social platforms were being used to carry hate speech and misinformation aimed at inciting more violence. Last week, the eastern town of Ampara also saw anti-Muslim violence over a dispute in a shop. The authorities feared retaliation after a young Muslim man's body was found in a burnt-out building in Kandy on Tuesday. Fresh clashes between Sinhala and Muslim mobs erupted in several areas overnight, and a number of properties were set on fire. \"The police arrested seven people. Three police officers were injured from the incidents,\" police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara told Reuters. Tension has been on the rise in Buddhist-majority Sri Lanka since 2012, said to have been fuelled by hardline Buddhists. Under the state of emergency, the authorities are able to arrest and detain suspects for long periods, and deploy forces where needed. It is the first time in seven years Sri Lanka has imposed the measure. The country was under a state of emergency for nearly three decades when the government fought Tamil rebels in the civil war that ended in 2009. ",

        "content": "Google has confirmed that it is allowing the Pentagon to use of some of its image recognition technologies as part of a military project. The disclosure follows a report by Gizmodo, which said the artificial intelligence tech was being used to analyse drone footage. The news site said that many of the search giant's workers only learned of the collaboration last week via internal emails. It added that some were \"outraged\". A spokeswoman for Google said that the tie-up involved the provision of software tools to let the US Department of Defense (DoD) make use of its TensorFlow machine learning code. \"The technology flags images for human review, and is for non-offensive uses only,\" she added. \"Military use of machine learning naturally raises valid concerns. \"We're actively discussing this important topic internally and with others as we continue to develop policies and safeguards around the development and use of our machine learning technologies.\" Although Google's former chairman Eric Schmidt became an advisor to the Pentagon in 2016, the firm has otherwise been cautious about being linked to the US military. It previously pulled one of its robots from a Pentagon-organised competition, despite it being the favourite to win, in part because of such concerns. Data glut\nGizmodo identified the drone initiative involved as being Project Maven - a scheme announced last July to use computer algorithms to identify objects of concern from \"massive amounts of moving or still imagery\". The idea is to focus human efforts on sections of footage flagged for further analysis and avoid them having them having to wade through all the other hours of recorded material. The DoD said that its immediate focus would be 38 classes of objects related to the fight against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. \"There is no 'black box' that delivers the AI system the government needs, at least not now,\" said Colonel Drew Cukor at the time. \"The only way to do that is with commercial partners alongside us.\" Google declined to discuss its involvement further. But the BBC understands that the algorithms it has shared were not designed for face detection, but were instead developed to identify generic objects including cars, birds and trees. It is believed that they are not being used to fly or otherwise operate the drones themselves. Google is not the only US firm to be involved. Chip-maker Nvidia has previously blogged about Project Maven and is also understood to be working with the DoD on the effort. One expert said the relatively cheap cost of operating drones such as the MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper had led to a glut of video material. \"The vast quantities of data produced by the US Air Force and CIA - as well as allies like the UK who operate these [drones] in conflict zones like Iraq and Afghanistan - have long outstripped the processing and exploitation capacity of the traditional human-centric intelligence processing organisations within these countries,\" commented Justin Bronk, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute think tank. \"As a leading developer of AI technology, Google is an obvious choice for the DoD to partner with, albeit one whose employees and shareholders might be less than 100% enthusiastic about the prospect of working with the military.\" Mr Bronk added that the UK's Royal Air Force had an even more acute shortage of imagery intelligence analysts, and would probably wish to share access to Google's AI tech if that became possible. The BBC has asked the Ministry of Defence for comment. ",

        "content": "More is known about the substance used in the suspected poisoning of a former Russian double agent and his daughter, the home secretary has said. Speaking after chairing a meeting of the government's emergency committee Cobra, Amber Rudd said the police would be sharing details later on Wednesday. Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found unconscious in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon and remain critically ill. Police want to speak to anyone who was in the city centre around that time. They are particularly keen to speak to people who ate at Zizzi restaurant or drank in The Bishop's Mill pub. Mr Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter were found slumped on a bench outside the Maltings shopping centre. Scientists at the UK's military research facility at Porton Down have been examining a substance thought to be behind their collapse. Referring to what she called \"the terrible events\" in Salisbury, Ms Rudd said: \"We need to keep a cool head and collect all the evidence we can. \"We need to make sure that we respond not to rumour but to all the evidence they collect and then we will have to decide what action to take.\" She said the police investigation was likely to be lengthy and it was important to make sure they had the space to continue their investigation. Earlier, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, head of Counter Terrorism Policing, appealed for witnesses, saying: \"Did you see anything out of the ordinary? It may be that at the time, nothing appeared out of place or untoward but with what you now know, you remember something that might be of significance... \"The weather was poor that day so there were not as many people out and about. Every statement we can take is important.\" Cordons have been erected in and around Salisbury. One, at a business park in Amesbury, a town about 10 miles away, has been removed. Two police officers caught up in the suspected contamination were treated in hospital for minor symptoms - believed to be itchy eyes and wheezing - before they were given the all clear. A third member of the emergency services remains in hospital. Relatives of Colonel Skripal, who was convicted in Russia in 2006 of spying for Britain, have told the BBC Russian Service that he believed the country's special services might come after him at any time. It has been said his only friends in the UK are in the British intelligence services, but he has also joined his local railway club and given lectures at military academies. His wife, elder brother and son have all died in recent years. Ms Skripal lives in Moscow and has visited her father in the UK regularly, especially during the past two years. Family and friends say she did move to the UK but missed Russia so returned to Moscow where she has worked for multinationals, including Nike and PepsiCo. It is thought her latest visit to the UK may have been timed to coincide with her late brother's birthday. Alexander Skripal died aged 43 last July in St Petersburg from liver failure in what relatives believe to have been suspicious circumstances. He is buried in Salisbury close to his mother, Liudmila Skripal, who died from cancer in 2012. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning The possibility of an unexplained substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko - a public inquiry concluded the killing of the Russian dissident was probably carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Former MI5 officer Annie Machon pointed out that the two cases were very different, however. Mr Litvinenko was a whistleblower, dissident and consultant for MI6 actively at the time of his death, she said, whereas Mr Skripal has already been caught, convicted and pardoned and allowed to freely find safe haven in the UK. \"There's no conceivable reason that I can see that the Russian state would have been targeting him at the moment,\" she told BBC's Breakfast. \"That's why we need to think about what else he might have been involved in.\" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said: \"These people have been used by the foreign media for an anti-Russian campaign. \"It's a traditional campaign. The tradition is to make things up. We can only see it as a provocation.\" On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the case. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, and says it is open to co-operating with British police if requested. The Russian embassy in London accused the media of creating \"an impression of a planned operation by the Russian special services, which is completely untrue\". Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Col Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years. Do you have any information to share on this story?

        "content": "Theresa May went head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn in the House of Commons. Here's what happened. The Labour leader went for a double-header this week - starting with a call to end arms sales to Saudi Arabia before switching, rather abruptly, to an attack on the government's \"shameful\" record on rough sleeping. But the exchanges got off to an unusual start with the PM accusing Mr Corbyn of \"mansplaining\", after he reminded her that tomorrow was International Women's Day. Mrs May, a self-declared feminist, gave him a hard stare that would make Paddington blush. \u201cAs she makes her arms sales pitch, will she also call on the crown prince to halt the shocking abuse of human rights in Saudi Arabia?\u201d @jeremycorbyn as he asks @theresa_may about Women\u2019s Day and arms sales #pmqs pic.twitter.com/91h60XAltd End of Twitter post by @daily_politics The visit of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the UK gave the Labour leader a chance to get stuck into one of his longstanding concerns - human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia. Would the PM be raising them \"when she makes her arms sales pitch\" to Saudi leader? Mrs May gave a robust defence of the UK's \"historic and important\" links with Saudi Arabia, which she claimed had saved \"hundreds\" of lives in the UK through counter-terrorism co-operation, but added: \"I will raise human rights concerns with the Crown Prince when I meet him later.\" Mr Corbyn accused the government of \"suppressing\" a report into the funding of extremism in the UK - and called for the suspension of UK arms sales to Saudi Arabia, highlighting the \"humanitarian disaster\" in Yemen he said had been caused by \"Saudi-led bombing and a blockade\". He called for an urgent ceasefire and even accused the UK government of \"colluding with war crimes\". \u201c600,000 children have cholera because of the Saudi-led bombing campaign\u201d @jeremycorbyn calling for PM to demand \u201cimmediate ceasefire in Yemen\u201d \u201cWe are all concerned about the appalling humanitarian situation in Yemen and the effect it is having on people\u201d @theresa_may#PMQs pic.twitter.com/VhI31S1213 End of Twitter post 2 by @daily_politics The extremism funding report had not been published because of \"personal content\", said the PM, but senior MPs on the Privy Council could take a look at it. As for Yemen it was down to \"all parties\" in the conflict to \"ensure humanitarian aid got through\". Mr Corbyn continued to press for an \"urgent ceasefire\" in Yemen - and then switched to a question about why rough sleeping had \"doubled\" under the Conservatives. It wrong-footed Mrs May, who had quite a bit more to say about arms exports to Saudi Arabia, including some quotes from Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry, who, she seemed to be suggesting, had supported her position in an interview with the Today programme this morning. As for rough sleeping, the government was pouring \"millions\" into the problem, she claimed. \u201cWhy does PM think that rough sleeping fell under Labour but has doubled under the Conservatives\u201d @jeremycorbyn PM: \u201cThis is a government that is putting millions of pounds extra into dealing with rough sleeping, why we are piloting Housing First approach in three major cities\" pic.twitter.com/seDts0evrR End of Twitter post 3 by @daily_politics There was a small moment of triumph for Mrs May as Mr Corbyn told her that a rough sleeping task force set up 2010 had never met. \"It met today,\" she informed the Labour leader with a smile. The Labour leader continued, accusing the government of lacking ambition in the face of a \"crisis\" that was \"a mark of national shame\", throwing in a quote from Barry, who volunteers at a homeless shelter in Southampton, who, like him, believed government cuts were to blame. Mrs May said it wasn't just about money or holding meetings - the government was running \"48 projects\" to tackle rough sleeping - before rounding off with a quote from Mr Corbyn who had once apparently said Labour's policies on homelessness had caused \"misery and despair\". \u201cThe growing number of people on our streets is a mark of national shame\u201d @jeremycorbyn Record of last Labour gov't \"described as in crisis and bringing misery and despair\u201d @theresa_may quoting Mr Corbyn, adding: \u201cHe said Labour did not have a good record on housing - I agree\u201d pic.twitter.com/N1KTAoYgUb End of Twitter post 4 by @daily_politics What else came up?\nIain Blackford surely deserves some kind of medal for sheer bloody-mindedness.

During a series of tests, dogs were spoken to in a high-pitched voice and again in a normal adult voice. Researchers then monitored which speaker the dogs responded to and wanted to interact with. PhD student Alex Benjamin said it seemed dogs were more likely to favour the speaker that used a high pitch. Baby talk\nThe researchers wanted to test whether speaking to dogs in \"dog-directed\" speech was useful to the animals, or whether humans did this simply because they view pets in the same way as babies. \"Dog-directed\" speech involves speaking in a high-pitched voice with exaggerated emotion - in a similar way that adults often talk to small children. Dr Katie Slocombe from the university's department of psychology explains: \"This high-pitched rhythmic speech is common in human interactions with dogs in western cultures, but there isn't a great deal known about whether it benefits a dog. \"We wanted to see whether social bonding between animals and humans was influenced by the type and content of the communication.\" Who's a good boy then?\nDuring the tests, phrases such as \"you're a good dog!\" and \"shall we go for a walk?\", were used. Next, another person would talk to the animal in a normal voice about non-dog-related content, for example \"I went to the cinema last night.\" The speakers then mixed \"dog-directed\" speech with non-dog-related words, and normal speech with dog-related words. Researchers measured both the attentiveness of the dog while the speaker was talking, and whom the dog wanted to interact with once the speaker had finished. The scientists found dogs were more likely to want to spend time with the speaker who had used both \"dog-directed\" speech and dog-related content. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning When the different types of speech were mixed up dogs did not show a preference for either speaker. It led student Alex Benjamin to conclude: \"This suggests that adult dogs need to hear dog-relevant words spoken in a high-pitched emotional voice in order to find it relevant.\" The researchers could start looking into whether puppies demonstrate similar preferences, however there are no plans to carry out the same tests with cats.

They are defying a curfew imposed after a Buddhist youth died during an altercation with a group of Muslims. Three police were injured in overnight clashes in a suburb of Kandy in central Sri Lanka and a state of emergency has been declared in the area. All police leave has been cancelled and authorities are blocking social media. \"Access to certain social media sites and messaging platforms will be restricted with immediate effect until further notice,\" said a statement from Sri Lanka's largest mobile phone provider Dialog. A senior government minister told the BBC Facebook, WhatsApp and other social platforms were being used to carry hate speech and misinformation aimed at inciting more violence. Last week, the eastern town of Ampara also saw anti-Muslim violence over a dispute in a shop. The authorities feared retaliation after a young Muslim man's body was found in a burnt-out building in Kandy on Tuesday. Fresh clashes between Sinhala and Muslim mobs erupted in several areas overnight, and a number of properties were set on fire. \"The police arrested seven people. Three police officers were injured from the incidents,\" police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara told Reuters. Tension has been on the rise in Buddhist-majority Sri Lanka since 2012, said to have been fuelled by hardline Buddhists. Under the state of emergency, the authorities are able to arrest and detain suspects for long periods, and deploy forces where needed. It is the first time in seven years Sri Lanka has imposed the measure. The country was under a state of emergency for nearly three decades when the government fought Tamil rebels in the civil war that ended in 2009. ",

About 980 staff face redundancy - from a 15,300-strong UK workforce - and rents at about 400 stores will be slashed. The rescue plan still needs approval from creditors. New Look said it faced \"a difficult trading environment\". Chairman Alistair McGeorge said the cuts were \"tough but necessary\". The retailer hopes to redeploy employees within the business where possible. Mr McGeorge said a key problem was its \"over-rented UK store estate\", and as a result, New Look had held talks with its key landlords, as part of efforts to reduce its fixed cost base and restore long-term profitability. \"The retail trading environment in the UK remains extremely challenging, driven by weaker consumer confidence, the implications of Brexit and competition from online channels,\" said Daniel Butters, a partner at Deloitte, who is handling the New Look Company Voluntary Agreement (CVA). \"New Look is an iconic brand on the high street and the Company Voluntary Agreement will provide a stable platform upon which management's turnaround plan can be delivered. \"It is important to stress that no stores will close on day one, and employees, suppliers and business rates will continue to be paid on time and in full.\" The British Property Federation (BPF) said that although it would be up to individual landlords whether they accepted the rescue plan, New Look had taken the right steps to ensure that landlords' interests were taken into account.

        "content": "British fashion retailer New Look plans to close 60 stores as part of a rescue deal to help it avoid going into administration. About 980 staff face redundancy - from a 15,300-strong UK workforce - and rents at about 400 stores will be slashed. The rescue plan still needs approval from creditors. New Look said it faced \"a difficult trading environment\". Chairman Alistair McGeorge said the cuts were \"tough but necessary\". The retailer hopes to redeploy employees within the business where possible. Mr McGeorge said a key problem was its \"over-rented UK store estate\", and as a result, New Look had held talks with its key landlords, as part of efforts to reduce its fixed cost base and restore long-term profitability. \"The retail trading environment in the UK remains extremely challenging, driven by weaker consumer confidence, the implications of Brexit and competition from online channels,\" said Daniel Butters, a partner at Deloitte, who is handling the New Look Company Voluntary Agreement (CVA). \"New Look is an iconic brand on the high street and the Company Voluntary Agreement will provide a stable platform upon which management's turnaround plan can be delivered. \"It is important to stress that no stores will close on day one, and employees, suppliers and business rates will continue to be paid on time and in full.\" The British Property Federation (BPF) said that although it would be up to individual landlords whether they accepted the rescue plan, New Look had taken the right steps to ensure that landlords' interests were taken into account.

        "content": "More is known about the substance used in the suspected poisoning of a former Russian double agent and his daughter, the home secretary has said. Speaking after chairing a meeting of the government's emergency committee Cobra, Amber Rudd said the police would be sharing details later on Wednesday. Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found unconscious in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon and remain critically ill. Police want to speak to anyone who was in the city centre around that time. They are particularly keen to speak to people who ate at Zizzi or drank in The Bishop's Mill pub. Meanwhile, fire and ambulance crews have been called to an office next to the Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury, but police are refusing to say whether this is connected. Mr Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter were found slumped on a bench outside the Maltings shopping centre. Scientists at the UK's military research facility at Porton Down have been examining a substance thought to be behind their collapse. Referring to what she called \"the terrible events\" in Salisbury, Ms Rudd said: \"We need to keep a cool head and collect all the evidence we can. \"We need to make sure that we respond not to rumour but to all the evidence they collect and then we will have to decide what action to take.\" She said the police investigation was likely to be lengthy and it was important to make sure they had the space to continue their investigation. Earlier, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, head of Counter Terrorism Policing, appealed for witnesses, saying: \"Did you see anything out of the ordinary? It may be that at the time, nothing appeared out of place or untoward but with what you now know, you remember something that might be of significance... \"The weather was poor that day so there were not as many people out and about. Every statement we can take is important.\" Cordons have been erected in and around Salisbury. One, at a business park in Amesbury, a town about 10 miles away, has been removed. Two police officers caught up in the suspected contamination were treated in hospital for minor symptoms - believed to be itchy eyes and wheezing - before they were given the all clear. A third member of the emergency services remains in hospital. Relatives of Colonel Skripal, who was convicted in Russia in 2006 of spying for Britain, have told the BBC Russian Service that he believed the country's special services might come after him at any time. It has been said his only friends in the UK are in the British intelligence services, but he has also joined his local railway club and given lectures at military academies. His wife, elder brother and son have all died in recent years. Ms Skripal lives in Moscow and has visited her father in the UK regularly, especially during the past two years. Family and friends say she did move to the UK but missed Russia so returned to Moscow where she has worked for multinationals, including Nike and PepsiCo. It is thought her latest visit to the UK may have been timed to coincide with her late brother's birthday. Alexander Skripal died aged 43 last July in St Petersburg from liver failure in what relatives believe to have been suspicious circumstances. He is buried in Salisbury close to his mother, Liudmila Skripal, who died from cancer in 2012. The possibility of an unexplained substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko - a public inquiry concluded the killing of the Russian dissident was probably carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Former MI5 officer Annie Machon pointed out that the two cases were very different, however. Mr Litvinenko was a whistleblower, dissident and consultant for MI6 actively at the time of his death, she said, whereas Mr Skripal has already been caught, convicted and pardoned and allowed to freely find safe haven in the UK. \"There's no conceivable reason that I can see that the Russian state would have been targeting him at the moment,\" she told BBC's Breakfast. \"That's why we need to think about what else he might have been involved in.\" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said: \"These people have been used by the foreign media for an anti-Russian campaign. \"It's a traditional campaign. The tradition is to make things up. We can only see it as a provocation.\" On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the case. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, and says it is open to co-operating with British police if requested. The Russian embassy in London accused the media of creating \"an impression of a planned operation by the Russian special services, which is completely untrue\". Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Col Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years. Do you have any information to share on this story?

        "content": "Using \"dog-speak\" is important in building a bond between a dog and their owner, scientists from the University of York have found. During a series of tests, dogs were spoken to in a high-pitched voice and again in a normal adult voice. Researchers then monitored which speaker the dogs responded to and wanted to interact with. PhD student Alex Benjamin said it seemed dogs were more likely to favour the speaker that used a high pitch. Baby talk\nThe researchers wanted to test whether speaking to dogs in \"dog-directed\" speech was useful to the animals, or whether humans did this simply because they view pets in the same way as babies. \"Dog-directed\" speech involves speaking in a high-pitched voice with exaggerated emotion - in a similar way that adults often talk to small children. Dr Katie Slocombe from the university's department of psychology explains: \"This high-pitched rhythmic speech is common in human interactions with dogs in western cultures, but there isn't a great deal known about whether it benefits a dog. \"We wanted to see whether social bonding between animals and humans was influenced by the type and content of the communication.\" Who's a good boy then?\nDuring the tests, phrases such as \"you're a good dog!\" and \"shall we go for a walk?\", were used. Next, another person would talk to the animal in a normal voice about non-dog-related content, for example \"I went to the cinema last night.\" The speakers then mixed \"dog-directed\" speech with non-dog-related words, and normal speech with dog-related words. Researchers measured both the attentiveness of the dog while the speaker was talking, and whom the dog wanted to interact with once the speaker had finished. The scientists found dogs were more likely to want to spend time with the speaker who had used both \"dog-directed\" speech and dog-related content. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning When the different types of speech were mixed up dogs did not show a preference for either speaker. It led student Alex Benjamin to conclude: \"This suggests that adult dogs need to hear dog-relevant words spoken in a high-pitched emotional voice in order to find it relevant.\" The researchers could start looking into whether puppies demonstrate similar preferences, however there are no plans to carry out the same tests with cats.

        "content": "A bomb designed to cause \"carnage\" and planted on a London Underground train was made with materials sourced from Asda and Aldi a court has heard. An Old Bailey jury heard commuters faced \"a furnace engulfed in flames\" when the device exploded at Parsons Green during London's rush hour. Iraqi asylum seeker Ahmed Hassan, 18, is accused of planting the bomb on the District Line on 15 September, 2017. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. The court heard that Mr Hassan originally told police he was responsible for the bomb. One passenger, Aimee Colville, described \"shards of glass flying through the air and then flames\". Jurors heard she could \"smell herself burning and saw her hair was on fire\". Thirty people were injured in the incident: some badly burned, and others injured in the \"stampede\" as they fled in fear and panic, the Old Bailey was told. 'Fear and panic'\nAlison Morgan, prosecuting, told the jurors that Mr Hassan, packed a bomb with screwdrivers, knives and nails to cause \"maximum carnage\" on the rush hour Tube. Jurors heard he bought metal items from Asda and Aldi supermarkets the day before the bombing. The court heard how Mr Hassan also researched the ingredients for TATP explosives and bought sulphuric acid on Amazon. To avoid suspicion, he allegedly used a friend's address for the delivery of the largest component - hydrogen peroxide. The device, which was on a timer, partially exploded very shortly after the crowded train arrived at Parsons Green Station during rush hour. Ms Morgan said: \"There were approximately 93 people in the carriage when the device detonated. \"The partial explosion created a large fireball. Some in the carriage were caught by the flames and sustained significant burns. \"Many ran in fear and panic. They were fortunate. Had the device fully detonated, it is inevitable that serious injury and significant damage would have been caused within the carriage.\" The jury was shown CCTV pictures from inside the train showing a fireball engulfing the carriage as people ducked from the flames. Passenger Jelena Semenjuk, noticed a bag on the floor and a man fitting the description of Hassan, the court heard. She heard a \"loud bang\" and her coat caught fire. She suffered burns to her legs, hands, and face, causing her eyebrows and lashes to be singed off. Another passenger, Stephen Nash, noticed a \"blinding light and the feeling that he was in a furnace engulfed in flames\", the court was told. The court heard that, after the explosion, hundreds of people in the station tried to get down a narrow staircase to get out. Asylum seeker\nMr Hassan had got off the carriage at Putney Bridge Station before the bomb went off. He was arrested at the Port of Dover the next day. Ms Morgan told the jury that when first arrested and questioned by police, Mr Hassan accepted that he was \"responsible for the device\" and told them there \"may be a few milligrams traces\" of explosives at his home address. She said the device was made from the volatile chemical explosive TATP and contained 2.2kg of sockets, screws, bolts, nails, knives and screwdrivers. Jurors were told that Mr Hassan arrived in Britain in the back of a lorry via the Channel Tunnel in October 2015. He told authorities he was born in June 1999 in Iraq, but had no identity documents. He gave his name as Ahmed Hassan Mohammed Ali. Mr Hassan claimed asylum, and from 2016 lived with foster parents in Cavendish Road, Sunbury in Surrey. At the time he allegedly planned his attack his asylum claim was still outstanding, the court heard. Jurors were told that on the day of the attack he left his home shortly before 7am and took the train from Sunbury to Wimbledon. In a toilet on the concourse, he set the timer on the device before boarding the District Line, four stops from Parsons Green. Ms Morgan told jurors: \"At any point, should he have wanted to, he could have stopped the timer. He could have pulled the wires out of the device. He could have stopped the detonation. \"The CCTV footage from inside the carriage shows that at no stage did the defendant reach inside the bag to do anything.\" SD card\nThe court heard that after \"calmly\" walking away from Putney Bridge station, Mr Hassan boarded bus towards Earl's Court where sat on the top deck at the front. CCTV footage allegedly shows him glancing out of the window as he passes Parsons Green station. He is seen to remove the SD card from his mobile phone, chew on it and stuff it down the side of the bus seat, where it was later discovered by police in a destroyed state. Mr Hassan bought a backpack and clothes and was seen on CCTV at Ashford, wearing a blue Chelsea football shirt, the court heard. He boarded a train and arrived in Dover at around 2.30pm BST where he is said to have bought a mobile phone and viewed the BBC News website which showed images of the scene he had left behind at Parsons Green.

Really sad to hear @NME will no longer print. Going to miss getting my copy every Friday at the bus stop \ud83d\ude1f End of Twitter post by @naomijanewrites NME is shutting its print operations down. Gutted to hear it but since I haven't brought it in years I'm also part of the reason... End of Twitter post by @scarlettgaul Time Inc's UK group managing director Paul Cheal said: \"NME is one of the most iconic brands in British media and our move to free print has helped to propel the brand to its biggest ever audience on NME.com. \"The print reinvention has helped us to attract a range of cover stars that the previous paid-for magazine could only have dreamed of. \"At the same time, we have also faced increasing production costs and a very tough print advertising market. \"Unfortunately we have now reached a point where the free weekly magazine is no longer financially viable.\" Rock band Shame will feature on the final weekly print cover. NME will continue to publish special issues in print, such as its new paid-for series NME Gold. Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

        "content": "British fashion retailer New Look plans to close 60 stores as part of a rescue deal to help it avoid going into administration. About 980 staff face redundancy - from a 15,300-strong UK workforce - and rents at about 400 stores will be slashed. The rescue plan still needs approval from creditors. New Look said it faced \"a difficult trading environment\". Chairman Alistair McGeorge said the cuts were \"tough but necessary\". The retailer hopes to redeploy employees within the business where possible. Mr McGeorge said a key problem was its \"over-rented UK store estate\", and as a result, New Look had held talks with its key landlords, as part of efforts to reduce its fixed cost base and restore long-term profitability. \"The retail trading environment in the UK remains extremely challenging, driven by weaker consumer confidence, the implications of Brexit and competition from online channels,\" said Daniel Butters, a partner at Deloitte, who is handling the New Look Company Voluntary Agreement (CVA). \"New Look is an iconic brand on the high street and the Company Voluntary Agreement will provide a stable platform upon which management's turnaround plan can be delivered. \"It is important to stress that no stores will close on day one, and employees, suppliers and business rates will continue to be paid on time and in full.\" The British Property Federation (BPF) said that although it would be up to individual landlords whether they accepted the rescue plan, New Look had taken the right steps to ensure that landlords' interests were taken into account.

In a speech, Mr Hammond set out his argument against \"sceptics\", saying it is possible to reach a deal. But EU president Donald Tusk flat out rejected the UK proposals. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has argued that such a deal had never been done before. But Mr Hammond said the EU has in the past attempted similar agreements. In December, Mr Barnier said: \"There is not a single trade agreement that is open to financial services. It doesn't exist.\" Mr Hammond said on Wednesday that the EU itself tried to include financial services on trade deals with the US and Canada. He said: \"If it could be done with Canada or the USA... it could be done with the UK.\" The Chancellor stressed: \"I am clear not only that it is possible to include financial services within a trade deal but that it is very much in our mutual interest to do so.\" However, European Union president Donald Tusk issued guidelines on Wednesday telling EU negotiators that the UK will have to settle for a more conventional free trade agreement, such as the EU's deal with Canada. The UK's stance on leaving the single market means the City having to settle for more limited access to European markets, he said. \"There's no possibility to have some form of exclusive form single market for some parts of our economies,\" he said. \"I fully understand and of course I respect Theresa May's [political] objective - to demonstrate at any price that Brexit could be a success and was the right choice. \"But sorry, that is not our objective,\" Mr Tusk added. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier says a trade deal including financial services \"does not exist\". On Tuesday, French economy minister Bruno Le Maire told the BBC: \"Financial services cannot be in a free trade agreement, for many reasons, for reasons of stability, for the sake of supervision because there are some very specific rules for financial services.\" He said that the \"best solution\", would be for a system of \"equivalence\" where both sides recognised each other's standards. But Mr Hammond said: \"It is time to address the sceptics who say a trade deal including financial services cannot be done because it has never been done before. \"To them I say 'every trade deal the EU has ever done has been unique'. \"The EU has never negotiated the same arrangement twice.

        "content": "A former Russian spy and his daughter remain critically ill in hospital after being exposed to an \"unknown substance\" in Salisbury, Wiltshire. Police are trying to find out why Sergei Skripal, 66, was found slumped on a shopping centre bench alongside daughter Yulia Skripal, 33, on Sunday afternoon. Russia has denied any involvement. UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson says the country would respond \"robustly\" if Moscow was found to be behind the incident. So what exactly is going on? Timeline of events\nMr Skripal was found alongside his daughter on a bench near the Maltings shopping centre on 4 March. They became ill around 13.30 GMT, police said. Officers were alerted to the incident by a concerned member of the public at around 16.15 GMT. CCTV footage released by police shows two people walking through an alleyway near the area where Mr Skripal and his daughter collapsed. You may also be interested in:\nThe pair, who did not have any visible injuries, were taken to Salisbury District Hospital where they are being treated in intensive care for \"suspected exposure to an unknown substance\". Two police officers were also treated in hospital for minor symptoms - believed to be itchy eyes and wheezing - and a third member of the emergency services remains in hospital. The nearby Zizzi restaurant and The Bishop's Mill pub remain sealed off as a precaution. The 'quintessentially English' home of a Russian spy Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI as part of a swap. He was later flown to the UK. According to BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban, in recent years Col Skripal gave lectures at military academies offering insights into Russia's foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU. Daughter, and family deaths\nDaughter Yulia Skripal, based in Moscow, would visit Mr Skripal regularly, relatives have told the BBC. Mr Skripal's wife, elder brother and his son have died in the past two years - some in suspicious circumstances, the family believe. His son, Alexander Skripal, died aged 43 last July in St Petersburg from liver failure, Newsnight said. Alexander Skripal is buried in Salisbury close to his mother, Liudmila Skripal, who died of cancer in 2012. Mr Skripal's family deny that he worked for MI6, and believe that the espionage case was fabricated by Russia. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning What are police doing?\nCounter Terrorism Police took over the investigation from Wiltshire Police on Tuesday - but said a terrorist incident had not been declared. They are appealing for witnesses and telling anyone with information to call 999. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, head of counter-terrorism operations, said detectives had taken forensic samples at the scene and were doing toxicology work to \"help us get to an answer\". Scientists at the UK's military research facility at Porton Down are examining an \"unknown substance\". How has the government responded?\nHome Secretary Amber Rudd said police had more information about the substance that made the Skripals fall ill. Speaking after a meeting of the government's emergency committee Cobra, she said the investigation would be \"lengthy and ongoing\" and would respond to evidence not \"rumour\". On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian state responsibility in the case - but said he was not pointing fingers. He said a response could include sanctions, and asking UK dignitaries not to attend the World Cup in Russia this summer. What has Russia said?\nRussia has dismissed suggestions linking Moscow with the incident. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called Mr Skripal's illness a \"tragic situation\" but said \"we don't have any information\" - and added that Moscow was open to cooperating with British police if requested. In a statement, the Russian embassy in London said: \"Media reports create an impression of a planned operation by the Russian special services, which is completely untrue.\" Has this happened in the UK before?\nThe possibility of an unknown substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko. The former Russian intelligence officer died in London after drinking tea laced with a radioactive substance. A public inquiry concluded that his killing had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. What did locals see?\nEyewitness Freya Church said she saw a man and a woman looking unwell on a bench that afternoon. \"They looked so out of it that I thought even if I did step in I wasn't sure how I could help,\" she said. \"It looked like they had been taking something quite strong.\" Another passer-by, Jamie Paine, said the woman he saw was frothing at the mouth and her eyes \"were wide open but completely white\". Resident Graham Mulcock said he saw emergency services personnel attending to two people on a bench from the window of his flat in the city centre. \"You could see the paramedics were really worried,\" he said. \"The man was just sitting there, staring into space, eyes wide open in this catatonic state with paramedics all over him.\" Do you have any information to share on this story?

        "content": "The $7m XPRIZE competition to find the innovative technologies that can map the world's oceans in rapid time has named its nine finalists. The teams come from the US, Japan, New Zealand, and a group of European countries that includes the UK. A technology assessment carried out by the Los Angeles-based XPRIZE Foundation late last year whittled the contenders down from an initial pool of 19. The finalists will now have to demonstrate their tech in 4km of water. They will be invited to do this in turn in October or November. The precise location has yet to be revealed. \"The teams will go to 4,000m depth where they will have 24 hours to map at least 250 sq km at 5m, or higher, horizontal resolution,\" Dr Jyotika Virmani, prize lead and senior director of Planet and Environment at XPRIZE, told BBC News. A pressing driver here is the stated international goal to have the global ocean entirely mapped to a resolution of at least 100m by 2030. Currently, our knowledge of the shape of the sea-floor is woeful. Less than 15% of its bathymetry has been measured in a meaningfully accurate way. Most of what we know comes from gravity observations made by satellite and this method cannot see anything smaller than a kilometre in size. \"We will likely award our prize early next year and that's a full decade before 2030. So, there's no doubt in my mind that some of the technologies in the XPRIZE competition will be able to help in that grand quest,\" Dr Virmani said. The finalists have gone for a range of technical solutions that include the use of aerial drones, underwater robotic swarms, lasers and autonomous surface and underwater vehicles. Britain's entry is Team Tao based on Tyneside. It is a joint venture between Soil Machine Dynamics Ltd (SMD), which makes large subsea vehicles, and the engineering department at Newcastle University. The centrepiece of Team Tao's strategy is a small, torpedo-like robot called a BEM, or a Bathypelagic Excursion Module. The BEM carries sonar to take depth readings, a camera to snap pictures, and can be equipped with a range of other sensors to acquire oceanographic information as it moves through the water column. Such parameters might include temperature and salinity. Team Tao is building its BEMs in-house using largely off-the-shelf materials and components and then qualifying the final designs in a hyperbaric chamber. The one major feature of its system that is being bought in is a 12m-long autonomous surface vessel. This boat, manufactured in the US, will support up to 24 BEMs, deploying them in batches in the designated mapping zone. Through a series of dives over the course of a day, Team Tao expects the robot swarm to be able to get depth data for an area covering more than 200 sq km. \"It's amazing to get to the final. We've put so much effort into this,\" said team leader Dale Wakeham. \"When we first entered we thought it would simply be great to meet and network with people who were doing incredible things, but then when we started working we realised that, actually, we were on to something that could change the industry.\" Team Tao's approach to sea-floor mapping\nThe latest iteration of the BEM concept is now being produced, with the aim to begin trialling the full system on the water in July. Whatever the outcome of the XPRIZE competition, SMD and Newcastle University will have nurtured innovative new business. Prof Nick Wright is the Pro-Vice Chancellor (Innovation and Business) at the northeast university. \"Newcastle University is delighted that our joint entry into the XPRIZE with SMD Ltd - Team Tao - has made the final of this globally prestigious competition,\" he told BBC News. \"It highlights the outstanding quality of innovative engineering that the team have achieved in a remarkably short timetable and speaks volumes about the remarkable collaboration between the university and this world-leading company.\" The nine Shell Ocean Discovery XPRIZE finalists:\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos ",

        "content": "British fashion retailer New Look plans to close 60 stores as part of a rescue deal to help it avoid going into administration. About 980 staff face redundancy - from a 15,300-strong UK workforce - and rents at about 400 stores will be slashed. The rescue plan still needs approval from creditors. New Look said it faced \"a difficult trading environment\". Chairman Alistair McGeorge said the cuts were \"tough but necessary\". The retailer hopes to redeploy employees within the business where possible. Mr McGeorge said a key problem was New Look's \"over-rented UK store estate\". As a result, the retailer - which has 593 stores in total - has held talks with its landlords in a bid to reduce its fixed costs and restore profitability. It has also been struggling with an \"extremely challenging\" retail market, said Daniel Butters, a partner at Deloitte, which is handling the New Look Company Voluntary Agreement (CVA) - creditors to come to a compromise agreement and avoid an administration or liquidation \"[This has been] driven by weaker consumer confidence, the implications of Brexit and competition from online channels,\" he said. \"New Look is an iconic brand on the High Street and the Company Voluntary Agreement will provide a stable platform upon which management's turnaround plan can be delivered. \"It is important to stress that no stores will close on day one, and employees, suppliers and business rates will continue to be paid on time and in full.\" High Street slowdown\nA glut of UK retailers have made closures or gone bust in recent months amid a slowdown on the High Street. Last week toy store chain Toys r Us fell into administration, along with electronics retailer Maplin, leaving thousands of jobs at risk. Restaurant chains Byron and Prezzo have also announced closures, while House of Fraser is seeking to shore up its finances.

        "content": "British fashion retailer New Look plans to close 60 stores as part of a rescue deal to help it avoid going into administration. About 980 staff face redundancy - from a 15,300-strong UK workforce - and rents at about 400 stores will be slashed. The rescue plan still needs approval from creditors. New Look said it faced \"a difficult trading environment\". Chairman Alistair McGeorge said the cuts were \"tough but necessary\". The retailer hopes to redeploy employees within the business where possible. Mr McGeorge said a key problem was New Look's \"over-rented UK store estate\". As a result, the retailer - which has 593 stores in total - has held talks with its landlords in a bid to reduce its fixed costs and restore profitability. It has also been struggling with an \"extremely challenging\" retail market, said Daniel Butters, a partner at Deloitte, which is handling the New Look Company Voluntary Agreement (CVA) - creditors to come to a compromise agreement and avoid an administration or liquidation \"[This has been] driven by weaker consumer confidence, the implications of Brexit and competition from online channels,\" he said. \"New Look is an iconic brand on the High Street and the Company Voluntary Agreement will provide a stable platform upon which management's turnaround plan can be delivered. \"It is important to stress that no stores will close on day one, and employees, suppliers and business rates will continue to be paid on time and in full.\" High Street slowdown\nA glut of UK retailers have made closures or gone bust in recent months amid a slowdown on the High Street. Last week toy store chain Toys r Us fell into administration, along with electronics retailer Maplin, leaving thousands of jobs at risk. Restaurant chains Byron and Prezzo have also announced closures, while House of Fraser is seeking to shore up its finances.

        "content": "Chancellor Philip Hammond has told European leaders that it is in the \"mutual interest\" of both the UK and the EU to include financial services in a free trade agreement. In a speech, Mr Hammond set out his argument against \"sceptics\", saying it is possible to reach a deal. But EU president Donald Tusk flat out rejected the UK proposals. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has argued that such a deal had never been done before. But Mr Hammond said the EU has in the past attempted similar agreements. In December, Mr Barnier said: \"There is not a single trade agreement that is open to financial services. It doesn't exist.\" Mr Hammond said on Wednesday that the EU itself tried to include financial services on trade deals with the US and Canada. He said: \"If it could be done with Canada or the USA... it could be done with the UK.\" The Chancellor stressed: \"I am clear not only that it is possible to include financial services within a trade deal but that it is very much in our mutual interest to do so.\" However, European Union president Donald Tusk issued guidelines on Wednesday telling EU negotiators that the UK will have to settle for a more conventional free trade agreement, such as the EU's deal with Canada. The UK's stance on leaving the single market means the City having to settle for more limited access to European markets, he said. \"There's no possibility to have some form of exclusive form single market for some parts of our economies,\" he said. \"I fully understand and of course I respect Theresa May's [political] objective - to demonstrate at any price that Brexit could be a success and was the right choice. \"But sorry, that is not our objective,\" Mr Tusk added. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier says a trade deal including financial services \"does not exist\". Mr Hammond said it did not surprise him that the EU had set out a tough position. On Tuesday, French economy minister Bruno Le Maire told the BBC: \"Financial services cannot be in a free trade agreement, for many reasons, for reasons of stability, for the sake of supervision because there are some very specific rules for financial services.\" He said that the \"best solution\", would be for a system of \"equivalence\" where both sides recognised each other's standards. But Mr Hammond said: \"It is time to address the sceptics who say a trade deal including financial services cannot be done because it has never been done before. \"To them I say 'every trade deal the EU has ever done has been unique'. \"The EU has never negotiated the same arrangement twice. It has bespoke relationships with Turkey, Canada, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland.\" Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, economics editor\nIn his speech on UK-EU co-operation post-Brexit, the Chancellor referred to past attempts at forging a free trade agreement between the US and Europe. \"The EU itself pursued ambitious financial services co-operation in its proposals for TTIP [the now aborted Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership],\" Mr Hammond said. \"Which it described as a partnership that would be: 'more than a traditional free trade agreement'.\" Mr Hammond argued that if the EU tried it before with a nation which doesn't have regulatory alignment on financial services - America - then surely it can do so with a country that it at present does - the UK. But the Chancellor also said a lot more than that. Because the person who proposed \"regulatory co-operation\" on financial services as part of the EU-US free trade negotiations was one Michel Barnier. Read Kamal's blog here. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: \"The Chancellor has shown his hand, and it is clear he is looking for a TTIP type deal as his blueprint. \"Yet those negotiations took nearly four years and collapsed, which is why a transition period is critical.\" Mr Hammond also said: \"A trade deal between the UK and the EU must start from the reality of today, that our economies, including in financial services, are interconnected, that our regulatory frameworks are identical.\" Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, the trade body that represents the UK financial services sector, said: \"Thousands of customers and businesses in Europe rely on access to financial services from the UK. It is in everyone's interests for this vital cross-border trade to continue.\" ",

        "content": "Donald Tusk has insisted the EU \"does not want to build a wall\", but Brexit means \"we will be drifting apart\". The EU Council president said Theresa May wanted to \"demonstrate at any price that Brexit could be a success\", but that was not the EU's objective. He was unveiling draft guidelines for the EU side for negotiations on post-Brexit relations with the UK. Mr Tusk said the EU wanted an \"ambitious and advanced\" free trade agreement with zero tariffs on goods. But, he added: \"Our agreement will not make trade between the UK and EU frictionless or smoother. \"It will make it more complicated and costly than today for all of us. This is the essence of Brexit.\" He said it would be the first time in history that a free trade agreement would \"loosen, not strengthen, economic ties\". Donald Tusk doesn't share Theresa May's objective\nWhat the EU wants\nThe draft European Council guidelines call for zero-tariff trade in goods. The document also says access for services will be limited by the fact that the UK will be outside the EU and will no longer share a common regulatory and judiciary framework. The draft guidelines repeat EU warnings that there can be \"no cherry-picking\" of participation in the single market for particular sectors of industry - although it does not mention financial services by name. Existing reciprocal fishing rights for EU vessels in UK waters should continue, it states, and there should be \"appropriate\" customs co-operation. Mr Tusk said he wanted continued security and research cooperation and to ensure flights were not grounded. The draft guidelines also say that the EU will \"preserve its autonomy as regards its decision-making, which excludes participation of the United Kingdom as a third-country to EU Institutions, agencies or bodies\". What the UK wants\nMrs May acknowledged in her Mansion House speech on Brexit on Friday that neither side would get everything they want from negotiations. But she also stressed that the UK wanted a bespoke trade deal, rather than an \"off-the-shelf\" model. \"The fact is that every free trade agreement has varying market access depending on the respective interests of the countries involved,\" she said. \"If this is cherry-picking, then every trade arrangement is cherry-picking.\" She also said: \"We will also want to explore with the EU, the terms on which the UK could remain part of EU agencies.\" This appears to be in conflict with the EU draft guidelines, although BBC Research has found several examples of non-EU members participating - as a member or observer - in EU agencies and bodies, such as the European Environment Agency and the European Medicines Agency. UK Chancellor Philip Hammond has told European leaders that it is in the \"mutual interest\" of both the UK and the EU to include financial services in a free trade agreement. But Donald Tusk flat out rejected the UK proposals. Analysis by BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming\nDonald Tusk unveiled his guidelines in a picture-perfect castle in the hills outside Luxembourg. A nice change to the usual venues in Brussels but the same tough message from the EU that the UK's red lines limit what it can get from the final Brexit deal. The best that's on offer is a free trade agreement on goods with no tariffs, and access to the European markets for the UK service sector - but under EU rules and with no specific mention of financial services. I asked a sad-sounding Donald Tusk if his offer came anywhere close to what the prime minister had asked for in her Mansion House speech. His pause was epically long, which suggested he knows it is not. His document is also pretty gloomy, with a spine-chilling warning about the economic costs to the UK. But there is also a big offer tucked away in a later paragraph - there are other options available if the government is prepared to compromise on its red lines. What happens now?\nThe leaders of the remaining 27 EU states must approve the plans at a Brussels summit on 22 March, setting the template for chief negotiator Michel Barnier for talks with the UK about their future relationship. The UK is due to leave the EU at the end of March 2019, and both sides have said they would like a deal on their future relationship to be agreed by this autumn to allow time for parliaments to approve the deal before Brexit happens. But the European Council \"confirms its readiness to initiate work towards a free trade agreement (FTA), to be finalised and concluded once the UK is no longer a member state\". The European Parliament has its say\nThe European Parliament has stressed that its preferred option is for the UK to continue to be a member of the single market and customs union after Brexit, in a draft resolution, leaked to the Politico website. The parliament does not have a formal role in the Brexit negotiations but does have a veto on the final deal. The European Parliament document, which may be changed before it is adopted, says non-EU members - even if very closely aligned to the bloc - cannot expect the same rights and benefits as EU members. It also warns that the UK's current \"red lines\" in Brexit talks \"would lead to customs checks and verification which would affect global supply chains and manufacturing processes, even if tariff barriers can be avoided\". It says a \"deep and comprehensive\" trade deal, of the kind envisioned by Theresa May, must entail \"a binding interpretation role\" for the European Court of Justice. EU citizenship debate\nMPs in Westminster are, meanwhile, debating a call by Plaid Cymru - who have four MPs in Wales - for UK nationals to be allowed to keep their EU citizenship after Brexit. Plaid said EU citizenship would give holders the right to travel, live, study and work anywhere in the EU even after the UK leaves next year. A UK government spokesman said only citizens of EU member states could hold EU citizenship. ",

        "content": "A former Russian spy and his daughter remain critically ill in hospital after being exposed to an \"unknown substance\" in Salisbury, Wiltshire. Police are trying to find out why Sergei Skripal, 66, was found slumped on a shopping centre bench alongside daughter Yulia Skripal, 33, on Sunday afternoon. Russia has denied any involvement. UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson says the country would respond \"robustly\" if Moscow was found to be behind the incident. So what exactly is going on? Timeline of events\nMr Skripal was found alongside his daughter on a bench near the Maltings shopping centre on 4 March. They became ill around 13.30 GMT, police said. Officers were alerted to the incident by a concerned member of the public at around 16.15 GMT. CCTV footage released by police shows two people walking through an alleyway near the area where Mr Skripal and his daughter collapsed. You may also be interested in:\nThe pair, who did not have any visible injuries, were taken to Salisbury District Hospital where they are being treated in intensive care for \"suspected exposure to an unknown substance\". Two police officers were also treated in hospital for minor symptoms - believed to be itchy eyes and wheezing - and a third member of the emergency services remains in hospital. The nearby Zizzi restaurant and The Bishop's Mill pub remain sealed off as a precaution. The 'quintessentially English' home of a Russian spy Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI as part of a swap. He was later flown to the UK. According to BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban, in recent years Col Skripal gave lectures at military academies offering insights into Russia's foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU. Daughter, and family deaths\nDaughter Yulia Skripal, based in Moscow, would visit Mr Skripal regularly, relatives have told the BBC. Mr Skripal's wife, elder brother and his son have died in the past two years - some in suspicious circumstances, the family believe. His son, Alexander Skripal, died aged 43 last July in St Petersburg from liver failure, Newsnight said. Alexander Skripal is buried in Salisbury close to his mother, Liudmila Skripal, who died of cancer in 2012. Mr Skripal's family deny that he worked for MI6, and believe that the espionage case was fabricated by Russia. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning What are police doing?\nCounter Terrorism Police took over the investigation from Wiltshire Police on Tuesday - but said a terrorist incident had not been declared. They are appealing for witnesses and telling anyone with information to call 999. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, head of counter-terrorism operations, said detectives had taken forensic samples at the scene and were doing toxicology work to \"help us get to an answer\". Scientists at the UK's military research facility at Porton Down are examining an \"unknown substance\". How has the government responded?\nHome Secretary Amber Rudd said police had more information about the substance that made the Skripals fall ill. Speaking after a meeting of the government's emergency committee Cobra, she said the investigation would be \"lengthy and ongoing\" and would respond to evidence not \"rumour\". On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian state responsibility in the case - but said he was not pointing fingers. He said a response could include sanctions, and asking UK dignitaries not to attend the World Cup in Russia this summer. What has Russia said?\nRussia has dismissed suggestions linking Moscow with the incident. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called Mr Skripal's illness a \"tragic situation\" but said \"we don't have any information\" - and added that Moscow was open to cooperating with British police if requested. In a statement, the Russian embassy in London said: \"Media reports create an impression of a planned operation by the Russian special services, which is completely untrue.\" Has this happened in the UK before?\nThe possibility of an unknown substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko. The former Russian intelligence officer died in London after drinking tea laced with a radioactive substance. A public inquiry concluded that his killing had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. What did locals see?\nEyewitness Freya Church said she saw a man and a woman looking unwell on a bench that afternoon. \"They looked so out of it that I thought even if I did step in I wasn't sure how I could help,\" she said. \"It looked like they had been taking something quite strong.\" Another passer-by, Jamie Paine, said the woman he saw was frothing at the mouth and her eyes \"were wide open but completely white\". Resident Graham Mulcock said he saw emergency services personnel attending to two people on a bench from the window of his flat in the city centre. \"You could see the paramedics were really worried,\" he said. \"The man was just sitting there, staring into space, eyes wide open in this catatonic state with paramedics all over him.\" Do you have any information to share on this story?

        "content": "Theresa May says she will be \"raising concerns about human rights\" in Saudi Arabia when she meets the country's crown prince later. Mohammed bin Salman is starting a three-day visit to the UK amid protests planned against his country's role in the war in Yemen. Jeremy Corbyn accused the government of \"colluding\" in war crimes by selling arms to Riyadh. But the PM said ties between the two nations had saved hundreds of lives. The 32-year-old crown prince is seen by some as a modernising force in the Gulf State. In addition to talks with Mrs May, he is having lunch with the Queen and Duke of York, and is due to have dinner with the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge. The UK hopes to capitalise on the Saudi economy's opening-up, but demonstrators are expected to protest outside Downing Street against the killing of Yemeni civilians in air strikes by a Saudi-led multinational coalition - backed by the UK and US - that is battling the rebel Houthi movement. The crown prince, who is regarded as being heir presumptive to the 82-year old King Salman, is making his first visit to the UK since taking up the role last year. He is credited with kick-starting economic and social reforms in the conservative desert kingdom, such as the upcoming lifting of the ban on women driving. He also launched an anti-corruption drive that saw princes, ministers and influential businessmen detained, and which generated an estimated $106bn (\u00a376bn) in settlements. However, many have criticised his decisions to intervene in Yemen and impose a de facto blockade of neighbouring Qatar, as well as crack down on perceived opponents of his policies. A new Strategic Partnership Council will be established which it is hoped could lead to Saudi investment in and through the UK of up to \u00a3100bn during the next 10 years. 'Saudis high on wish list'\nBy BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale When this relative novice on the world stage arrives in London on his first global tour since taking office, he will be granted the reddest of red carpets. The Crown Prince is looking for international support for his internal economic reforms while at the same time trying to offer reassurance to nervous international investors. And the British government is keen to transform a security and defence relationship into one that includes broader economic ties as well. The UK also has an unashamed appetite for inward investment from Saudi Arabia. In other words, post-Brexit Britain will need allies, markets and money - and the Saudis are high on the UK's wish list. Read more from James The conflict in Yemen is seen as part of a regional power struggle between Saudi Arabia, which backs the government, and Iran, which supports the Houthis but denies allegations that it is sending them weapons. According to the United Nations, more than 9,000 people, over half of them civilians, have been killed and more than 52,000 injured in fighting in Yemen since March 2015. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - at Prime Minister's Questions - urged Mrs May to use her meeting with the crown prince to call for a halt to \"the shocking abuse of human rights in Saudi Arabia\", which he claimed included a sharp increase in the arrest and detention of dissidents, the torture of prisoners, unfair trials and executions. The PM retorted that the UK's historic links with Saudi Arabia had saved the lives of potentially hundreds of people in this country, but she would be \"raising concerns about human rights\". Mr Corbyn added that 600,000 children in Yemen had cholera \"because of the Saudi-led bombing campaign and the blockade\", and asked why British arms sales to Saudi Arabia had \"sharply increased\". \"Germany has suspended arms sales to Saudi Arabia but British arms sales have sharply increased, and British military advisers are directing war,\" he said. \"It cannot be right that her government is colluding in what the United Nations says is evidence of war crimes. Will you use your meeting today with the crown prince to halt the arms supplies and demand an immediate ceasefire in Yemen?\" Mrs May told the Commons everyone was \"concerned\" about the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. She said she had raised concerns about the Saudi blockades of ports in Yemen during a meeting in December, and it withdrew. \"This vindicates the engagement that we have with Saudi Arabia, to be able to sit down with them,\" she said. \"Their involvement in Yemen came at the request of the legitimate government of the Yemen, it is backed by the United Nations Security Council and as such we support it.\" Earlier Emily Thornberry, the foreign affairs spokeswoman for Labour, the UK's main opposition party, urged Mrs May to use the UK's influence to call on Saudi Arabia \"to stop\" the bombing in Yemen. \"We're in a unique position to be able to intervene in this and to stop the war in Yemen and to do that as a friend,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"I would say our relationship with you is important - we need to be friends - but that it would be wrong for us to lie to you. \"You're going too far in relation to what you're doing in Yemen. \"We're very concerned that you in Saudi Arabia now believe that you can win the war in Yemen. You can't win the war in Yemen - we all know that in our heart of hearts.\" Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning ",

Paul Golding, 36, and Jayda Fransen, 31, were arrested over the distribution of leaflets and posting of online videos during a Muslim gang-rape trial. Fransen was convicted of three counts of religiously aggravated harassment. Golding was found guilty of one charge. The verdicts were handed down at Folkestone Magistrates' Court. The court heard they had targeted homes and people in Kent whom they believed were connected to a rape trial at Canterbury Crown Court where three Muslim men and a teenager were convicted of rape and jailed. The pair, both from Penge in south-east London, were arrested in May last year. 'Hostility' towards Muslims\nFransen had denied four counts, and Golding had denied three. Judge Justin Barron dismissed the remaining counts against them, and is due to sentence them later. He told the court that Fransen and Golding were \"well-known\", \"controversial\" and \"generate their own publicity\", but his verdict was based \"solely on admissible evidence heard in court\". He said their words and actions \"demonstrated hostility\" towards Muslims and the Muslim faith. \"I have no doubt it was their joint intention to use the facts of the case [in Canterbury] for their own political ends. \"It was a campaign to draw attention to the race, religion and immigrant background of the defendants,\" he told the court.

        "content": "Chancellor Philip Hammond has told European leaders that it is in the \"mutual interest\" of both the UK and the EU to include financial services in a free trade agreement. In a speech, Mr Hammond set out his argument against \"sceptics\", saying it is possible to reach a deal. But EU president Donald Tusk flat out rejected the UK proposals. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has argued that such a deal had never been done before. But Mr Hammond said the EU has in the past attempted similar agreements. In December, Mr Barnier said: \"There is not a single trade agreement that is open to financial services. It doesn't exist.\" Mr Hammond said on Wednesday that the EU itself tried to include financial services on trade deals with the US and Canada. He said: \"If it could be done with Canada or the USA... it could be done with the UK.\" The Chancellor stressed: \"I am clear not only that it is possible to include financial services within a trade deal but that it is very much in our mutual interest to do so.\" However, European Union president Donald Tusk issued guidelines on Wednesday telling EU negotiators that the UK will have to settle for a more conventional free trade agreement, such as the EU's deal with Canada. The UK's stance on leaving the single market means the City having to settle for more limited access to European markets, he said. \"There's no possibility to have some form of exclusive form single market for some parts of our economies,\" he said. \"I fully understand and of course I respect Theresa May's [political] objective - to demonstrate at any price that Brexit could be a success and was the right choice. \"But sorry, that is not our objective,\" Mr Tusk added. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier says a trade deal including financial services \"does not exist\". Mr Hammond said: \"The EU is a very skilled negotiator... they've negotiated agreements with many countries. They are very skilled and very disciplined in the way they carry out their negotiation, and it doesn't surprise me remotely that what they've set out this morning is a very tough position. \"That's what any competent, skilled and experienced negotiator would do. I expect that we will have a deep and constructive engagement with them, and I hope that what I've set out here this afternoon will contribute to the discussion that we'll be having.\" On Tuesday, French economy minister Bruno Le Maire told the BBC: \"Financial services cannot be in a free trade agreement, for many reasons, for reasons of stability, for the sake of supervision because there are some very specific rules for financial services.\" He said that the \"best solution\", would be for a system of \"equivalence\" where both sides recognised each other's standards. But Mr Hammond said: \"It is time to address the sceptics who say a trade deal including financial services cannot be done because it has never been done before. \"To them I say 'every trade deal the EU has ever done has been unique'. \"The EU has never negotiated the same arrangement twice. It has bespoke relationships with Turkey, Canada, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland.\" Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, economics editor\nIn his speech on UK-EU co-operation post-Brexit, the Chancellor referred to past attempts at forging a free trade agreement between the US and Europe. \"The EU itself pursued ambitious financial services co-operation in its proposals for TTIP [the now aborted Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership],\" Mr Hammond said. \"Which it described as a partnership that would be: 'more than a traditional free trade agreement'.\" Mr Hammond argued that if the EU tried it before with a nation which doesn't have regulatory alignment on financial services - America - then surely it can do so with a country that it at present does - the UK. But the Chancellor also said a lot more than that. Because the person who proposed \"regulatory co-operation\" on financial services as part of the EU-US free trade negotiations was one Michel Barnier. Read Kamal's blog here. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: \"The Chancellor has shown his hand, and it is clear he is looking for a TTIP type deal as his blueprint. \"Yet those negotiations took nearly four years and collapsed, which is why a transition period is critical.\" Mr Hammond also said: \"A trade deal between the UK and the EU must start from the reality of today, that our economies, including in financial services, are interconnected, that our regulatory frameworks are identical.\" Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, the trade body that represents the UK financial services sector, said: \"Thousands of customers and businesses in Europe rely on access to financial services from the UK. It is in everyone's interests for this vital cross-border trade to continue.\" ",

About 980 staff face redundancy - from a 15,300-strong UK workforce - and rents at about 400 stores will be slashed. The rescue plan still needs approval from creditors. New Look said it faced \"a difficult trading environment\". Chairman Alistair McGeorge said the cuts were \"tough but necessary\". The retailer hopes to redeploy employees within the business where possible. Mr McGeorge said a key problem was New Look's \"over-rented UK store estate\". As a result, the retailer - which has 593 stores in total - has held talks with its landlords in a bid to reduce its fixed costs and restore profitability. It has also faced an \"extremely challenging\" retail market, said Deloitte, which is handling the firm's Company Voluntary Agreement - a type of compromise deal that allows a firm to avoid going into administration. \"[This has been] driven by weaker consumer confidence, the implications of Brexit and competition from online channels,\" said Daniel Butters, a partner at Deloitte. \"New Look is an iconic brand on the High Street and the Company Voluntary Agreement will provide a stable platform upon which management's turnaround plan can be delivered. \"It is important to stress that no stores will close on day one, and employees, suppliers and business rates will continue to be paid on time and in full.\" High Street slowdown\nA glut of UK retailers have made closures or gone bust in recent months amid a slowdown on the High Street. Last week toy store chain Toys r Us fell into administration, along with electronics retailer Maplin, leaving thousands of jobs at risk. Restaurant chains Byron and Prezzo have also announced closures, while House of Fraser is seeking to shore up its finances. On top of weaker consumer confidence, experts say retailers are battling a \"perfect storm\" of pressures including the rise of online shopping and rising overheads such as the National Living Wage. Many firms also over-expanded during the good years, leaving them dangerously indebted. New Look will learn if creditors have approved its rescue plan on 21 March. The British Property Federation said it would be up to individual landlords whether they accepted the proposal. It comes on the day the government launched its first industry-led Retail Sector Council to discuss the sector's challenges.

        "content": "Donald Tusk has insisted the EU \"does not want to build a wall\", but Brexit means \"we will be drifting apart\". The EU Council president said Theresa May wanted to \"demonstrate at any price that Brexit could be a success\", but that was not the EU's objective. He was unveiling draft guidelines for the EU side for negotiations on post-Brexit relations with the UK. Mr Tusk said the EU wanted an \"ambitious and advanced\" free trade agreement with zero tariffs on goods. But, he added: \"Our agreement will not make trade between the UK and EU frictionless or smoother. \"It will make it more complicated and costly than today for all of us. This is the essence of Brexit.\" He said it would be the first time in history that a free trade agreement would \"loosen, not strengthen, economic ties\". Donald Tusk doesn't share Theresa May's objective\nWhat the EU wants\nThe draft European Council guidelines call for zero-tariff trade in goods. The document also says access for services will be limited by the fact that the UK will be outside the EU and will no longer share a common regulatory and judiciary framework. The draft guidelines repeat EU warnings that there can be \"no cherry-picking\" of participation in the single market for particular sectors of industry. Existing reciprocal fishing rights for EU vessels in UK waters should continue, it states, and there should be \"appropriate\" customs co-operation. Mr Tusk said he wanted continued security and research cooperation and to ensure flights were not grounded. The draft guidelines also say that the EU will \"preserve its autonomy as regards its decision-making, which excludes participation of the United Kingdom as a third-country to EU Institutions, agencies or bodies\". What the UK wants\nMrs May acknowledged in her Mansion House speech on Brexit on Friday that neither side would get everything they want from negotiations. But she also stressed that the UK wanted a bespoke trade deal, rather than an \"off-the-shelf\" model. \"The fact is that every free trade agreement has varying market access depending on the respective interests of the countries involved,\" she said. \"If this is cherry-picking, then every trade arrangement is cherry-picking.\" She also said: \"We will also want to explore with the EU, the terms on which the UK could remain part of EU agencies.\" This appears to be in conflict with the EU draft guidelines, although BBC Research has found several examples of non-EU members participating - as a member or observer - in EU agencies and bodies, such as the European Environment Agency and the European Medicines Agency. What about financial services?\nFinancial services is not mentioned specifically in the EU draft guidelines, but it is shaping up to be a major sticking point. UK Chancellor Philip Hammond has told European leaders that it is in the \"mutual interest\" of both the UK and the EU to include financial services in a free trade agreement. \"Given the shape of the British economy and our trade balance with the EU 27, it's hard to see how any deal that did not include services could look like a fair and balanced settlement,\" he said in a speech. \"Not only is it possible to include financial services in a trade deal, but this is very much in our mutual interest to do so.\" But Donald Tusk appeared to reject the UK proposals. The EU says the UK will be treated like any other \"third country\" after Brexit. Asked about the EU guidelines, which also warn of the \"negative economic consequences\" of Brexit, Mr Hammond said: \"It does not surprise me remotely that what they have set out this morning is a very tough position. That's what any competent, skilled and experienced negotiator would do.\" Analysis by BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming\nDonald Tusk unveiled his guidelines in a picture-perfect castle in the hills outside Luxembourg. A nice change to the usual venues in Brussels but the same tough message from the EU that the UK's red lines limit what it can get from the final Brexit deal. The best that's on offer is a free trade agreement on goods with no tariffs, and access to the European markets for the UK service sector - but under EU rules and with no specific mention of financial services. I asked a sad-sounding Donald Tusk if his offer came anywhere close to what the prime minister had asked for in her Mansion House speech. His pause was epically long, which suggested he knows it is not. His document is also pretty gloomy, with a spine-chilling warning about the economic costs to the UK. But there is also a big offer tucked away in a later paragraph - there are other options available if the government is prepared to compromise on its red lines. What happens now?\nThe leaders of the remaining 27 EU states must approve the plans at a Brussels summit on 22 March, setting the template for chief negotiator Michel Barnier for talks with the UK about their future relationship. The UK is due to leave the EU at the end of March 2019, and both sides have said they would like a deal on their future relationship to be agreed by this autumn to allow time for parliaments to approve the deal before Brexit happens. But the European Council \"confirms its readiness to initiate work towards a free trade agreement (FTA), to be finalised and concluded once the UK is no longer a member state\". The European Parliament has its say\nThe European Parliament has stressed that its preferred option is for the UK to continue to be a member of the single market and customs union after Brexit, in a draft resolution, leaked to the Politico website. The parliament does not have a formal role in the Brexit negotiations but does have a veto on the final deal. The European Parliament document, which may be changed before it is adopted, says non-EU members - even if very closely aligned to the bloc - cannot expect the same rights and benefits as EU members. It also warns that the UK's current \"red lines\" in Brexit talks \"would lead to customs checks and verification which would affect global supply chains and manufacturing processes, even if tariff barriers can be avoided\". It says a \"deep and comprehensive\" trade deal, of the kind envisioned by Theresa May, must entail \"a binding interpretation role\" for the European Court of Justice. EU citizenship debate\nMPs in Westminster are, meanwhile, debating a call by Plaid Cymru - who have four MPs in Wales - for UK nationals to be allowed to keep their EU citizenship after Brexit. Plaid said EU citizenship would give holders the right to travel, live, study and work anywhere in the EU even after the UK leaves next year. A UK government spokesman said only citizens of EU member states could hold EU citizenship. ",

David Wagstaff had previously admitted eight counts of the lesser charge of causing death by careless driving. Wagstaff, 54, was on a hands-free call when his lorry forced a minibus under a stationary lorry in lane one. The driver of the other lorry involved, Ryszard Masierak, 31, was convicted on Tuesday of dangerous driving charges. The pair are due to be sentenced at Aylesbury Crown Court on 23 March. Wagstaff described what happened as a \"lack of concentration\" and was also cleared of four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving by the jury at Reading Crown Court, charges that Masierak had also been found guilty of. Fed Ex driver Wagstaff put his head in his hands when he sat down after the verdicts had been given and Judge Francis Sheridan paid tribute to the jury in what he described as a \"very emotional and heartbreaking\" case. The court heard AIM Logistics driver Masierak was at twice the drink-drive limit when he stopped his vehicle in the carriageway near Newport Pagnell on 26 August last year. After 03:00 BST, a minibus being driven by Cyriac Joseph carrying 11 Indian tourists from Nottingham to London on their way to Disneyland Paris pulled up behind Masierak's vehicle with its hazards on waiting to go around. Wagstaff, who had been on a hands-free call for an hour, ploughed into the back of the minibus, without swerving or braking, and forced it into and under Mr Masierak's vehicle, the court heard. ",

        "content": "Theresa May says she will be \"raising concerns about human rights\" in Saudi Arabia as she begins talks with the country's crown prince. Mohammed bin Salman is starting a three-day visit to the UK amid protests planned against his country's role in the war in Yemen. Jeremy Corbyn accused the government of \"colluding\" in war crimes by selling arms to Riyadh. But the PM said ties between the two nations had saved hundreds of lives. The 32-year-old crown prince, who has just arrived in Downing Street for a meeting with Mrs May, is seen by some as a modernising force in the Gulf State. He has already had lunch with the Queen and Duke of York, and is due to have dinner with the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge. The UK hopes to capitalise on the Saudi economy's opening-up, but demonstrators are expected to protest outside Downing Street against the killing of Yemeni civilians in air strikes by a Saudi-led multinational coalition - backed by the UK and US - that is battling the rebel Houthi movement. The crown prince, who is regarded as being heir presumptive to the 82-year old King Salman, is making his first visit to the UK since taking up the role last year. He is credited with kick-starting economic and social reforms in the conservative desert kingdom, such as the upcoming lifting of the ban on women driving. He also launched an anti-corruption drive that saw princes, ministers and influential businessmen detained, and which generated an estimated $106bn (\u00a376bn) in settlements. However, many have criticised his decisions to intervene in Yemen and impose a de facto blockade of neighbouring Qatar, as well as crack down on perceived opponents of his policies. A new Strategic Partnership Council will be established which it is hoped could lead to Saudi investment in and through the UK of up to \u00a3100bn during the next 10 years. 'Saudis high on wish list'\nBy BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale When this relative novice on the world stage arrives in London on his first global tour since taking office, he will be granted the reddest of red carpets. The Crown Prince is looking for international support for his internal economic reforms while at the same time trying to offer reassurance to nervous international investors. And the British government is keen to transform a security and defence relationship into one that includes broader economic ties as well. The UK also has an unashamed appetite for inward investment from Saudi Arabia. In other words, post-Brexit Britain will need allies, markets and money - and the Saudis are high on the UK's wish list. Read more from James The conflict in Yemen is seen as part of a regional power struggle between Saudi Arabia, which backs the government, and Iran, which supports the Houthis but denies allegations that it is sending them weapons. According to the United Nations, more than 9,000 people, over half of them civilians, have been killed and more than 52,000 injured in fighting in Yemen since March 2015. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - at Prime Minister's Questions - urged Mrs May to use her meeting with the crown prince to call for a halt to \"the shocking abuse of human rights in Saudi Arabia\", which he claimed included a sharp increase in the arrest and detention of dissidents, the torture of prisoners, unfair trials and executions. The PM retorted that the UK's historic links with Saudi Arabia had saved the lives of potentially hundreds of people in this country, but she would be \"raising concerns about human rights\". Mr Corbyn added that 600,000 children in Yemen had cholera \"because of the Saudi-led bombing campaign and the blockade\", and asked why British arms sales to Saudi Arabia had \"sharply increased\". \"Germany has suspended arms sales to Saudi Arabia but British arms sales have sharply increased, and British military advisers are directing war,\" he said. \"It cannot be right that her government is colluding in what the United Nations says is evidence of war crimes. Will you use your meeting today with the crown prince to halt the arms supplies and demand an immediate ceasefire in Yemen?\" Mrs May told the Commons everyone was \"concerned\" about the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. She said she had raised concerns about the Saudi blockades of ports in Yemen during a meeting in December, and it withdrew. \"This vindicates the engagement that we have with Saudi Arabia, to be able to sit down with them,\" she said. \"Their involvement in Yemen came at the request of the legitimate government of the Yemen, it is backed by the United Nations Security Council and as such we support it.\" Earlier Emily Thornberry, the foreign affairs spokeswoman for Labour, the UK's main opposition party, urged Mrs May to use the UK's influence to call on Saudi Arabia \"to stop\" the bombing in Yemen. \"We're in a unique position to be able to intervene in this and to stop the war in Yemen and to do that as a friend,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"I would say our relationship with you is important - we need to be friends - but that it would be wrong for us to lie to you. \"You're going too far in relation to what you're doing in Yemen. \"We're very concerned that you in Saudi Arabia now believe that you can win the war in Yemen. You can't win the war in Yemen - we all know that in our heart of hearts.\" Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning ",

Paul Golding, 36, and Jayda Fransen, 31, were arrested over the distribution of leaflets and posting of online videos during a Muslim gang-rape trial. Fransen was convicted of three counts of religiously aggravated harassment. Golding was found guilty of one charge. The verdicts were handed down at Folkestone Magistrates' Court. The court heard they had targeted homes and people in Kent whom they believed were connected to a rape trial at Canterbury Crown Court where three Muslim men and a teenager were convicted of rape and jailed. The pair, both from Penge in south-east London, were arrested in May last year. Fransen had denied four counts, and Golding had denied three. Judge Justin Barron dismissed the remaining counts against them, and is due to sentence them later. 'Hostility' towards Muslims\nHe told the court that Fransen and Golding were \"well-known\", \"controversial\" and \"generate their own publicity\", but his verdict was based \"solely on admissible evidence heard in court\". He said their words and actions \"demonstrated hostility\" towards Muslims and the Muslim faith. \"I have no doubt it was their joint intention to use the facts of the case [in Canterbury] for their own political ends. \"It was a campaign to draw attention to the race, religion and immigrant background of the defendants,\" he told the court. During their trial in January, Folkestone Magistrates' Court heard the pair confronted people they believed were defendants in the gang-rape trial. However, in each case, they instead targeted innocent members of the public. They filmed the abuse and then released it on social media and through the Britain First website. They also posted offensive leaflets through the letterboxes of houses in the area where the rape-trial defendants lived. ",

David Wagstaff had previously admitted eight counts of the lesser charge of causing death by careless driving. Wagstaff, 54, was on a hands-free call when his lorry forced a minibus under a stationary lorry in lane one. The driver of the other lorry involved, Ryszard Masierak, 31, was convicted on Tuesday of dangerous driving charges. The pair are due to be sentenced at Aylesbury Crown Court on 23 March. Wagstaff described what happened as a \"lack of concentration\" and was also cleared of four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving by the jury at Reading Crown Court, charges that Masierak had also been found guilty of. Fed Ex driver Wagstaff put his head in his hands when he sat down after the verdicts had been given and Judge Francis Sheridan paid tribute to the jury in what he described as a \"very emotional and heartbreaking\" case. The court heard AIM Logistics driver Masierak was at twice the drink-drive limit when he stopped his vehicle in the carriageway near Newport Pagnell on 26 August last year. After 03:00 BST, a minibus being driven by Cyriac Joseph carrying 11 Indian tourists from Nottingham to London on their way to Disneyland Paris pulled up behind Masierak's vehicle with its hazard lights on, waiting to go around it. Wagstaff, who had been on a hands-free call for an hour, ploughed into the back of the minibus, without swerving or braking, and forced it into and under Mr Masierak's vehicle, the court heard. Wagstaff, of Derwent Street, Stoke-on-Trent, told police he spoke to fellow driver Elliot Brough frequently and on the night in question they were talking about \"rubbish\", including Everton and Donald Trump. During the trial, Wagstaff, who has since been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, said he \"cannot remember anything at all\" about the collision. His lawyer said he had \"vivid memories\" of the bodies in the aftermath of the crash over the August Bank Holiday weekend. The eight people killed - six men and two women - were Mr Joseph, Panneerselvam Annamalai, Rishi Ranjeev Kumar, Vivek Baskaran, Lavanyalakshmi Seetharaman, Karthikeyan Pugalur Ramasubramanian, Subramaniyan Arachelvan and Tamilmani Arachelvan. The four other people in the minibus - including a four-year-old girl left orphaned by the tragedy - spent weeks in hospital following the crash. The court was told AIM Logistics driver Masierak stopped in the carriageway at about 02:57 BST, despite there being miles of hard shoulder available. Prosecutor Oliver Saxby QC called the Polish national's behaviour \"as flagrant as it was dangerous\". He admitted he had consumed alcohol but said this had nothing to do with the crash. Instead he said he stopped because he was sweating, felt weak and had a headache and had attempted to get onto the hard shoulder. Masierak, of Barnards Close, Evesham, Worcestershire, then said he lost consciousness, only to be woken from what he described as a \"small coma\" when the crash happened. ",

        "content": "Is Formula 1 too physical for women to be able to compete? Carmen Jorda from the Women in Motorsport Commission has come under fire after she told ESPN that a \"physical issue\" was the barrier preventing women from competing in Formula 1 or Formula 2. The former F1 development driver's comments have been derided by people in motorsport, including 2009 F1 world champion Jenson Button who said she was \"not helping proper female racing drivers\". Oh Carmen, you\u2019re not helping proper female racing drivers with this comment. Ask @DanicaPatrick about being \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffd enough to drive a race car! She\u2019d kick my butt in the gym & she\u2019s probably as strong as any driver on the F1 Grid right now. Physical barrier is not your issue Carmen https://t.co/hbyMzrCypg End of Twitter post by @JensonButton You may also like: The 'proper female racing drivers' Button was talking about may have included stockcar racers Pippa Mann and Leilani Muenter, who both thanked him for \"standing up for female racers\". Christina Nielsen, the first woman to win a major full-season sportscar championship in North America, wondered about Jorda's credentials in Formula 1 and Formula 2 as she didn't \"recall her competing in either classes, which seems relevant to make a judgement\". And Supercars Australia racer Simona De Silvestro said she \"never felt physically disadvantaged\" in a Formula 1 car. I raced @IndyCar @FIAFormulaE @supercars & driven a @F1 car,all were challenging but never felt physically https://t.co/LkTUjNNSOs's frustrating to hear the statement from a woman who has never raced these cars.This is not the way to encourage young girls to follow their dreams End of Twitter post by @simdesilvestro Some people on social media agreed with Jorda, with one calling for an end to \"virtue-signalling\" and asking \"who can judge the physical barrier better, Carmen Jorda a female driver, or Jenson Button a male driver?\". While another said he wasn't \"into supporting a process that sets women up for failure in order to cultivate some sort of equality illusion\". But Susie Wolff, who became the first woman in 22 years to take part in a Formula 1 race weekend in 2014, shared the message that \"motorsport doesn't care about gender\". As we launch the @fia Women in Motorsport #TheGirlsOnTrack the message has never been clearer - motorsport doesn\u2019t care about gender. Performance counts. The more young girls we get entering the sport, the more will rise to the top. pic.twitter.com/Y5Pb34ydmL End of Twitter post by @Susie_Wolff Wolff's photo in the post show her with Michele Mouton, the president of the Women in Motorsport Commission, and GP3 driver Tatiana Calderon, who was announced as Sauber's F1 test driver for this season on Tuesday. And Lee McKenzie, who presented Inside F1 for BBC News, was disappointed that Jorda's comments were overshadowing Calderon's achievement. What a shame the good news about @TataCalde Tatiana Calderon being part of #F1 is being drowned out by the negativity of Carmen Jorda. Looking forward to my pre International Women\u2019s Day talk on women in sport tomorrow! https://t.co/PGM6LBDkv6 End of Twitter post by @LeeMcKenzieTV Additional reporting by Chris Browning. ",

The European planemaker said jobs would be affected in the UK, France, Germany and Spain. However, Airbus UK said the firm did not expect to see any redundancies at its Broughton plant in Wales. About 250 employees currently working on the A380 in the UK are likely to be deployed to other projects. There have been recent media reports of plans for thousands of job cuts at the company. Airbus said that from 2020, it would be producing six a year of the A380 superjumbo, the world's biggest passenger plane. Also from 2020, it would be manufacturing eight A400Ms a year, down from a projected 15 in 2018 and 11 in 2019. 'Responsible manner'\n\"Airbus is committed to managing any implications for its workforce in a responsible manner - as already successfully demonstrated on various occasions in the past,\" it said in a statement. \"The company is confident that it will be able to propose opportunities to most of the affected employees through programmes which are ramping up.\" The A380 and A400M are Europe's largest civil and military aerospace projects respectively. Last month, Airbus announced the latest in a series of write-offs on the troubled A400M, bringing total losses on the project to more than \u20ac8bn (\u00a37.1bn). At the same time, the A380 has suffered from lack of demand. However, the plane was given a boost in January, when the Emirates airline placed an order for up to 36 of the jets. Airbus said the Emirates order provided \"visibility to the programme for the years to come\". \"At a baseline of six deliveries per year, Airbus can produce the A380 in an industrial-efficient way over the coming years,\" it added.

Restaurant chains Byron and Prezzo have also announced closures, while House of Fraser is seeking to shore up its finances. Analysis: Emma Simpson, business correspondent\nNew Look has badly lost its way. Sales have fallen off a cliff. Even online sales were down by 15% in December. In recent years it focussed on younger shoppers, but failed to keep up with the likes of Asos, Boohoo and Primark. New Look is also saddled with way too many stores. It has nearly 600 fashion outlets, an extraordinary number given the rise of online shopping. And then there's the debt. New Look is drowning in it. It currently stands at \u00a31.2bn. In today's challenging retail environment that's a pretty toxic mix. It needs to cut costs - and fast. New Look has got its work cut out. On top of weaker consumer confidence, experts say retailers are battling a \"perfect storm\" of pressures including the rise of online shopping and rising overheads such as the National Living Wage. Many firms also over-expanded during the good years, leaving them dangerously indebted. New Look will learn if creditors have approved its rescue plan on 21 March.

        "content": "Sony has blocked the publication of a video game designed to teach male players psychological tricks to convince women to date them. Super Seducer was scheduled for release on the PlayStation 4 on Tuesday. The title has been criticised for being sleazy and for promoting \"toxic behaviours and attitudes\". Sony has limited itself to saying it \"will not be made available\", but the BBC has confirmed the Japanese company banned the title. Kickstarter had previously suspended the game's crowdfunding campaign. Super Seducer has, however, been released for PCs and Macs via Valve's Steam platform. The Motherboard news site was among the first to notice that the PlayStation version had not been released. Dating tips\nSuper Seducer does not feature nudity, but does show women in their underwear sitting next to its British creator, Richard La Ruina, as he delivers advice. Live-action sequences show the author \"grabbing\" parts of a date's body and attempting to kiss a woman he has just met to illustrate actions the player should avoid. His suggested techniques involve discussing immigration and trying to change a woman's beliefs. The title's marketing campaign bills it as \"highly controversial\", but Mr La Ruina said he had been surprised by the scale of the backlash. \"I did expect a small segment of the population to take issue with it, just like they might with anything related to dating skills for men,\" he told the BBC. \"[It] has received a lot of negative coverage from people who have never played the game. \"They want to brand it sleazy, sexist, misogynistic, and even 'rapey'. I found it all very aggressive and not at all helpful. \" But one games reviewer welcomed Sony's intervention. \"It's not good to sell a product that pushes the idea that women are things that you can press the right buttons to win,\" said Ellen Rose, from Outside Xtra. \"Ultimately it's up to each platform to decide which games they want to sell. \"I don't know whether Steam will be as active - but because of the subject matter, it should at least make it as difficult as possible for under-18s to get.\" ",

        "content": "A second lorry driver involved in a crash on the M1 that killed eight people has been cleared of causing death by dangerous driving. David Wagstaff had previously admitted eight counts of the lesser charge of causing death by careless driving. Wagstaff, 54, was on a hands-free call when his lorry forced a minibus under a stationary lorry in lane one. The driver of the other lorry involved, Ryszard Masierak, 31, was convicted on Tuesday of dangerous driving charges. The pair are due to be sentenced at Aylesbury Crown Court on 23 March. Thames Valley Police Ch Ins Andy Storey revealed outside the court that Masierak's professional driving license had been revoked prior to the crash and he \"should not have been driving at all that day\". Wagstaff, who described his own actions as a \"lack of concentration\", was also cleared of four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving by the jury at Reading Crown Court, charges that Masierak had also been found guilty of. Fed Ex driver Wagstaff put his head in his hands when he sat down after the verdicts had been given and Judge Francis Sheridan paid tribute to the jury in what he described as a \"very emotional and heartbreaking\" case. The court heard AIM Logistics driver Masierak was at twice the drink-drive limit when he stopped his vehicle in the carriageway near Newport Pagnell on 26 August last year. After 03:00 BST, a minibus being driven by Cyriac Joseph carrying 11 Indian tourists from Nottingham to London on their way to Disneyland Paris pulled up behind Masierak's vehicle with its hazard lights on, waiting to go around it. Wagstaff, who had been on a hands-free call for an hour, ploughed into the back of the minibus, without swerving or braking, and forced it into and under Mr Masierak's vehicle, the court heard. Wagstaff, of Derwent Street, Stoke-on-Trent, told police he spoke to fellow driver Elliot Brough frequently and on the night in question they were talking about \"rubbish\", including Everton and Donald Trump. During the trial, Wagstaff, who has since been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, said he \"cannot remember anything at all\" about the collision. His lawyer said he had \"vivid memories\" of the bodies in the aftermath of the crash over the August Bank Holiday weekend. The eight people killed - six men and two women - were Mr Joseph, Panneerselvam Annamalai, Rishi Ranjeev Kumar, Vivek Baskaran, Lavanyalakshmi Seetharaman, Karthikeyan Pugalur Ramasubramanian, Subramaniyan Arachelvan and Tamilmani Arachelvan. The four other people in the minibus - including a four-year-old girl left orphaned by the tragedy - spent weeks in hospital following the crash. The court was told AIM Logistics driver Masierak stopped in the carriageway at about 02:57 BST, despite there being miles of hard shoulder available. Prosecutor Oliver Saxby QC called the Polish national's behaviour \"as flagrant as it was dangerous\". He admitted he had consumed alcohol but said this had nothing to do with the crash. Instead he said he stopped because he was sweating, felt weak and had a headache and had attempted to get onto the hard shoulder.ace Masierak, of Barnards Close, Evesham, Worcestershire, then said he lost consciousness, only to be woken from what he described as a \"small coma\" when the crash happened. Louise Atrill, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said outside court: \"Both men showed flagrant disregard for the safety of other road users that morning, leaving five families mourning their loved ones. \"It's unimaginable to think of the consequences this incident will have on the family and friends of the deceased and those injured.\" After Wagstaff's verdict was given, Judge Francis Sheridan praised the families of the deceased for their \"constant dignity in a dreadful case with very sad, tragic consequences\".

        "content": "British fashion retailer New Look plans to close 60 stores as part of a rescue deal to help it avoid going into administration. About 980 staff face redundancy - from a 15,300-strong UK workforce - and rents at about 400 stores will be slashed. The rescue plan still needs approval from creditors. New Look said it faced \"a difficult trading environment\". Chairman Alistair McGeorge said the cuts were \"tough but necessary\". The retailer - which has 593 stores in total - hopes to redeploy employees within the business where possible. The firm said it had been struggling with its rental costs and had asked landlords for leeway so it could \"restore profitably\". It has also faced an \"extremely challenging\" retail market, driven by weaker consumer confidence, the implications of Brexit and competition from online channels,\" said Deloitte, which is handling the firm's Company Voluntary Agreement - a type of compromise deal that allows a firm to avoid going into administration. \"New Look is an iconic brand on the High Street and the Company Voluntary Agreement will provide a stable platform upon which management's turnaround plan can be delivered,\" said Daniel Butters, a partner at Deloitte. \"It is important to stress that no stores will close on day one, and employees, suppliers and business rates will continue to be paid on time and in full.\" High Street slowdown\nA glut of UK retailers have made closures or gone bust in recent months amid a slowdown on the High Street. Last week toy store chain Toys r Us fell into administration, along with electronics retailer Maplin, leaving thousands of jobs at risk. Restaurant chains Byron and Prezzo have also announced closures, while House of Fraser is seeking to shore up its finances. Analysis: Emma Simpson, business correspondent\nNew Look has badly lost its way. Sales have fallen off a cliff. Even online sales were down by 15% in December. In recent years it focussed on younger shoppers, but failed to keep up with the likes of Asos, Boohoo and Primark. New Look is also saddled with way too many stores. It has nearly 600 fashion outlets, an extraordinary number given the rise of online shopping. And then there's the debt. New Look is drowning in it. It currently stands at \u00a31.2bn. In today's challenging retail environment that's a pretty toxic mix. It needs to cut costs - and fast. New Look has got its work cut out. On top of weaker consumer confidence, experts say retailers are battling a \"perfect storm\" of pressures including the rise of online shopping and rising overheads such as the National Living Wage. Many firms also over-expanded during the good years, leaving them dangerously indebted. New Look will learn if creditors have approved its rescue plan on 21 March. The British Property Federation said it would be up to individual landlords whether they accepted the proposal. It comes on the day the government launched its first industry-led Retail Sector Council to discuss the sector's challenges. It will include major retailers such as Boots and Amazon and meet regularly with government to discuss \"the changing demands of consumers\", retail minister Andrew Griffiths said. New Look could close the following stores:\n",

        "content": "Theresa May says she will be \"raising concerns about human rights\" in Saudi Arabia as she begins talks with the country's crown prince. Mohammed bin Salman is starting a three-day visit to the UK amid protests planned against his country's role in the war in Yemen. Jeremy Corbyn accused the government of \"colluding\" in war crimes by selling arms to Riyadh. But the PM said ties between the two nations had saved hundreds of lives. The 32-year-old crown prince, who has just arrived in Downing Street for a meeting with Mrs May, is seen by some as a modernising force in the Gulf State. He has already had lunch with the Queen and Duke of York, and is due to have dinner with the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge. The UK hopes to capitalise on the Saudi economy's opening-up, but there were some protesters outside Downing Street against the killing of Yemeni civilians in air strikes by a Saudi-led multinational coalition - backed by the UK and US - that is battling the rebel Houthi movement. The crown prince, who is regarded as being heir presumptive to the 82-year old King Salman, is making his first visit to the UK since taking up the role last year. He is credited with kick-starting economic and social reforms in the conservative desert kingdom, such as the upcoming lifting of the ban on women driving. He also launched an anti-corruption drive that saw princes, ministers and influential businessmen detained, and which generated an estimated $106bn (\u00a376bn) in settlements. However, many have criticised his decisions to intervene in Yemen and impose a de facto blockade of neighbouring Qatar, as well as crack down on perceived opponents of his policies. A new Strategic Partnership Council will be established which it is hoped could lead to Saudi investment in and through the UK of up to \u00a3100bn during the next 10 years. 'Saudis high on wish list'\nBy BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale When this relative novice on the world stage arrives in London on his first global tour since taking office, he will be granted the reddest of red carpets. The Crown Prince is looking for international support for his internal economic reforms while at the same time trying to offer reassurance to nervous international investors. And the British government is keen to transform a security and defence relationship into one that includes broader economic ties as well. The UK also has an unashamed appetite for inward investment from Saudi Arabia. In other words, post-Brexit Britain will need allies, markets and money - and the Saudis are high on the UK's wish list. Read more from James The conflict in Yemen is seen as part of a regional power struggle between Saudi Arabia, which backs the government, and Iran, which supports the Houthis but denies allegations that it is sending them weapons. According to the United Nations, more than 9,000 people, over half of them civilians, have been killed and more than 52,000 injured in fighting in Yemen since March 2015. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - at Prime Minister's Questions - urged Mrs May to use her meeting with the crown prince to call for a halt to \"the shocking abuse of human rights in Saudi Arabia\", which he claimed included a sharp increase in the arrest and detention of dissidents, the torture of prisoners, unfair trials and executions. The PM responded by saying the UK's historic links with Saudi Arabia had saved the lives of potentially hundreds of people in this country, but she would be \"raising concerns about human rights\". Mr Corbyn added that 600,000 children in Yemen had cholera \"because of the Saudi-led bombing campaign and the blockade\", and asked why British arms sales to Saudi Arabia had \"sharply increased\". \"Germany has suspended arms sales to Saudi Arabia but British arms sales have sharply increased, and British military advisers are directing war,\" he said. \"It cannot be right that her government is colluding in what the United Nations says is evidence of war crimes. Will you use your meeting today with the crown prince to halt the arms supplies and demand an immediate ceasefire in Yemen?\" Mrs May told the Commons everyone was \"concerned\" about the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. She said she had raised concerns about the Saudi blockades of ports in Yemen during a meeting in December, and it withdrew. \"This vindicates the engagement that we have with Saudi Arabia, to be able to sit down with them,\" she said. \"Their involvement in Yemen came at the request of the legitimate government of the Yemen, it is backed by the United Nations Security Council and as such we support it.\" The prime minister's official spokesman also rejected Mr Corbyn's claims that British military advisers were \"directing the war\". \"We're not a member of that (Saudi-led) coalition; we're not involved in carrying out strikes, directing or conducting operations, or involved in the targeting decision making process,\" he said. Earlier Emily Thornberry, the foreign affairs spokeswoman for Labour, the UK's main opposition party, urged Mrs May to use the UK's influence to call on Saudi Arabia \"to stop\" the bombing in Yemen. \"We're in a unique position to be able to intervene in this and to stop the war in Yemen and to do that as a friend,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"I would say our relationship with you is important - we need to be friends - but that it would be wrong for us to lie to you. \"You're going too far in relation to what you're doing in Yemen. \"We're very concerned that you in Saudi Arabia now believe that you can win the war in Yemen. You can't win the war in Yemen - we all know that in our heart of hearts.\" Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning ",

        "content": "Animal rights activists have condemned staff at a zoo where an orangutan was filmed smoking. A visitor flicked a cigarette into the enclosure at Bandung zoo, and Odon, 22, picked it up and started puffing. Footage of the incident has gone viral. Zoo staff said the incident was regrettable, and that the guard may have been taking a break at the time. Indonesia has one of the highest smoking rates in the world and a bad record of animal protection. \"There's actually a sign\"\nA zoo spokesperson said there are measures in place to prevent exactly this from happening. \"There's actually a sign at the location which says visitors are not allowed to give food and cigarettes to the animals,\" said spokesperson Sulhan. Marison Guciano, founder of the Indonesia Animal Welfare Society, attacked the zoo's management for \"weak control\", but also criticised a wider lack of welfare standards at zoos. \"Almost all zoos are in poor condition... from the cages and feeding needs to the animals' health,\" he said. There have been calls to shut the zoo, located 93 miles (150km) southeast of the capital Jakarta, since 2017. The demands followed online footage of sun bears at Bandung seen looking thin and begging for food from visitors. Smoking monkeys\nThis is not the first time apes have been caught smoking in captivity. In 2012 an orangutan named Tori at the Taru Jurug zoo in central Java learnt to smoke from picking up cigarette butts from visitors. The zoo had to move the 15-year-old out of reach of visitors to put an end to her habit. And in 2010, a South African chimpanzee named Charlie famous for his smoking habit died at the age of 52. The staff had tried to get Charlie to quit for years, but without success. ",

        "content": "Two lorry drivers - one twice over the legal alcohol limit and the other on a hands-free call - will be sentenced for causing the deaths of eight people on the M1. As the trial concludes, the wife and children of the minibus driver killed in the crash speak of their grief. On 25 August, Cyriac Joseph's evening started like many others had before. The 52-year-old driver was transporting a group of tourists in his minibus. Business had been good and Mr Joseph, known as Benny to his friends, was looking to acquire another coach for ABC Travels, the company he had set up in 2013. He lived in Sherwood, Nottingham, with his wife of 22 years, Ancy. The couple had two children; a son, Benson and a daughter, Benita. \"People looked up to him,\" said Benson, now a first-year university student. \"If they wanted to know something they would come to our house or they would call him up. I always saw my dad busy on the phone speaking to, advising someone, on any topic.\" The good-humoured Mr Joseph, once the president of Nottingham Malayalee Cultural Association, called everyone his friend, according to 16-year-old Benita. That all changed over the sweltering August Bank Holiday weekend. Mr Joseph was taking a group of 11 Indian visitors from Nottingham to London to catch a coach to Disneyland Paris. Shortly after 03:00 BST, he was on the M1 near Newport Pagnell when he came across the lorry of Ryszard Masierak, which was parked in the inside line despite the hard shoulder being available. Mr Joseph pulled up his minibus with his hazard lights on waiting to go around the lorry, in which it transpired Masierak was sleeping. Behind him was David Wagstaff driving his Fed Ex lorry. Wagstaff had 250 yards - between nine and 11 seconds - to see the minibus. He did not. Wagstaff's lorry ploughed into the minibus without braking or swerving, forcing it underneath Masierak's vehicle. Eight of the 12 minibus occupants died. Five men and two women from Kerala in southern India, whose ages ranged from their mid 20s to their early 60s, were killed, along with Mr Joseph. The four other people in the minibus - including a four-year-old girl left orphaned by the tragedy - spent weeks in hospital following the crash. The court heard Wagstaff, who had been speaking to his friend on the phone at the time of the crash, admitted to officers at the scene: \"The collision is my fault. I hit the back of all of them.\" He later seemingly accepted his fate in hospital: \"I know I'm going to prison, I have seen it happen enough.\" Wagstaff was cleared of causing death by dangerous driving but admitted eight counts of causing death by careless driving. Masierak, on the other hand, tried to fool the police by pretending not to be the driver. He was found sitting between the passenger and driver's seats. A taxi driver, Ali Alias, was one of the first on the scene and could smell alcohol on the Polish national. When he asked Masierak if he was OK, he responded, \"Can I go?\". Matthew John, a spokesman for the Joseph family, said they were upset by how AIM Logistics driver Masierak had conducted himself throughout the case. Mr John said: \"Obviously these things could happen any time to anybody and sometimes when something happens, when something goes wrong, it's how you react to that. \"Myself and Ancy were in the court every day. He lied about everything, so we feel angry, and he doesn't feel any sense of guilt or think he has done anything wrong even though his action has killed eight people.\" During the trial at Reading Crown Court, Masierak claimed he was a \"careful driver\", but the jury heard he had had a ticket for driving his lorry in the outside lane and for jumping a red light. He also admitted consuming alcohol but said this was not a factor in the accident. He claimed the reason he stopped his lorry was because he was sweating, felt weak and had a headache - something he did not mention at the police station after the crash. \"Ryszard Masierak is a liar,\" said Oliver Saxby QC, when summing up for the prosecution. \"He drove as dangerously as is possible. He was drunk. He was driving erratically and his driving fell far below the standard [of lawful driving].\" While Masierak did not have a clean record, Wagstaff did. He had been a professional driver for 28 years, a job that he loved, according to his wife Patricia. Mrs Wagstaff told the court she first heard of the events at 03:15 when her \"lovely, caring husband and a brilliant father\" to their son, Peter, made a short call to tell her he had been involved in an accident and it was bad. \"He sounded really flustered and said he would not be home soon,\" she said. Since the accident, Wagstaff, from Stoke-on-Trent, has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. He told the court he has \"vivid memories\" of the bodies after the crash. He said he \"cannot remember anything at all\" about the collision and said what happened was down to a \"lack of concentration\". \"Obviously there were a lot of other vehicles that managed to pass after Mr Masierak's lorry was there and that is because they paid attention on the road,\" said Mr John. \"We understand that he put his hands up straight away, but we still think that, if he had managed to stop the lorry, the seriousness of the collision would have been much less. \"So we feel sympathy for the family but we still feel angry.\" The impact of the crash is still keenly felt in the Joseph household. \"I wish I had more time with him,\" said A-level student Benita. \"It was hard and it still is but I'm grateful for my friends' support, my school and everyone. \"And, I don't know how to put it into words, it's just you can never prepare for something like this but I'm trying my best - we all are. We're sticking together, we're going through this together.\" For Ancy, the pain is almost too raw to bear. \"I loved him very much. He loved me. He was a very good husband - I lost everything,\" she said. \"It's a big tragedy, a big loss. I'm empty now. [I have] nothing in my brain also. Everything is gone. \"There is no life for me now. My life is finished.\" ",

        "content": "Are you running late for work and blaming your electric alarm clock? The real reason may lie in a dispute between Kosovo and Serbia, which has affected Europe's power grid. Entsoe, the body representing electricity transmission operators across 25 European countries, said bedside clocks had slowed down by up to six minutes since mid-January. Central heating timers and oven clocks are also affected - but not computers or smart phones. Countries from Spain to Turkey and from Poland to the Netherlands are part of a large area in Europe linked together into an electricity grid that operates at a synchronised frequency. This frequency regulates time-keeping in certain devices. The UK and some Nordic countries are not affected. During the crisis period, Kosovo did not generate enough electricity to meet its needs. According to Entsoe, Serbia is legally obliged to meet Kosovo's demand to keep the European grid stable. But because Kosovo and Serbia are in dispute over the issue - and many more related to Kosovo's unilateral secession from Serbia 10 years ago - Serbia did not step in. This failure to act on time forced the frequency to \"deviate\" - and the drop affected the clocks. Other countries that lost reserves amounting to 113 GWh are seeking compensation. \"The deviation stopped yesterday [Tuesday] when Kosovo generated the energy it needs,\" Entsoe spokeswoman Susanne Nies told the BBC. Surplus energy would need to be generated and fed into the system over time for the balance to be redressed across the continent, Ms Nies said. So yes, you can manually adjust your clocks - but they will automatically be reset to the correct time once the grid stabilises. ",

        "content": "A German court has jailed eight members of the far-right group called Freital, for a number of crimes including attempted murder and terror offences. Prosecutors said the group's members attempted to create a \"climate of fear\" with a series of attacks on political opponents and refugees in 2015. The group modified pyrotechnics purchased in neighbouring Czech Republic to use in explosives attacks. A prosecutor said it was lucky that they had not killed anyone. The group Freital is named after the members' hometown, which gained notoriety over a series of anti-immigration protests at the height of the European migrant crisis. The trial lasted a year, and was held in a temporary courtroom complex on the outskirts of the eastern city of Dresden under tight security. The group were found guilty of two attacks on refugee homes, two on far-left political offices and one on a residential complex. A Syrian refugee suffered \"multiple cuts\" to his face after explosives were thrown into a refugee housing centre on the night of 31 October, the court was told. A federal prosecutor said the incidents constituted attempted murder, and said it was good fortune that no one died in the attacks. Seven men and one woman were sentenced to terms of between four and 10 years. A violent backlash\nAnalysis by Jenny Hill, BBC Berlin Correspondent The backlash, when it came, had a violent edge. After the exuberant welcome to refugees in the autumn of 2014, Germany was shocked by a wave of attacks on refugee homes, angry protests and open xenophobia. Largely focused in the former communist east where disenchantment spilled over into fury at the government which, so the argument goes, opened its arms to refugees but left its own behind. Pegida marched through the streets of Dresden, a mob cheered as a home for migrants burned in the town of Bautzen. And, not far away, in Freital a far right terror cell planned their campaign, targeting migrants and left wing political figures. Today's verdict forces Germany to, once again, examine uncomfortable truths. The migrant crisis destroyed old taboos; what was considered unspeakable just a few years ago is now openly discussed (even in the Bundestag where the far right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is now the largest opposition party). Few, of course, condone this level of violence but a small - growing - number of Germans now support the sentiment behind it. And, in a country which prides itself on learning the lessons of the past, that is, for the majority, a source of concern and national shame. In his closing statements, Senior Prosecutor J\u00f6rn Hausschild said he was convinced the group's crimes were based on xenophobic, right-wing extremist and Nazi ideology. Freital's leaders, Timo Schulz and Patrick Festing, were sentenced to 10 and nine-and-a-half years prison respectively for their role in leading the group. A defence lawyer for Festing claimed the incidents were \"spontaneous acts\", and argued the group was neither a criminal or terrorist organisation. Schulz had previously been given a one-year suspended sentence for a baseball bat attack on the car of pro-refugee activists. Germany has seen a rise in anti-Islam, far-right activity in recent years coinciding with the country's acceptance of more than one million migrants and refugees since 2014. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) far-right political party won its first parliamentary seats in last year's election - becoming the third largest party with 12.6% of the vote. ",

        "content": "The man accused of the Parsons Green Tube bombing told officials months before the attack that he had been \"trained to kill\", a court has heard. Jurors heard that asylum seeker Ahmed Hassan spoke to Home Office officials in January 2016 - 20 months before the bombing that injured 30 people. In an interview, Mr Assan said he had been taken by force by the Islamic State group in Iraq and given training. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. The Old Bailey jury heard that Mr Hassan originally told police he was responsible for the bombing. They also heard graphic descriptions by victims of the explosion on the District Line on 15 September, 2017. One spoke of \"a furnace engulfed in flames\" when the device - made with materials partly sourced from Asda and Aldi - exploded at Parsons Green station during London's rush hour. Alison Morgan, prosecuting, told jurors that during a Home Office immigration interview in Croydon in January 2016, Mr Hassan was asked if he was, or had been part of a terror group in Iraq before he sought asylum in the UK. The jury heard he told officials that he had been taken by force by Isis (the Islamic State group), who had threatened to kill his uncle and brother if he resisted. Asked in the Home Office interview whether he had had any training from the Islamic State group Mr Hassan allegedly said: \"They trained us on how to kill. It was all religious based\". But he denied the Islamic State group had sent him to Europe to work for them. The court also heard that a worker for the charity Barnardos, who spoke Arabic, allegedly caught him listening to a \"call-to-arms\" song. The lyrics translated as: \"We are coming with you to the slaughter in your home/country.\" 'Fear and panic'\nDescribing the attack on 15 September, one passenger, Aimee Colville, spoke of \"shards of glass flying through the air and then flames\". Jurors heard she could \"smell herself burning and saw her hair was on fire\". Thirty people were injured in the incident: some badly burned and others injured in the \"stampede\" as they fled in fear and panic, the Old Bailey was told. Alison Morgan, prosecuting, told the jurors that Mr Hassan packed a bomb with screwdrivers, knives and nails to cause \"maximum carnage\" on the rush-hour Tube. Jurors heard he bought metal items from Asda and Aldi supermarkets the day before the bombing. The court heard how Mr Hassan also researched the ingredients for TATP explosives and bought sulphuric acid on Amazon. To avoid suspicion, he allegedly used a friend's address for the delivery of the largest component - hydrogen peroxide. The device, which was on a timer, partially exploded very shortly after the crowded train arrived at Parsons Green Station during rush hour. Ms Morgan said: \"There were approximately 93 people in the carriage when the device detonated. \"The partial explosion created a large fireball. Some in the carriage were caught by the flames and sustained significant burns. \"Many ran in fear and panic. They were fortunate. Had the device fully detonated, it is inevitable that serious injury and significant damage would have been caused within the carriage.\" The court heard that, after the explosion, hundreds of people in the station tried to escape down a narrow staircase. Asylum seeker\nMr Hassan had got off the carriage at Putney Bridge Station before the bomb went off. He was arrested at the Port of Dover the next day. Ms Morgan told the jury that when first arrested and questioned by police, Mr Hassan accepted that he was \"responsible for the device\" and told them there \"may be a few milligrams traces\" of explosives at his home address. She said the device was made from the volatile chemical explosive TATP and contained 2.2kg of sockets, screws, bolts, nails, knives and screwdrivers. Jurors were told that Mr Hassan had arrived in Britain in the back of a lorry via the Channel Tunnel in October 2015. He told authorities he was born in June 1999 in Iraq, but had no identity documents. He gave his name as Ahmed Hassan Mohammed Ali. He claimed asylum, and from 2016 lived with foster parents in Cavendish Road, Sunbury in Surrey. At the time he allegedly planned his attack, his asylum claim was still outstanding, the court heard. SD card\nThe court heard that on the day of the attack Mr Hassan left his home shortly before 7am and took the train from Sunbury to Wimbledon. In a toilet on the concourse, he set the timer on the device before boarding the District Line, four stops from Parsons Green. Ms Morgan told jurors: \"At any point, should he have wanted to, he could have stopped the timer. He could have pulled the wires out of the device. He could have stopped the detonation. \"The CCTV footage from inside the carriage shows that at no stage did the defendant reach inside the bag to do anything.\" The court heard that after \"calmly\" walking away from Putney Bridge station, Mr Hassan boarded a bus towards Earl's Court where sat on the top deck at the front. CCTV footage allegedly shows him glancing out of the window as he passes Parsons Green station. He is seen to remove the SD card from his mobile phone, chew on it and stuff it down the side of the bus seat, where it was later discovered by police in a destroyed state. Mr Hassan bought a backpack and clothes and was seen on CCTV at Ashford, wearing a blue Chelsea football shirt, the court heard. He boarded a train and arrived at Dover at around 14.30 BST where he is said to have bought a mobile phone and viewed the BBC News website which showed images of the scene he had left behind at Parsons Green.

        "content": "Two lorry drivers - one twice over the legal alcohol limit and the other on a hands-free call - will be sentenced for causing the deaths of eight people on the M1. As the trial concludes, the wife and children of the minibus driver killed in the crash speak of their grief. On 25 August, Cyriac Joseph's evening started like many others had before. The 52-year-old driver was transporting a group of tourists in his minibus. Business had been good and Mr Joseph, known as Benny to his friends, was looking to acquire another coach for ABC Travels, the company he had set up in 2013. He lived in Sherwood, Nottingham, with his wife of 22 years, Ancy. The couple had two children; a son, Benson and a daughter, Benita. \"People looked up to him,\" said Benson, now a first-year university student. \"If they wanted to know something they would come to our house or they would call him up. I always saw my dad busy on the phone speaking to, advising someone, on any topic.\" The good-humoured Mr Joseph, once the president of Nottingham Malayalee Cultural Association, called everyone his friend, according to 16-year-old Benita. That all changed over the sweltering August Bank Holiday weekend. Mr Joseph was taking a group of 11 Indian visitors from Nottingham to London to catch a coach to Disneyland Paris. Shortly after 03:00 BST, he was on the M1 near Newport Pagnell when he came across the lorry of Ryszard Masierak, which was parked in the inside line despite the hard shoulder being available. Mr Joseph pulled up his minibus with his hazard lights on waiting to go around the lorry, in which it transpired Masierak was sleeping. Behind him was David Wagstaff driving his Fed Ex lorry. Wagstaff had 250 yards - between nine and 11 seconds - to see the minibus. He did not. Wagstaff's lorry ploughed into the minibus without braking or swerving, forcing it underneath Masierak's vehicle. Eight of the 12 minibus occupants died. Five men and two women from Kerala in southern India, whose ages ranged from their mid 20s to their early 60s, were killed, along with Mr Joseph. The four other people in the minibus - including a four-year-old girl left orphaned by the tragedy - spent weeks in hospital following the crash. The court heard Wagstaff, who had been speaking to his friend on the phone at the time of the crash, admitted to officers at the scene: \"The collision is my fault. I hit the back of all of them.\" He later seemingly accepted his fate in hospital: \"I know I'm going to prison, I have seen it happen enough.\" Wagstaff was cleared of causing death by dangerous driving but admitted eight counts of causing death by careless driving. Masierak, on the other hand, tried to fool the police by pretending not to be the driver. He was found sitting between the passenger and driver's seats. A taxi driver, Ali Alias, was one of the first on the scene and could smell alcohol on the Polish national. When he asked Masierak if he was OK, he responded, \"Can I go?\". Mathew John, a spokesman for the Joseph family, said they were upset by how AIM Logistics driver Masierak had conducted himself throughout the case. Mr John said: \"Obviously these things could happen any time to anybody and sometimes when something happens, when something goes wrong, it's how you react to that. \"Myself and Ancy were in the court every day. He lied about everything, so we feel angry, and he doesn't feel any sense of guilt or think he has done anything wrong even though his action has killed eight people.\" During the trial at Reading Crown Court, Masierak claimed he was a \"careful driver\", but the jury heard he had had a ticket for driving his lorry in the outside lane and for jumping a red light. He also admitted consuming alcohol but said this was not a factor in the accident. He claimed the reason he stopped his lorry was because he was sweating, felt weak and had a headache - something he did not mention at the police station after the crash. \"Ryszard Masierak is a liar,\" said Oliver Saxby QC, when summing up for the prosecution. \"He drove as dangerously as is possible. He was drunk. He was driving erratically and his driving fell far below the standard [of lawful driving].\" While Masierak did not have a clean record, Wagstaff did. He had been a professional driver for 28 years, a job that he loved, according to his wife Patricia. Mrs Wagstaff told the court she first heard of the events at 03:15 when her \"lovely, caring husband and a brilliant father\" to their son, Peter, made a short call to tell her he had been involved in an accident and it was bad. \"He sounded really flustered and said he would not be home soon,\" she said. Since the accident, Wagstaff, from Stoke-on-Trent, has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. He told the court he has \"vivid memories\" of the bodies after the crash. He said he \"cannot remember anything at all\" about the collision and said what happened was down to a \"lack of concentration\". \"Obviously there were a lot of other vehicles that managed to pass after Mr Masierak's lorry was there and that is because they paid attention on the road,\" said Mr John. \"We understand that he put his hands up straight away, but we still think that, if he had managed to stop the lorry, the seriousness of the collision would have been much less. \"So we feel sympathy for the family but we still feel angry.\" The impact of the crash is still keenly felt in the Joseph household. \"I wish I had more time with him,\" said A-level student Benita. \"It was hard and it still is but I'm grateful for my friends' support, my school and everyone. \"And, I don't know how to put it into words, it's just you can never prepare for something like this but I'm trying my best - we all are. We're sticking together, we're going through this together.\" For Ancy, the pain is almost too raw to bear. \"I loved him very much. He loved me. He was a very good husband - I lost everything,\" she said. \"It's a big tragedy, a big loss. I'm empty now. [I have] nothing in my brain also. Everything is gone. \"There is no life for me now. My life is finished.\" ",

        "content": "A second lorry driver involved in a crash on the M1 that killed eight people has been cleared of causing death by dangerous driving. David Wagstaff had previously admitted eight counts of the lesser charge of causing death by careless driving. Wagstaff, 54, was on a hands-free call when his lorry forced a minibus under a stationary lorry in lane one. The driver of the other lorry involved, Ryszard Masierak, 31, was convicted on Tuesday of dangerous driving charges. The pair are due to be sentenced at Aylesbury Crown Court on 23 March. Ch Insp Andy Storey, from Thames Valley Police, revealed outside court that Masierak's professional driving licence had been revoked prior to the crash and he \"should not have been driving at all that day\". Fed Ex driver Wagstaff, who described his own actions as a \"lack of concentration\", was also cleared of four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving by the jury at Reading Crown Court, charges that Masierak had also been found guilty of. Judge Francis Sheridan paid tribute to the jury in what he described as a \"very emotional and heartbreaking\" case. Louise Atrill, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said outside court: \"Both men showed flagrant disregard for the safety of other road users that morning, leaving five families mourning their loved ones. \"It's unimaginable to think of the consequences this incident will have on the family and friends of the deceased and those injured.\" Mathew John, spokesman for the family of minibus driver Mr Joseph, said they were disappointed by the verdict on Wagstaff. He added: \"Cyriac Joseph's family lost a great father, loving husband and a very good friend.\" The court heard AIM Logistics driver Masierak was at twice the drink-drive limit when he stopped his vehicle in the carriageway near Newport Pagnell, on 26 August last year. Just after 03:00 BST, a minibus being driven by Cyriac Joseph carrying 11 Indian tourists from Nottingham to London on their way to Disneyland Paris pulled up behind Masierak's vehicle with its hazard lights on, waiting to go around it. 'Memories of bodies'\nSeconds later Wagstaff, who had been on a hands-free call for an hour, ploughed into the back of the minibus, without swerving or braking, and forced it into and under Masierak's vehicle, the court heard. Wagstaff, of Derwent Street, Stoke-on-Trent, told police he spoke to fellow driver Elliot Brough frequently and on the night in question they were talking about \"rubbish\", including Everton and Donald Trump. During the trial, Wagstaff, who has since been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, said he \"cannot remember anything at all\" about the collision. His lawyer said he had \"vivid memories\" of the bodies in the aftermath of the crash over the August Bank Holiday weekend. The eight people killed - six men and two women - were Mr Joseph, Panneerselvam Annamalai, Rishi Ranjeev Kumar, Vivek Baskaran, Lavanyalakshmi Seetharaman, Karthikeyan Pugalur Ramasubramanian, Subramaniyan Arachelvan and Tamilmani Arachelvan. The four other people in the minibus - including a four-year-old girl left orphaned by the tragedy - spent weeks in hospital following the crash. The court was told AIM Logistics driver Masierak stopped in the carriageway at about 02:57 BST, despite there being miles of hard shoulder available. Prosecutor Oliver Saxby QC called the Polish national's behaviour \"as flagrant as it was dangerous\". He admitted he had consumed alcohol but said this had nothing to do with the crash. Instead, he said he stopped because he was sweating, felt weak and had a headache and had attempted to get onto the hard shoulder. Masierak, of Barnards Close, Evesham, Worcestershire, then said he lost consciousness, only to be woken from what he described as a \"small coma\" when the crash happened. After Wagstaff's verdict was given, Judge Francis Sheridan praised the families of the deceased for their \"constant dignity in a dreadful case with very sad, tragic consequences\". ",

        "content": "Save the Children \"failed\" to adequately deal with allegations against its ex-chief executive Justin Forsyth, according to leaked documents. A 2015 report seen by the BBC contains evidence suggesting then chairman Sir Alan Parker's \"very close\" relationship with Mr Forsyth may have affected how he responded to complaints. Three women employees accused Mr Forsyth of inappropriate behaviour, for which he said he had apologised. Sir Alan said he had nothing to add. Meanwhile a leaked email from the time suggested Mr Forsyth should not be alone with female employees. Mr Forsyth said that he had taken \"responsibility\" for his mistakes, but did \"not accept as accurate some recent media reports on the details of the complaints\". Save the Children UK said a new review of workplace ethics would ensure that what caused previous claimants hurt \"cannot be repeated\". It said the charity's \"new leadership\" and its trustees are \"committed to respect in the workplace\". Ethics expert Dr Suzanne Shale, who is leading a new independent review for the charity, said she \"acknowledges that past events may have caused distress to staff, and disquiet amongst those who support the work of the charity. We will listen to those accounts very carefully and with utmost consideration\". On Tuesday, protesters from the Women's Equality Party interrupted a Save the Children board meeting with Sir Alan, to call for his resignation. End of Youtube post by Women's Equality Channel Alexia Pepper de Caires, a former Save the Children employee and Women's Equality Party member, was invited to meet the board on Wednesday following the protest. \"The board now has the information it needs to make decisions on the future of (Sir Alan's) leadership,\" she said. Last month, the BBC revealed Mr Forsyth faced three complaints of inappropriate behaviour towards female staff before leaving Save the Children in 2015. Days later, Mr Forsyth resigned from his role as deputy director of UNICEF, saying he did not want coverage of his past to \"damage\" the charities. Now a report leaked to Radio 4's PM programme, which has never been made public by the charity, exposes failures in how these complaints were handled. In it, a complainant claims Save the Children told her not to tell anyone about her case and that both her and Mr Forsyth's reputations were at risk. \"They weren't trying to protect me or safeguard any other women. It was just about covering this up as quickly as they could,\" she said. The report - by law firm Lewis Silkin - was commissioned as part of a review of how Save the Children had handled complaints of inappropriate behaviour. It was written in October 2015. Months later, Save the Children provided a reference for Mr Forsyth when he applied for a job at UNICEF, which made no mention of the complaints. In a separate leaked email in 2015, a senior staff member said that allegations of sexual harassment made against Mr Forsyth were \"not being treated with the appropriate degree of seriousness\" and that \"he should not be unaccompanied with female members of staff\" until they could be sure his behaviour would not be repeated. The senior staff member wrote that that they had no confidence in Sir Alan Parker's handling of the complaints, saying he had \"made a deliberate choice\u2026not to fully investigate these allegations\" and as a result had a \"conflict of interest\" in relation to the review. Who is Sir Alan Parker?\nAs well as being the international chairman of Save the Children, Sir Alan is the founder and chairman of the PR firm Brunswick and counts former prime ministers among his friends. Gordon Brown is godfather to his youngest son, and when David Cameron left Number 10, it was Sir Alan's west London mansion that became the Camerons' temporary home. More than 240 people have signed a petition calling for Sir Alan, who was chair of Save the Children UK at the time of the complaints against Mr Forsyth, to be held accountable and removed from his current role. The petition claims \"his abuse of that power to dampen the situation is widely known\" and signatories include current and former Save the Children staff. The complaints against Justin Forsyth:\nThe first case was reported in 2012. The victim described receiving numerous inappropriate text messages from Mr Forsyth, who was her boss. When she made it clear to Mr Forsyth that these texts were unwelcome and made her feel uncomfortable, he persisted in sending them. When she complained again, she alleges that he took her phone when he saw it had been left on her desk and deleted some of the texts. She then lodged an official complaint. The head of HR at the time is quoted in the report as saying: \"I thought the deleting of the texts was intimidating.\" Because Save The Children never formally questioned Mr Forsyth about the allegations, the report does not reflect his account of events. His lawyers say he categorically denies that he deleted any texts. The report is clear that a disciplinary investigation should have been held but states: \"no adequate investigation took place\". 'So scared'\nInstead, Sir Alan instructed a trustee to meet the complainant for a chat. In the evidence, the trustee claims that Sir Alan briefed him in advance that he believed she may have \"overreacted\". The complainant for her part described feeling \"just so scared\" when she would see Mr Forsyth. Sir Alan wrote a formal warning to Mr Forsyth. This letter no longer exists although the report says it should have remained on Mr Forsyth's record. A draft of that letter in the report warned that \"this type of conduct can amount to unlawful harassment\". In the report, Mr Forsyth insists the complaint was dealt with appropriately, adding that he had given up his bonus - worth \u00a320,000 - that year. Sir Alan was on the Performance and Remuneration Committee that awarded that bonus in 2012. The complainant said she was assured the formal warning would remain on Mr Forsyth's record and that \"if this ever happened again, Alan will walk (Mr Forsyth) out of the door.\" Both failed to happen and in 2015, two more women came forward with complaints. The second complainant was an employee who would often go on business trips with Mr Forsyth to where Save the Children operated in the field. During these trips, according to the leaked report, she received late night text messages from him, complimenting her on her work performance and asking her out for a drink. She declined but - according to her - the messages became \"more demanding\". Between trips, Mr Forsyth invited her for \"career chats\" after work. On one occasion, Mr Forsyth is alleged to have said: \"Look, I fancy you, you fancy me. Why don't we just stop pretending?\" She says she made it clear she wasn't interested and subsequently made excuses to avoid business trips with him. He sent her emails asking if she was avoiding him and she said that since then, she felt marginalised at work. The third complainant's account set out in the report describes how one night on a business trip \"they continued their work discussion, stopping outside (Mr Forsyth's) room... and (he) invited her into his room for a glass of wine. \"She sat on the table and he invited her to sit on the bed. She declined. She went to the bathroom and when she returned, he was reclining on his bed.\" On another evening, Mr Forsyth is alleged to have announced he was \"not CEO for the night\" and asked her about her love life. He began to talk about his sex life and told her she was \"beautiful and talented\". The complainant says she made it clear she was not interested and refused his advances. In a statement issued by his legal representatives, Mr Forsyth admitted \"personal mistakes during my time at Save The Children\". \"I recognise that on a few occasions I had unsuitable and thoughtless conversations with colleagues, which I subsequently discovered caused offence and hurt,\" he said. \"When this was brought to my attention on two separate occasions, I apologised unreservedly to the three colleagues involved. The concerns were handled through a process of mediation.\" 'People behave differently abroad'\nAfter the two later complaints, Save the Children's head of HR alerted Sir Alan, but evidence in the report shows he claimed he received a \"less than supportive response\". Recalling a conversation with Sir Alan, he said it was \"along the lines of 'Justin Forsyth is very important to the organisation; people behave differently when they're abroad; they would have been tired; they would have needed some mutual support; what were the complainants doing by agreeing to go to his hotel room in the first place.\" The account goes on to record that the head of HR was \"frustrated\" by Sir Alan's response, \"which he feared was as a result of Sir Alan Parker and Justin Forsyth being very close\". One complainant is quoted in the report saying: \"It's more about who Alan is and having Alan and his best mate Justin sort of talking to each other about how best to handle these girls.\" According to the report, Sir Alan said he didn't think there had been any \"serious misconduct\" or \"predatory behaviour\". He also rejected suggestions there should be any work done to look at the \"leadership culture\" at Save the Children in light of these complaints and \"generalised complaints of sexual advances and bullying\" by Brendan Cox, the widower of the MP Jo Cox, who was accused of sexual assault by a member of staff at the charity a couple of months later. Mr Cox says he does not accept the allegations, but acknowledges he \"made mistakes\" while working for Save the Children. Sir Alan is described as saying, \"the best way to protect the organisation from reputational risk is not to let the organisational response become disproportionate\". ",

        "content": "Chilean actress Daniela Vega made history by becoming the first transgender presenter at the Oscars ceremony. But, at a news conference after meeting Chile's President Michelle Bachelet this week, she spoke of the inequalities transgender people face in her home country. Vega said that, in Chile, \"I have a name on my identity card that is not my name\". \"In the country where I was born I do not have the possibility of having my own name on my official documents,\" the A Fantastic Woman star said. \"The clock is running, time is passing, people are awaiting this change.\" A gender identity bill - which would allow trans people to identify themselves with their preferred names rather than their assigned ones - is currently being considered by a congressional committee. But its future is uncertain as Chile is about to have a new administration under conservative former President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, who takes over from Ms Bachelet on 11 March. 'Great ambassador'\nA Fantastic Woman, in which Vega plays an opera singer grieving over the death of her lover while being rejected by his family, won best foreign film at the Oscars - a first in this category for Chile. The film's director Sebasti\u00e1n Lelio told the same news conference that they and Ms Bachelet had spoken about the \"urgency\" of putting in place a law on gender identity. He described his lead actress, who was originally only hired as a consultant on the film, as \"a great ambassador between the film and reality\". And he said: \"Cinema has the power to be able to come out of the screen and enter social consciousness.\" For her part, Daniela Vega said that the film \"talk[s] about the limits of empathy and who places barriers in the way of trans people.\" \"Trans people have existed since the first day of humanity,\" Vega said, adding that acceptance by society is a significant problem.

        "content": "The man accused of the Parsons Green Tube bombing told officials months before the attack that he had been \"trained to kill\", a court has heard. Jurors heard that asylum seeker Ahmed Hassan spoke to Home Office officials in January 2016 - 20 months before the bombing that injured 30 people. In an interview, Mr Hassan said he had been taken by force by the Islamic State group in Iraq and given training. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. The Old Bailey jury heard that Mr Hassan originally told police he was responsible for the bombing. They also heard graphic descriptions by victims of the explosion on the District Line on 15 September, 2017. One spoke of \"a furnace engulfed in flames\" when the device - made with materials partly sourced from Asda and Aldi - exploded at Parsons Green station during London's rush hour. Alison Morgan, prosecuting, told jurors that during a Home Office immigration interview in Croydon in January 2016, Mr Hassan was asked if he was, or had been part of a terror group in Iraq before he sought asylum in the UK. The jury heard he told officials that he had been taken by force by Isis (the Islamic State group), who had threatened to kill his uncle and brother if he resisted. Asked in the Home Office interview whether he had had any training from the Islamic State group Mr Hassan allegedly said: \"They trained us on how to kill. It was all religious based\". But he denied the Islamic State group had sent him to Europe to work for them. The court also heard that a worker for the charity Barnardos, who spoke Arabic, allegedly caught him listening to a \"call-to-arms\" song. The lyrics translated as: \"We are coming with you to the slaughter in your home/country.\" 'Fear and panic'\nDescribing the attack on 15 September, one passenger, Aimee Colville, spoke of \"shards of glass flying through the air and then flames\". Jurors heard she could \"smell herself burning and saw her hair was on fire\". Thirty people were injured in the incident: some badly burned and others injured in the \"stampede\" as they fled in fear and panic, the Old Bailey was told. Alison Morgan, prosecuting, told the jurors that Mr Hassan packed a bomb with screwdrivers, knives and nails to cause \"maximum carnage\" on the rush-hour Tube. Jurors heard he bought metal items from Asda and Aldi supermarkets the day before the bombing. The court heard how Mr Hassan also researched the ingredients for TATP explosives and bought sulphuric acid on Amazon. To avoid suspicion, he allegedly used a friend's address for the delivery of the largest component - hydrogen peroxide. The device, which was on a timer, partially exploded very shortly after the crowded train arrived at Parsons Green Station during rush hour. Ms Morgan said: \"There were approximately 93 people in the carriage when the device detonated. \"The partial explosion created a large fireball. Some in the carriage were caught by the flames and sustained significant burns. \"Many ran in fear and panic. They were fortunate. Had the device fully detonated, it is inevitable that serious injury and significant damage would have been caused within the carriage.\" The court heard that, after the explosion, hundreds of people in the station tried to escape down a narrow staircase. Asylum seeker\nMr Hassan had got off the carriage at Putney Bridge Station before the bomb went off. He was arrested at the Port of Dover the next day. Ms Morgan told the jury that when first arrested and questioned by police, Mr Hassan accepted that he was \"responsible for the device\" and told them there \"may be a few milligrams traces\" of explosives at his home address. She said the device was made from the volatile chemical explosive TATP and contained 2.2kg of sockets, screws, bolts, nails, knives and screwdrivers. Jurors were told that Mr Hassan had arrived in Britain in the back of a lorry via the Channel Tunnel in October 2015. He told authorities he was born in June 1999 in Iraq, but had no identity documents. He gave his name as Ahmed Hassan Mohammed Ali. He claimed asylum, and from 2016 lived with foster parents in Cavendish Road, Sunbury in Surrey. At the time he allegedly planned his attack, his asylum claim was still outstanding, the court heard. SD card\nThe court heard that on the day of the attack Mr Hassan left his home shortly before 7am and took the train from Sunbury to Wimbledon. In a toilet on the concourse, he set the timer on the device before boarding the District Line, four stops from Parsons Green. Ms Morgan told jurors: \"At any point, should he have wanted to, he could have stopped the timer. He could have pulled the wires out of the device. He could have stopped the detonation. \"The CCTV footage from inside the carriage shows that at no stage did the defendant reach inside the bag to do anything.\" The court heard that after \"calmly\" walking away from Putney Bridge station, Mr Hassan boarded a bus towards Earl's Court where sat on the top deck at the front. CCTV footage allegedly shows him glancing out of the window as he passes Parsons Green station. He is seen to remove the SD card from his mobile phone, chew on it and stuff it down the side of the bus seat, where it was later discovered by police in a destroyed state. Mr Hassan bought a backpack and clothes and was seen on CCTV at Ashford, wearing a blue Chelsea football shirt, the court heard. He boarded a train and arrived at Dover at around 14.30 BST where he is said to have bought a mobile phone and viewed the BBC News website which showed images of the scene he had left behind at Parsons Green.

        "content": "Donald Tusk has insisted the EU \"does not want to build a wall\", but Brexit means \"we will be drifting apart\". The EU Council president said Theresa May wanted to \"demonstrate at any price that Brexit could be a success\", but that was not the EU's objective. He was unveiling draft guidelines for the EU side of Brexit trade talks. Mr Tusk said the EU wanted an \"ambitious and advanced\" free trade deal - and continued access to UK waters for EU fishing vessels. \"Our agreement will not make trade between the UK and EU frictionless or smoother,\" he said. \"It will make it more complicated and costly than today for all of us. This is the essence of Brexit.\" He said it would be the first time in history that a free trade agreement would \"loosen, not strengthen, economic ties\". Donald Tusk doesn't share Theresa May's objective\nWhat the EU wants\nThe draft European Council guidelines call for zero-tariff trade in goods - where the EU has a surplus. The document also says access for services will be limited by the fact that the UK will be outside the EU and will no longer share a common regulatory and judiciary framework. The draft guidelines repeat EU warnings that there can be \"no cherry-picking\" of participation in the single market for particular sectors of industry. Mr Tusk said he wanted continued security and research cooperation and to ensure flights were not grounded. But he added: \"No member state is free to pick only those sectors of the internal market they like, or to accept the role of the ECJ only when it suits their interest.\" The draft guidelines also say that the EU will \"preserve its autonomy as regards its decision-making, which excludes participation of the United Kingdom as a third-country to EU Institutions, agencies or bodies\". What the UK wants\nMrs May acknowledged in her Mansion House speech on Brexit on Friday that neither side would get everything they want from negotiations. But she also stressed that the UK wanted a bespoke trade deal, rather than an \"off-the-shelf\" model. \"The fact is that every free trade agreement has varying market access depending on the respective interests of the countries involved,\" she said. \"If this is cherry-picking, then every trade arrangement is cherry-picking.\" She also said: \"We will also want to explore with the EU, the terms on which the UK could remain part of EU agencies.\" This appears to be in conflict with the EU draft guidelines, although BBC Research has found several examples of non-EU members participating - as a member or observer - in EU agencies and bodies, such as the European Environment Agency and the European Medicines Agency. What about fishing rights?\nThe EU says it wants to maintain \"existing reciprocal access to fishing waters\" - a leading concern of the fishing industry in countries bordering the North Sea. In her Mansion House speech, Mrs May said: \"The UK will regain control over our domestic fisheries management rules and access to our waters.\" She added that the UK would want to \"work together to manage shared stocks in a sustainable way and to agree reciprocal access to waters and a fairer allocation of fishing opportunities for the UK fishing industry\". Brexit Secretary David Davis - quizzed on Tuesday by Brexiteer Labour MP Kate Hoey - insisted the government would not betray UK fishing communities by \"trading away fishing rights\" for \"other things\". Asked about the EU's demand to keep access as it is now, Chancellor Philip Hammond said the UK was \"open to discussing with our EU partners about the appropriate arrangements for reciprocal access for our fishermen to EU waters and for EU fishermen to our waters\". Campaign group Fishing for Leave urged the government not to \"cave in\" to the EU demands, saying: \"Nowhere else is access to fisheries included as negotiating collateral for a free trade agreement.\" What about financial services?\nFinancial services is not mentioned specifically in the EU draft guidelines, but it is shaping up to be a major sticking point. UK Chancellor Philip Hammond has told European leaders that it is in the \"mutual interest\" of both the UK and the EU to include financial services in a free trade agreement. \"Given the shape of the British economy and our trade balance with the EU 27, it's hard to see how any deal that did not include services could look like a fair and balanced settlement,\" he said in a speech. \"Not only is it possible to include financial services in a trade deal, but this is very much in our mutual interest to do so.\" But Donald Tusk appeared to reject the UK proposals. The EU says the UK will be treated like any other \"third country\" after Brexit. Asked about the EU guidelines, which also warn of the \"negative economic consequences\" of Brexit, Mr Hammond said: \"It does not surprise me remotely that what they have set out this morning is a very tough position. That's what any competent, skilled and experienced negotiator would do.\" EU deal 'must include financial services' Analysis by BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming\nDonald Tusk unveiled his guidelines in a picture-perfect castle in the hills outside Luxembourg. A nice change to the usual venues in Brussels but the same tough message from the EU that the UK's red lines limit what it can get from the final Brexit deal. The best that's on offer is a free trade agreement on goods with no tariffs, and access to the European markets for the UK service sector - but under EU rules and with no specific mention of financial services. I asked a sad-sounding Donald Tusk if his offer came anywhere close to what the prime minister had asked for in her Mansion House speech. His pause was epically long, which suggested he knows it is not. His document is also pretty gloomy, with a spine-chilling warning about the economic costs to the UK. But there is also a big offer tucked away in a later paragraph - there are other options available if the government is prepared to compromise on its red lines. What happens now?\nThe leaders of the remaining 27 EU states must approve the plans at a Brussels summit on 22 March, setting the template for chief negotiator Michel Barnier for talks with the UK about their future relationship. The UK is due to leave the EU at the end of March 2019, and both sides have said they would like a deal on their future relationship to be agreed by this autumn to allow time for parliaments to approve the deal before Brexit happens. But the European Council \"confirms its readiness to initiate work towards a free trade agreement (FTA), to be finalised and concluded once the UK is no longer a member state\". The European Parliament has its say\nThe European Parliament has stressed that its preferred option is for the UK to continue to be a member of the single market and customs union after Brexit, in a draft resolution, leaked to the Politico website. The parliament does not have a formal role in the Brexit negotiations but does have a veto on the final deal. The European Parliament document, which may be changed before it is adopted, says non-EU members - even if very closely aligned to the bloc - cannot expect the same rights and benefits as EU members. It also warns that the UK's current \"red lines\" in Brexit talks \"would lead to customs checks and verification which would affect global supply chains and manufacturing processes, even if tariff barriers can be avoided\". It says a \"deep and comprehensive\" trade deal, of the kind envisioned by Theresa May, must entail \"a binding interpretation role\" for the European Court of Justice. EU citizenship debate\nMPs in Westminster are, meanwhile, debating a call by Plaid Cymru - who have four MPs in Wales - for UK nationals to be allowed to keep their EU citizenship after Brexit. Plaid said EU citizenship would give holders the right to travel, live, study and work anywhere in the EU even after the UK leaves next year. A UK government spokesman said only citizens of EU member states could hold EU citizenship. ",

        "content": "A second lorry driver involved in a crash on the M1 that killed eight people has been cleared of causing death by dangerous driving. David Wagstaff had previously admitted eight counts of the lesser charge of causing death by careless driving. Wagstaff, 54, was on a hands-free call when his lorry forced a minibus under a stationary lorry in lane one. The driver of the other lorry involved, Ryszard Masierak, 31, was convicted on Tuesday of dangerous driving charges. The pair are due to be sentenced at Aylesbury Crown Court on 23 March. Ch Insp Andy Storey, from Thames Valley Police, revealed outside court that Masierak's professional driving licence had been revoked prior to the crash and he \"should not have been driving at all that day\". Fed Ex driver Wagstaff, who described his own actions as a \"lack of concentration\", was also cleared of four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving by the jury at Reading Crown Court, charges that Masierak had also been found guilty of. Judge Francis Sheridan paid tribute to the jury in what he described as a \"very emotional and heartbreaking\" case. Louise Atrill, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said outside court: \"Both men showed flagrant disregard for the safety of other road users that morning, leaving five families mourning their loved ones. \"It's unimaginable to think of the consequences this incident will have on the family and friends of the deceased and those injured.\" Mathew John, spokesman for the family of minibus driver Mr Joseph, said they were disappointed by the verdict on Wagstaff. He said motorway information systems had failed to alert other road users to the fact Masierak had been stationary for more than 10 minutes. \"I think there should [also] be monitoring cameras in the [lorry] cabin to see what actually these drivers are doing,\" he added. The court heard AIM Logistics driver Masierak was at twice the drink-drive limit when he stopped his vehicle in the carriageway near Newport Pagnell, on 26 August last year. Just after 03:00 BST, a minibus being driven by Cyriac Joseph carrying 11 Indian tourists from Nottingham to London on their way to Disneyland Paris pulled up behind Masierak's vehicle with its hazard lights on, waiting to go around it. 'Memories of bodies'\nSeconds later Wagstaff, who had been on a hands-free call for an hour, ploughed into the back of the minibus, without swerving or braking, and forced it into and under Masierak's vehicle, the court heard. Wagstaff, of Derwent Street, Stoke-on-Trent, told police he spoke to fellow driver Elliot Brough frequently and on the night in question they were talking about \"rubbish\", including Everton and Donald Trump. During the trial, Wagstaff, who has since been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, said he \"cannot remember anything at all\" about the collision. His lawyer said he had \"vivid memories\" of the bodies in the aftermath of the crash over the August Bank Holiday weekend. The eight people killed - six men and two women - were Mr Joseph, Panneerselvam Annamalai, Rishi Ranjeev Kumar, Vivek Baskaran, Lavanyalakshmi Seetharaman, Karthikeyan Pugalur Ramasubramanian, Subramaniyan Arachelvan and Tamilmani Arachelvan. The four other people in the minibus - including a four-year-old girl left orphaned by the tragedy - spent weeks in hospital following the crash. The court was told AIM Logistics driver Masierak stopped in the carriageway at about 02:57 BST, despite there being miles of hard shoulder available. Prosecutor Oliver Saxby QC called the Polish national's behaviour \"as flagrant as it was dangerous\". He admitted he had consumed alcohol but said this had nothing to do with the crash. Instead, he said he stopped because he was sweating, felt weak and had a headache and had attempted to get onto the hard shoulder. Masierak, of Barnards Close, Evesham, Worcestershire, then said he lost consciousness, only to be woken from what he described as a \"small coma\" when the crash happened. After Wagstaff's verdict was given, Judge Francis Sheridan praised the families of the deceased for their \"constant dignity in a dreadful case with very sad, tragic consequences\". ",

        "content": "Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo and Mercedes Lewis Hamilton set the pace on day two of the final pre-season test as McLaren suffered more problems. Ricciardo edged out Hamilton by 0.353 seconds for fastest time, but the Mercedes was substantially quicker when the cars were on equivalent tyres. Fernando Alonso was delayed for nearly seven hours after his McLaren broke down because of an oil leak. It was the latest in a series of reliability problems for the team. Alonso managed less than a third of the laps done during the day by Ricciardo and the Mercedes and Renault drivers. Alonso did 47 laps in the morning before stopping out on track after just over two hours of the day's running. The team said they would get him out later in the day - but managed to do so with only 13 minutes to go. He was on track for only eight minutes before the day was brought to a premature end when rookie Charles Leclerc went off in the Sauber. Alonso's problems made it the fourth of six days of pre-season testing so far on which McLaren have lost significant track time as a result of technical issues. The team are hoping to be close to the front this season following their switch to Renault engines following three difficult years with Honda. McLaren racing director Eric Boullier insisted the team were on track, and that they were simply suffering the sort of niggles that can be expected in pre-season. \"We have some little issues which we have to fix, but it is just testing. It is part of the process,\" Boullier said. \"We are on top of this and it is a new partnership with Renault, new packaging, completely new packaging for the car as well. This is testing, give us time - it is fine.\" McLaren are not yet close to achieving the main ambition set by Boullier for this week of completing a race distance. Alonso, who has said he expects his team to be able to challenge for podium positions this season, is due to speak to the media this evening. The 36-year-old two-time champion did set the fifth fastest time of the day, but he was using the 'hyper-soft' tyre and was 1.8secs behind Ricciardo's pace-setting best on the same rubber. Hamilton did not use the hyper-soft tyre, although his team-mate Valtteri Bottas did after taking over the Mercedes for the afternoon session, and was 0.6secs slower than Ricciardo on it. Hamilton was 0.5secs quicker than Ricciardo on the ultra-soft tyre, and 0.8secs ahead on the medium tyre. The times are not necessarily directly comparable because the fuel loads and engine modes being used by the car are not made public by the teams and can make a significant different to performance. The fastest Ferrari time was set by Sebastian Vettel, who was fourth overall with a 1:19.541 on the soft tyre, which all the drivers are saying is more or less the same in performance as the medium at Barcelona. Carlos Sainz was sixth fastest in the factory Renault car - less than 0.2secs behind Alonso but using the medium tyre, which is well over a second slower than the hyper-soft.

        "content": "The man accused of the Parsons Green Tube bombing told officials months before the attack that he had been \"trained to kill\", a court has heard. Jurors heard that asylum seeker Ahmed Hassan spoke to Home Office officials in January 2016 - 20 months before the bombing that injured 30 people. In an interview, Mr Hassan said he had been taken by force by the Islamic State group in Iraq and given training. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. The Old Bailey jury heard that Mr Hassan originally told police he was responsible for the bombing. They also heard graphic descriptions by victims of the explosion on the District Line on 15 September, 2017. One spoke of \"a furnace engulfed in flames\" when the device - made with materials partly sourced from Asda and Aldi - exploded at Parsons Green station during London's rush hour. Alison Morgan, prosecuting, told jurors that during a Home Office immigration interview in Croydon in January 2016, Mr Hassan was asked if he was, or had been part of a terror group in Iraq before he sought asylum in the UK. The jury heard he told officials that he had been taken by force by Isis (the Islamic State group), who had threatened to kill his uncle and brother if he resisted. Asked in the Home Office interview whether he had had any training from the Islamic State group Mr Hassan allegedly said: \"They trained us on how to kill. It was all religious based\". But he denied the Islamic State group had sent him to Europe to work for them. The court also heard that a worker for the charity Barnardos, who spoke Arabic, allegedly caught him listening to a \"call-to-arms\" song. The lyrics translated as: \"We are coming with you to the slaughter in your home/country.\" 'Fear and panic'\nDescribing the attack on 15 September, one passenger, Aimee Colville, spoke of \"shards of glass flying through the air and then flames\". Jurors heard she could \"smell herself burning and saw her hair was on fire\". Thirty people were injured in the incident: some badly burned and others injured in the \"stampede\" as they fled in fear and panic, the Old Bailey was told. Alison Morgan, prosecuting, told the jurors that Mr Hassan packed a bomb with screwdrivers, knives and nails to cause \"maximum carnage\" on the rush-hour Tube. Jurors heard he bought metal items from Asda and Aldi supermarkets the day before the bombing. The court heard how Mr Hassan also researched the ingredients for TATP explosives and bought sulphuric acid on Amazon. To avoid suspicion, he allegedly used a friend's address for the delivery of the largest component - hydrogen peroxide. The device, which was on a timer, partially exploded very shortly after the crowded train arrived at Parsons Green Station during rush hour. Ms Morgan said: \"There were approximately 93 people in the carriage when the device detonated. \"The partial explosion created a large fireball. Some in the carriage were caught by the flames and sustained significant burns. \"Many ran in fear and panic. They were fortunate. Had the device fully detonated, it is inevitable that serious injury and significant damage would have been caused within the carriage.\" The court heard that, after the explosion, hundreds of people in the station tried to escape down a narrow staircase. Asylum seeker\nMr Hassan had got off the carriage at Putney Bridge Station before the bomb went off. He was arrested at the Port of Dover the next day. Ms Morgan told the jury that when first arrested and questioned by police, Mr Hassan accepted that he was \"responsible for the device\" and told them there \"may be a few milligrams traces\" of explosives at his home address. She said the device was made from the volatile chemical explosive TATP and contained 2.2kg of sockets, screws, bolts, nails, knives and screwdrivers. Jurors were told that Mr Hassan had arrived in Britain in the back of a lorry via the Channel Tunnel in October 2015. He told authorities he was born in June 1999 in Iraq, but had no identity documents. He gave his name as Ahmed Hassan Mohammed Ali. He claimed asylum, and from 2016 lived with foster parents in Cavendish Road, Sunbury in Surrey. At the time he allegedly planned his attack, his asylum claim was still outstanding, the court heard. SD card\nThe court heard that on the day of the attack Mr Hassan left his home shortly before 7am and took the train from Sunbury to Wimbledon. In a toilet on the concourse, he set the timer on the device before boarding the District Line, four stops from Parsons Green. Ms Morgan told jurors: \"At any point, should he have wanted to, he could have stopped the timer. He could have pulled the wires out of the device. He could have stopped the detonation. \"The CCTV footage from inside the carriage shows that at no stage did the defendant reach inside the bag to do anything.\" The court heard that after \"calmly\" walking away from Putney Bridge station, Mr Hassan boarded a bus towards Earl's Court where sat on the top deck at the front. CCTV footage allegedly shows him glancing out of the window as he passes Parsons Green station. He is seen to remove the SD card from his mobile phone, chew on it and stuff it down the side of the bus seat, where it was later discovered by police in a destroyed state. Mr Hassan bought a backpack and clothes and was seen on CCTV at Ashford, wearing a blue Chelsea football shirt, the court heard. He boarded a train and arrived at Dover at around 14.30 BST where he is said to have bought a mobile phone and viewed the BBC News website which showed images of the scene he had left behind at Parsons Green.

        "content": "YouTube has been accused of being either incompetent or irresponsible in its handling of a video promoting a British far-right organisation. The clip features a speech given by the banned Neo-Nazi group, National Action. The chair of the Home Affairs Committee, Yvette Cooper MP, said YouTube had repeatedly promised to block it, only for it to reappear on the platform. YouTube's owner, Google, said it was tackling the problem. \"We do not want National Action content on YouTube and we're getting faster at removing violent extremist content by hiring more people and investing in machine learning technology,\" said a spokesman. \"We're committed to playing our part and being part of the solution on terror.\" YouTube, Facebook and Twitter appeared before the Home Affairs Select Committee in December, when all three were accused of failing to censor National Action propaganda among other illegal hate speech material. Seven complaints\nIn a letter to the company, Ms Cooper wrote that she had flagged a video filmed in 2016 at a National Action demonstration in Darlington \"at least seven times\" with YouTube over the past year. She said she had shown the footage to YouTube's chief executive Susan Wojcicki herself, as well as alerting European public affairs chief Peter Barron and general counsel Kent Walker to the problem. Despite individual instances of the clip being blocked as a result, Ms Cooper said at the time of writing that she was still able to find copies of it on four separate channels. Moreover, she wrote, the \"up next\" section of three of the clips contained another white supremacist video, which was automatically played to the viewer. \"YouTube's continued failure to deal with the same illegal extremist video is a complete disgrace - and shows the shocking lack of effort they have put into the most basic of their social and legal responsibilities,\" Ms Cooper later said. \"If this was a copyright issue they would take it down immediately and automatically, and would invest in the technology to sort it out. \"We have raised this repeatedly at the most senior level so their executives cannot pretend not to know how serious this is. \"If they are too arrogant to act on illegal material when they are warned repeatedly, it's time to bring in a system of strong fines as the committee recommended last year.\" The latest four examples presented by Ms Cooper have now been blocked. The BBC was able to find a separate video with similar content that had been online since January, which has since been removed as well. \"I managed to see it just before it was taken down and while we don't think it was 100% identical, we're pretty sure it was the same voiceover with different images,\" said George Perry, a press officer to the select committee. The letter comes a week after the European Commission recommended that YouTube and other social networks be required to remove terrorist content within an hour of it being posted onto their sites. YouTube has previously said its systems can detect nearly 70% of violent extremist content within eight hours of upload, and nearly 50% within two hours. ",

        "content": "Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo and Mercedes Lewis Hamilton set the pace on day two of the final pre-season test as McLaren suffered more problems. Ricciardo edged out Hamilton by 0.353 seconds for fastest time, but the Mercedes was substantially quicker when the cars were on equivalent tyres. Fernando Alonso was delayed for nearly seven hours after his McLaren broke down because of an oil leak. It was the latest in a series of reliability problems for the team. Alonso managed less than a third of the laps done during the day by Ricciardo and the Mercedes and Renault drivers. Alonso did 47 laps in the morning before stopping out on track after just over two hours of the day's running. The team said they would get him out later in the day - but managed to do so with only 13 minutes to go. He was on track for only eight minutes before the day was brought to a premature end when rookie Charles Leclerc went off in the Sauber. Alonso's problems made it the fourth of six days of pre-season testing so far on which McLaren have lost significant track time as a result of technical issues. The team are hoping to be close to the front this season following their switch to Renault engines following three difficult years with Honda. McLaren racing director Eric Boullier insisted the team were on track, and that they were simply suffering the sort of niggles that can be expected in pre-season. \"We have some little issues which we have to fix, but it is just testing. It is part of the process,\" Boullier said. \"We are on top of this and it is a new partnership with Renault, new packaging, completely new packaging for the car as well. This is testing, give us time - it is fine.\" McLaren are not yet close to achieving the main ambition set by Boullier for this week of completing a race distance. Alonso, who has said he expects his team to be able to challenge for podium positions this season, is due to speak to the media this evening. The 36-year-old two-time champion did set the fifth fastest time of the day, but he was using the 'hyper-soft' tyre and was 1.8secs behind Ricciardo's pace-setting best on the same rubber. Hamilton did not use the hyper-soft tyre, although his team-mate Valtteri Bottas did after taking over the Mercedes for the afternoon session, and was 0.6secs slower than Ricciardo on it. Hamilton was 0.5secs quicker than Ricciardo on the ultra-soft tyre, and 0.8secs ahead on the medium tyre. The times are not necessarily directly comparable because the fuel loads and engine modes being used by the car are not made public by the teams and can make a significant different to performance. Ricciardo said it had been a \"good day\" and added: \"The Mercs still look pretty quick. There are probably a few 10ths in the tyre and their qualifying mode will be a bit more than ours. \"I think they have still got a bit more on the rest but it is not too bad. We are looking pretty good - better than we were 12 months ago.\" The fastest Ferrari time was set by Sebastian Vettel, who was fourth overall with a 1:19.541 on the soft tyre, which all the drivers are saying is more or less the same in performance as the medium at Barcelona. Carlos Sainz was sixth fastest in the factory Renault car - less than 0.2secs behind Alonso but using the medium tyre, which is well over a second slower than the hyper-soft.

        "content": "The last rebel-held enclave close to the Syrian capital Damascus has come under heavy bombardment amid fresh efforts at the UN to stop the fighting. Plumes of smoke rose above parts of the Eastern Ghouta region as troops loyal to President Bashar al-Assad moved closer, supported by tanks. At least 20 people are said to have been killed in the bombardment. In New York, the UN Security Council gathered to discuss the failure of a ceasefire it had demanded last week. It passed a resolution on 24 February demanding a 30-day truce across Syria but the government and its key ally Russia say it does not apply to some of the rebel groups holding the enclave. A UN convoy was allowed to deliver aid to the enclave on Monday but left without unloading all of its trucks as shells fell. More than 700 people have been killed in violence in the Eastern Ghouta in recent weeks, many of them children. Several reports suggest government forces are attempting to cut the region - home to about 393,000 people - in two. What is the latest on the fighting?\nAccording to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, quoted by AFP news agency, up to 45 people were killed in Wednesday's bombardments. The Ghouta Media Centre reported 20 deaths. Syrian soldiers and their allies could be seen on the move on the age of the enclave on Wednesday while, in the distance, smoke trails from air strikes rose over the rebel-held town of Misraba. Another village in the enclave, Beit Sawa, is reportedly now under full government control. At least 10% of the enclave is said to have been regained by the government in recent weeks. Adnan, 30, a Douma resident who has been sheltering below ground with his wife and two-year-old daughter, told Reuters news agency by telephone: \"It's bad in the basement but it's better than the bombing.\" What is being done to stop the violence?\nAli al-Za'tari, the UN humanitarian co-ordinator in Syria, appealed to the government in a letter to observe the ceasefire and allow medical supplies to be delivered, Reuters reports. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, said government claims it was \"taking every measure to protect its civilian population\" were \"frankly ridiculous\". People in the Eastern Ghouta, he said, faced an \"apocalypse intended, planned and executed by individuals within the Government, apparently with the full backing of some of their foreign supporters. It is urgent to reverse this catastrophic course, and to refer Syria to the International Criminal Court\". ",

        "content": "Argentina's last military ruler, Gen Reynaldo Bignone, has died aged 90. Gen Bignone died in a military hospital, where he was serving a life sentence for crimes against humanity. Bignone, who ruled from July 1918 to December 1983, was also serving a sentence for overseeing the systematic theft of babies from political prisoners. About 30,000 people were killed or disappeared under Argentina's military rule from 1976 to 1983. Bignone's crimes were part of the Dirty War, a brutal plan to silence the left-wing opposition in the country during the 1970s and 80s which included kidnapping, torturing and killing opponents, and handing their children to supporters of military rule. Among the crimes he was sentenced for were the kidnap and torture of more than 30 factory workers, most of them trade union activists. He was also found guilty of playing a role in the theft of 34 babies of detained left-wing activists and of abducting, torturing and murdering 56 people held at the Campo de Mayo military base outside Buenos Aires. He defended his actions until the end, describing them as \"a battle against terrorism\". Gen Bignone served as de facto president of Argentina in 1982-83, at the end of military rule, and oversaw the return to democracy. But before agreeing to hand over power to the democratically elected Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn, Bignone granted an amnesty to human rights violators and ordered the destruction of papers which documented the torture and disappearances of opponents of the military regime. The amnesty was eventually overturned and Bignone as well as other military rulers who had preceded him, such as Jorge Videla, were sentenced. Argentina's military regime\n1976: General Jorge Rafael Videla seizes power - thousands of political opponents rounded up and killed 1982: Videla's successor, General Leopoldo Galtieri, orders invasion of British-held Falkland Islands 1983: Civilian rule returns to Argentina, investigations into rights abuses begin 2010: Videla sentenced to life imprisonment for murders during his term in office 2012: Videla sentenced to 50 years for overseeing systematic theft of the babies of political prisoners 2013: Videla dies in prison, aged 87 ",

'Anti-Russian campaign'\nThe incident has drawn comparisons to the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko - a public inquiry concluded the killing of the Russian dissident was probably carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the Skripal case. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, but is open to co-operating with British police if requested. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said foreign media had used the incident as part of an anti-Russian campaign. \"It's a traditional campaign. The tradition is to make things up.

Paul Golding, 36, and Jayda Fransen, 31, were arrested over the distribution of leaflets and posting of online videos during a gang-rape trial. Fransen was convicted of three counts of religiously aggravated harassment. Golding was found guilty of one charge. They will be sentenced at Folkestone Magistrates' Court later. During their trial in January, the court heard they had targeted homes and people in Kent whom they believed were connected to a rape trial at Canterbury Crown Court where three Muslim men and a teenager were convicted of rape and jailed. Offensive leaflets\nThey filmed the abuse and then released it on social media and through the Britain First website. They also posted offensive leaflets through the letterboxes of houses in the area where the rape-trial defendants lived. The pair, both from Penge in south-east London, were arrested in May last year. Fransen had denied four counts while Golding denied three. Judge Justin Barron dismissed the remaining counts. Giving evidence, Fransen had denied being a racist and said she had carried out campaigns against people accused of sex offences. Mr Golding told the court he had often acted as Fransen's cameraman.

        "content": "The European Council has circulated draft guidelines for negotiations on the EU's future relationship with the UK after Brexit. Here are a few key quotes from the document. The European Council (which in this case represents the other 27 member states) says it wants the EU to have as close as possible a relationship with the UK in the future. But this document doesn't mince words. It says the EU27 have to take into account the \"repeatedly stated positions of the UK, which limit the depth of such a future partnership\". So there will be frictions, says this document, and negative economic consequences. As EU statements have emphasised throughout this process, the integrity of the single market comes first. That means you can't pick the rules and regulations that you like and ignore the ones you don't. Negotiations on the future partnership have yet to begin, of course, but this is a sobering (although not unexpected) rebuff to many of the suggestions put forward by Prime Minister Theresa May in her Mansion House speech last week. This is another way of saying what the EU has been saying for some time: you can't be half in and half out. Last week the prime minister suggested the UK would like to remain in EU agencies that deal with chemicals, medicines, and aviation - this suggests that will be anything but straightforward. The wording here doesn't explicitly rule out some form of associate membership, but it does emphasise the integral role that the European Court of Justice plays in overseeing all EU agencies. Businesses will be watching closely as this debate unfolds. In the words of European Council President Donald Tusk, \"it should come as no surprise that the only remaining possible model is a free-trade agreement\". The narrow negotiating mandate set out in these guidelines suggests that the EU doesn't think it will be much more ambitious than other free trade agreements (FTA) it has negotiated - Canada is the most obvious example. That means an FTA based on zero tariffs for goods and limited access for some services. But there is no mention at all of financial services - another UK priority - and the proposal for mutual recognition of standards appears to have been dismissed as a non-starter. The draft does, however, argue that existing reciprocal access to fishing waters should be maintained - a sensitive issue on both sides of the English Channel. We've consistently heard language like this from the EU. And anyway, the UK government has already said it wants to lead a global race to the top rather than a race to the bottom. But the EU is concerned about a level playing field, and it wants to tie in any future UK government that may think differently. So, there are a variety of ways in which this document suggests that fairness should be maintained - including \"autonomous remedies\", which would allow the EU to punish the UK if it thinks it is stepping out of line. Away from the most troublesome economic issues, both sides want to maintain a partnership that is as close and effective as possible. But the EU draft emphasises that it will have to take account of the fact that the UK will be outside the union, and there will need to be safeguards for all sorts of things from data protection to fundamental rights. To the UK, the EU's overall approach appears to be excessively legalistic, and in danger of missing the big picture. But this is how the EU - as a rules-based union - tends to approach negotiations. And, as EU leaders often point out, they didn't ask for Brexit in the first place. If you want something more ambitious on the economy, the document says, it's not too late to change your mind, but this plea from the EU is unlikely to produce any immediate results. This is the first draft of the guidelines EU leaders are due to adopt at a summit in Brussels later this month. It will then form the basis upon which Michel Barnier and his team begin negotiating with the UK on the future relationship. The aim of the EU is to agree upon a broad political statement by October, which can then be fleshed out in further negotiations to come. Could there be more flexibility built in over time? Perhaps, but it could take years, and the two sides begin the process far apart in terms of their expectations of what can be achieved.

        "content": "A nerve agent was used to try to murder a former Russian spy and his daughter, police have said. Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found unconscious in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon and remain critically ill. A police officer who was the first to attend the scene is now in a serious condition in hospital, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, head of Counter Terrorism Policing, said. Mr Rowley would not confirm the exact substance identified. \"This is being treated as a major incident involving attempted murder, by administration of a nerve agent,\" he said. \"Having established that a nerve agent is the cause of the symptoms... I can also confirm that we believe that the two people who became unwell were targeted specifically.\" He said there was no evidence of a widespread health risk to the public. Mr Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter were found slumped on a bench outside the Maltings shopping centre. Police want to speak to anyone who was in the city centre on Sunday afternoon. They are particularly keen to hear from people who ate at Zizzi or drank in The Bishop's Mill pub between 13:00 and 16:00 GMT. Both of those locations remain closed to the public. Mr Rowley said hundreds of detectives, forensic specialists, analysts and intelligence officers were working round the clock on the case. The investigation in Salisbury may take several more days, he added. 'Anti-Russian campaign'\nThe incident has drawn comparisons to the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko - a public inquiry concluded the killing of the Russian dissident was probably carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the Skripal case. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, but is open to co-operating with British police if requested. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said foreign media had used the incident as part of an anti-Russian campaign. \"It's a traditional campaign. The tradition is to make things up. We can only see it as a provocation,\" she said. Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6.

        "content": "World cycling's governing body should investigate whether Team Sky broke anti-doping rules after \"unacceptable\" findings in an MPs' report, UCI president David Lappartient says. The Frenchman told BBC Sport the findings of a Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee inquiry \"could affect the global credibility of the sport\". The report said Team Sky \"crossed an ethical line\" by using drugs allowed under anti-doping rules for medical purposes to enhance performance. \"If you are using substances to increase your performances, I think this is exactly what is cheating,\" Lappartient said. Team Sky have strongly denied using therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) for anything other than medical need. In a wide-ranging interview at the UCI's headquarters in Aigle, Switzerland, Lappartient said: The select committee report said Team Sky used the anti-inflammatory drug triamcinolone to prepare Britain's most decorated Olympian Sir Bradley Wiggins and a smaller group of riders for the Tour de France, which Wiggins won in 2012. Asthmatic Wiggins was granted TUEs to take the corticosteroid triamcinolone, which can treat allergies and respiratory issues, shortly before the 2011 Tour de France, his 2012 Tour win and the 2013 Giro d'Italia. But the report says he used it as many as nine times in four years, which Wiggins, in a BBC interview this week, described as \"completely malicious\". He added he took it just once out of competition - which is legal - \"after the 2013 Giro d'Italia, when I came out with a knee problem\". Wiggins told the BBC he is \"100%\" not a cheat. \"It's sad to see that when Team Sky was launched, I remember- they say 'we will be clean, we will win races and be clean, more white than white'. We can see in this report that it seems to be a little bit different,\" Lappartient said. The Frenchman said he now wanted the UCI's independent anti-doping division to investigate. \"We have the Cycling Anti-Doping Foundation, they have the power of investigation. I would like them to do this, to see if there is some violation of anti-doping rules,\" he explained. \"They had at the time the TUE agreement but now we have the evidence that it seems to be organised.\" He added that at the time the TUE system was \"a little bit simple\". \"Just by a letter of support from the doctor, then it was not so difficult to get the TUE, which is something completely different now,\" he said. \"So you have to put this in the context of the time; the grey zone was too big and it seemed that this grey zone has been used by Team Sky at the time so, is it doping? Is it just using the rules? That is why the MPs' report just says they were not breaching the rules.\" And referencing a Sky Sports interview with ex-Team Sky coach Shane Sutton, in which he called on Wiggins and former Team Sky doctor Richard Freeman to come forward with more details, he continued: \"I think we need to know more about all these stories, there are still some grey zones, even in this report. That's why I saw this morning or yesterday that Shane Sutton asked Wiggins to tell the truth, so what does that mean? \"I read the press release from Team Sky say 'look we apologise, we recognise that we made some mistakes'. A mistake is something you've done without an intention to be wrong. The report is a little bit different. \"It seems that it was a little bit organised, so it's maybe not a mistake but a fault, which is different, because that could affect the credibility globally of our sport and that's why I'm concerned about this.\" When asked if he agreed with the MPs that Team Sky \"crossed the ethical line\", Lappartient said: \"It's in the report, what I can read, you can see that substances were used not for health problems or with strong pain but to increase your performances, then yes, that is something unacceptable for me and the philosophy we have, even if it seems there is no breach, no violation of the rules.\" And when asked if there could still be cheating even if rules had not been broken, Lappartient said: \"If you are using substances to increase your performances I think this is exactly what is cheating.\" Four-time Tour de France winner Froome returned an adverse drug test result during his Vuelta a Espana victory in September. Now the Briton has to explain to cycling's world governing body how he returned double the allowed level of legal asthma drug Salbutamol in his urine. Froome, 32, has vehemently denied any wrongdoing and believes his legacy will not be tainted once the issue is resolved. He has chosen to continue riding in the meantime - he is currently competing in the Tirreno-Adriatico stage race - as there is no mandatory ban in this type of case and riders usually respond in private. However, Lappartient has previously said Team Sky should suspend Froome until the case is resolved. \"We need to have a decision as soon as possible for Chris Froome himself, for his team, for us, for cycling,\" he said on Wednesday. \"Of course we have to respect the rights of Chris Froome to defend what he thinks and what he believes with experts. So that's why it's taking some time. \"I'm not sure we can have the decision before May's Giro d'Italia - I hope we can have it at least before the Tour de France in July because, can you imagine if he's riding the Giro and with spectators crying against him, or if at the end he's disqualified from the Giro - that's something difficult for our sport.\" Lappartient added to have such a prominent rider under suspicion at the Tour de France \"would be a disaster for the image of cycling, even if on a legal point of view he has a right to ride\". \"But for the image of our sport that could be a disaster and I don't want to put our sport into trouble. So even for him to be more concentrated on defending his own case, from my point of view it would have been better for him not to ride.\" Team Sky rejected his earlier call to rest Froome but Lappartient, who replaced Britain's Brian Cookson as UCI president last year, said he may ask again. \"I think if we have no decision of course before the Tour de France I will ask them to reconsider maybe their position and to consider my first proposition,\" he said.

Aerial bombing killed at least 20 people as troops and tanks advanced. In New York, the UN Security Council gathered to discuss the failure of a ceasefire it had demanded last week. It passed a resolution on 24 February demanding a 30-day truce across Syria but the government and its key ally Russia say it does not apply to some of the rebel groups holding the enclave. A UN convoy was allowed to deliver aid to the enclave on Monday but left without unloading all of its trucks as shells fell. More than 700 people have been killed in recent weeks in violence in the Eastern Ghouta, home to about 393,000 people. Many victims are children. What is the latest on the fighting?\nAccording to the Observatory, up to 45 people were killed in Wednesday's bombardments. The Ghouta Media Centre reported 20 deaths. Syrian soldiers and their allies could be seen on the move on the edge of the enclave on Wednesday while, in the distance, smoke trails from air strikes rose over the rebel-held town of Misraba. Another village in the enclave, Beit Sawa, is reportedly now under full government control, with dozens of residents fleeing to Douma, the enclave's largest town. \"We escaped Beit Sawa to come here, under the bombs,\" one of them, Abu Qassem, told AFP. \"The situation is completely dead. Finished. We've got no clothes. Nothing to change into. No food.\" Adnan, 30, a Douma resident who has been sheltering below ground with his wife and two-year-old daughter, told Reuters news agency by telephone: \"It's bad in the basement but it's better than the bombing.\" What is being done to stop the violence?\nAli al-Za'tari, the UN humanitarian co-ordinator in Syria, appealed to the government in a letter to observe the ceasefire and allow medical supplies to be delivered, Reuters reports. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, said government claims it was \"taking every measure to protect its civilian population\" were \"frankly ridiculous\". People in the Eastern Ghouta, he said, faced an \"apocalypse intended, planned and executed by individuals within the Government, apparently with the full backing of some of their foreign supporters. It is urgent to reverse this catastrophic course, and to refer Syria to the International Criminal Court\". ",

        "content": "Using \"dog-speak\" is important in building a bond between a dog and their owner, scientists from the University of York have found. During a series of tests, dogs were spoken to in a high-pitched voice and again in a normal adult voice. Researchers then monitored which speaker the dogs responded to and wanted to interact with. PhD student Alex Benjamin said it seemed dogs were more likely to favour the speaker who used a high pitch. Baby talk\nThe researchers wanted to test whether speaking to dogs in \"dog-directed\" speech was useful to the animals, or whether humans did this simply because they view pets in the same way as babies. \"Dog-directed\" speech involves speaking in a high-pitched voice with exaggerated emotion - in a similar way that adults often talk to small children. Dr Katie Slocombe from the university's department of psychology explains: \"This high-pitched rhythmic speech is common in human interactions with dogs in western cultures, but there isn't a great deal known about whether it benefits a dog. \"We wanted to see whether social bonding between animals and humans was influenced by the type and content of the communication.\" Who's a good boy then?\nDuring the tests, phrases such as \"you're a good dog!\" and \"shall we go for a walk?\", were used. Next, another person would talk to the animal in a normal voice about non-dog-related content, for example \"I went to the cinema last night.\" The speakers then mixed \"dog-directed\" speech with non-dog-related words, and normal speech with dog-related words. Researchers measured both the attentiveness of the dog while the speaker was talking, and whom the dog wanted to interact with once the speaker had finished. The scientists found dogs were more likely to want to spend time with the speaker who had used both \"dog-directed\" speech and dog-related content. When the different types of speech were mixed up dogs did not show a preference for either speaker. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning It led student Alex Benjamin to conclude: \"This suggests that adult dogs need to hear dog-relevant words spoken in a high-pitched emotional voice in order to find it relevant.\" The researchers could start looking into whether puppies demonstrate similar preferences, however there are no plans to carry out the same tests with cats.

        "content": "A nerve agent was used to try to murder a former Russian spy and his daughter, police have said. Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found unconscious in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon and remain critically ill. A police officer who was the first to attend the scene is now in a serious condition in hospital, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said. Nerve agents are highly toxic chemicals that stop the nervous system working and shut down bodily functions. Mr Rowley, head of Counter Terrorism Policing, said government scientists had identified the agent used, but would not make that information public at this stage. \"This is being treated as a major incident involving attempted murder, by administration of a nerve agent,\" he said. \"Having established that a nerve agent is the cause of the symptoms... I can also confirm that we believe that the two people who became unwell were targeted specifically.\" He said there was no evidence of a widespread health risk to the public. Mr Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter were found slumped on a bench outside the Maltings shopping centre. Police want to speak to anyone who was in the city centre on Sunday afternoon. They are particularly keen to hear from people who ate at Zizzi or drank in The Bishop's Mill pub between 13:00 and 16:00 GMT. Both of those locations remain closed to the public. Mr Rowley said hundreds of detectives, forensic specialists, analysts and intelligence officers were working round the clock on the case. The investigation in Salisbury may take several more days, he added. 'Anti-Russian campaign'\nThe incident has drawn comparisons to the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko - a public inquiry concluded the killing of the Russian dissident was probably carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the Skripal case. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, but is open to co-operating with British police if requested. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said foreign media had used the incident as part of an anti-Russian campaign. \"It's a traditional campaign. The tradition is to make things up. We can only see it as a provocation,\" she said. Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Col Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years. ",

The company said it would reimburse \"expenses for family expansion\" as part of its commitment to promote equal opportunities for women. It already has paid maternity leave and creche facilities in all its hotels. The firm is seeking to break \"gender stereotypes\" that force many women to stop work when they have children. Taj Hotels said it would pay for \"various medical procedures\", including IVF treatments and the freezing of eggs, embryos and sperm, as well as artificial insemination. At the same time, the company said it was setting up a new incentive programme to give women a better chance of being promoted. Dr PV Murthy, global head of human resources at the hotel chain's parent firm, the Indian Hotels Company Limited (IHCL), said: \"We have been consistent in championing the cause for women. \"The extension of medical benefits and the women referral programme is in line with our commitment to encourage women for diverse roles in the company.\" IHCL runs 144 hotels in 11 countries.

The German Federal Police responded to the British four-time Olympic champion's initial claim by saying the accused officer was \"properly carrying out his duty\". Farah had posted a video on Instagram showing an altercation at the airport. But the police added they \"cannot see any indication of racial harassment\". Farah, 34, was travelling to Ethiopia in preparation for next month's London Marathon when the alleged incident took place. \"The guy is touching me up like crazy. Pure harassment. Pure, pure, harassment,\" the Somalia-born athlete wrote, later posting the 47-second video on social media with the caption \"Sad to see racial harassment in this day and age. 2018...!!!!\" In a statement, a police spokesperson said security checks at the airport are carried out by a private company on behalf of the State of Bavaria. \"It seemed that Sir Mo Farah did not agree with this passenger security check performed on him and blamed this check on a racist measure. Obviously he was very upset,\" the statement added. \"As Sir Mo Farah didn't want to leave the security check point, security staff asked the Federal Police officer seen in the video for support.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said foreign media had used the incident as part of an anti-Russian campaign. \"It's a traditional campaign. The tradition is to make things up. We can only see it as a provocation,\" she said. Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Col Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years. ",

        "content": "Save the Children \"failed\" to adequately deal with allegations against its ex-chief executive Justin Forsyth, according to leaked documents. A 2015 report seen by the BBC contains evidence suggesting then chairman Sir Alan Parker's \"very close\" relationship with Mr Forsyth may have affected how he responded to complaints. Three women employees accused Mr Forsyth of inappropriate behaviour, for which he said he had apologised. Sir Alan said he had nothing to add. A leaked email from the time recommended that Mr Forsyth should not be alone with female employees. Mr Forsyth said that he had taken \"responsibility\" for his mistakes, but did \"not accept as accurate some recent media reports on the details of the complaints\". On Tuesday, protesters from the Women's Equality Party interrupted a Save the Children board meeting with Sir Alan, to call for his resignation as Chairman of Save the Children International. End of Youtube post by Women's Equality Channel Alexia Pepper de Caires, a former Save the Children employee and Women's Equality Party member, was invited to meet the board on Wednesday following the protest. \"The board now has the information it needs to make decisions on the future of (Sir Alan's) leadership,\" she said. Save the Children UK said a new review of workplace ethics would ensure that what caused previous claimants hurt \"cannot be repeated\". It said the charity's \"new leadership\" and its trustees are \"committed to respect in the workplace\". Ethics expert Dr Suzanne Shale, who is leading a new independent review for the charity, said she \"acknowledges that past events may have caused distress to staff, and disquiet amongst those who support the work of the charity. We will listen to those accounts very carefully and with utmost consideration\". Last month, the BBC revealed Mr Forsyth faced three complaints of inappropriate behaviour towards female staff before leaving Save the Children in 2015. Days later, Mr Forsyth resigned from his role as deputy director of UNICEF, saying he did not want coverage of his past to \"damage\" the charities. Now a report leaked to Radio 4's PM programme, which has never been made public by the charity, exposes failures in how these complaints were handled. In it, a complainant claims Save the Children told her not to tell anyone about her case and that both her and Mr Forsyth's reputations were at risk. \"They weren't trying to protect me or safeguard any other women. It was just about covering this up as quickly as they could,\" she said. The report - by law firm Lewis Silkin - was commissioned as part of a review of how Save the Children had handled complaints of inappropriate behaviour. It was written in October 2015. Months later, Save the Children provided a reference for Mr Forsyth when he applied for a job at UNICEF, which made no mention of the complaints. In a separate leaked email in 2015, a senior staff member said that allegations of sexual harassment made against Mr Forsyth were \"not being treated with the appropriate degree of seriousness\" and that \"he should not be unaccompanied with female members of staff\" until they could be sure his behaviour would not be repeated. The senior staff member wrote that that they had no confidence in Sir Alan Parker's handling of the complaints, saying he had \"made a deliberate choice\u2026not to fully investigate these allegations\" and as a result had a \"conflict of interest\" in relation to the review. Who is Sir Alan Parker?\nAs well as being the international chairman of Save the Children, Sir Alan is the founder and chairman of the PR firm Brunswick and counts former prime ministers among his friends. Gordon Brown is godfather to his youngest son, and when David Cameron left Number 10, it was Sir Alan's west London mansion that became the Camerons' temporary home. More than 240 people have signed a petition calling for Sir Alan, who was chair of Save the Children UK at the time of the complaints against Mr Forsyth, to be held accountable and removed from his current role. The petition claims \"his abuse of that power to dampen the situation is widely known\" and signatories include current and former Save the Children staff. The complaints against Justin Forsyth:\nThe first case was reported in 2012. The victim described receiving numerous inappropriate text messages from Mr Forsyth, who was her boss. When she made it clear to Mr Forsyth that these texts were unwelcome and made her feel uncomfortable, he persisted in sending them. When she complained again, she alleges that he took her phone when he saw it had been left on her desk and deleted some of the texts. She then lodged an official complaint. The head of HR at the time is quoted in the report as saying: \"I thought the deleting of the texts was intimidating.\" Because Save The Children never formally questioned Mr Forsyth about the allegations, the report does not reflect his account of events. His lawyers say he categorically denies that he deleted any texts. The report is clear that a disciplinary investigation should have been held but states: \"no adequate investigation took place\". 'So scared'\nInstead, Sir Alan instructed a trustee to meet the complainant for a chat. In the evidence, the trustee claims that Sir Alan briefed him in advance that he believed she may have \"overreacted\". The complainant for her part described feeling \"just so scared\" when she would see Mr Forsyth. Sir Alan wrote a formal warning to Mr Forsyth. This letter no longer exists although the report says it should have remained on Mr Forsyth's record. A draft of that letter in the report warned that \"this type of conduct can amount to unlawful harassment\". In the report, Mr Forsyth insists the complaint was dealt with appropriately, adding that he had given up his bonus - worth \u00a320,000 - that year. Sir Alan was on the Performance and Remuneration Committee that awarded that bonus in 2012. The complainant said she was assured the formal warning would remain on Mr Forsyth's record and that \"if this ever happened again, Alan will walk (Mr Forsyth) out of the door.\" Both failed to happen and in 2015, two more women came forward with complaints. The second complainant was an employee who would often go on business trips with Mr Forsyth to where Save the Children operated in the field. During these trips, according to the leaked report, she received late night text messages from him, complimenting her on her work performance and asking her out for a drink. She declined but - according to her - the messages became \"more demanding\". Between trips, Mr Forsyth invited her for \"career chats\" after work. On one occasion, Mr Forsyth is alleged to have said: \"Look, I fancy you, you fancy me. Why don't we just stop pretending?\" She says she made it clear she wasn't interested and subsequently made excuses to avoid business trips with him. He sent her emails asking if she was avoiding him and she said that since then, she felt marginalised at work. The third complainant's account set out in the report describes how one night on a business trip \"they continued their work discussion, stopping outside (Mr Forsyth's) room... and (he) invited her into his room for a glass of wine. \"She sat on the table and he invited her to sit on the bed. She declined. She went to the bathroom and when she returned, he was reclining on his bed.\" On another evening, Mr Forsyth is alleged to have announced he was \"not CEO for the night\" and asked her about her love life. He began to talk about his sex life and told her she was \"beautiful and talented\". The complainant says she made it clear she was not interested and refused his advances. In a statement issued by his legal representatives, Mr Forsyth admitted \"personal mistakes during my time at Save The Children\". \"I recognise that on a few occasions I had unsuitable and thoughtless conversations with colleagues, which I subsequently discovered caused offence and hurt,\" he said. \"When this was brought to my attention on two separate occasions, I apologised unreservedly to the three colleagues involved. The concerns were handled through a process of mediation.\" 'People behave differently abroad'\nAfter the two later complaints, Save the Children's head of HR alerted Sir Alan, but evidence in the report shows he claimed he received a \"less than supportive response\". Recalling a conversation with Sir Alan, he said it was \"along the lines of 'Justin Forsyth is very important to the organisation; people behave differently when they're abroad; they would have been tired; they would have needed some mutual support; what were the complainants doing by agreeing to go to his hotel room in the first place.\" The account goes on to record that the head of HR was \"frustrated\" by Sir Alan's response, \"which he feared was as a result of Sir Alan Parker and Justin Forsyth being very close\". One complainant is quoted in the report saying: \"It's more about who Alan is and having Alan and his best mate Justin sort of talking to each other about how best to handle these girls.\" According to the report, Sir Alan said he didn't think there had been any \"serious misconduct\" or \"predatory behaviour\". He also rejected suggestions there should be any work done to look at the \"leadership culture\" at Save the Children in light of these complaints and \"generalised complaints of sexual advances and bullying\" by Brendan Cox, the widower of the MP Jo Cox, who was accused of sexual assault by a member of staff at the charity a couple of months later. Mr Cox says he does not accept the allegations, but acknowledges he \"made mistakes\" while working for Save the Children. Sir Alan is described as saying, \"the best way to protect the organisation from reputational risk is not to let the organisational response become disproportionate\". ",

        "content": "A nerve agent was used to try to murder a former Russian spy and his daughter, police have said. Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found unconscious in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon and remain critically ill. A police officer who was the first to attend the scene is now in a serious condition in hospital, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said. Nerve agents are highly toxic chemicals that stop the nervous system working and shut down bodily functions. They normally enter the body through the mouth or nose, but can also be absorbed through the eyes or skin. Mr Rowley, head of Counter Terrorism Policing, said government scientists had identified the agent used, but would not make that information public at this stage. \"This is being treated as a major incident involving attempted murder, by administration of a nerve agent,\" he said. \"Having established that a nerve agent is the cause of the symptoms... I can also confirm that we believe that the two people who became unwell were targeted specifically.\" He said there was no evidence of a widespread health risk to the public. Two other police officers who attended the scene were treated in hospital for minor symptoms, before they were given the all clear. It is understood their symptoms included itchy eyes and wheezing. Analysis\nBy Richard Galpin, BBC world affairs correspondent - formerly based in Moscow The announcement by the police that Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia are the victims of an attack in which a nerve agent was used makes the parallel with the poisoning of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 even stronger. Like the radioactive polonium used to kill Litvinenko, a nerve agent is not normally something criminal gangs or terrorist groups can make. Instead, it is usually manufactured by specialist laboratories under the control of governments - and that inevitably means suspicion will now be very much focused on Russia. Not only does it have a track record of using poisons to assassinate its enemies, there is also a motive in the case of Sergei Skripal. As a military intelligence officer in Russia, he betrayed his country by providing information to MI6, reportedly revealing the identities of Russian agents in Europe. And Russian President Vladimir Putin has in the past indicated that traitors deserve to die. Although the question remains, why would Mr Skripal be attacked now when he has been living in Britain for eight years and came here originally as part of a spy swap? Mr Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter were found slumped on a bench outside the Maltings shopping centre. Police want to speak to anyone who was in the city centre on Sunday afternoon. They are particularly keen to hear from people who ate at Zizzi or drank in The Bishop's Mill pub between 13:00 and 16:00 GMT. Both of those locations remain closed to the public. Mr Rowley said hundreds of detectives, forensic specialists, analysts and intelligence officers were working round the clock on the case. The investigation in Salisbury may take several more days, he added. 'Anti-Russian campaign'\nProf Malcolm Sperrin, fellow of the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine, said: \"Symptoms of exposure to nerve agents may include respiratory arrest, heart failure, twitching or spasms - anything where the nerve control is degraded. \"Nerve agents can cause death, but not necessarily at low-level exposure or with a minor dose.\" A public inquiry concluded the killing of the Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 was probably carried out with the approval of President Putin. On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the Skripal case. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, but is open to co-operating with British police if requested. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said foreign media had used the incident as part of an anti-Russian campaign. \"It's a traditional campaign. The tradition is to make things up.

        "content": "\"Watt.\" \"What?\" \"Watt!\" A player has been sent off after a referee mistook his name for dissent. Referee Dean Hulme asked Sanchez Watt, who was playing for Hemel Hempstead Town, for his name as he was about to be booked in a National League South game against East Thurrock United. The 27-year-old repeatedly replied: \"Watt\" but Hulme believed he was saying \"what?\" and sent him off for dissent. Hulme rescinded the card when it was explained Watt was not showing dissent. \"It was a human error,\" Hemel Hempstead chairman Dave Boggins told BBC Sport. \"The referee was man enough to rectify it. \"I think everybody found it amusing afterwards - including the referee. \"He came into the boardroom after the game and explained how he had made the mistake. \"He was very apologetic and saw the funny side of it. He was a good ref on the night to be fair to him.\" The incident happened towards the end of Hemel Hempstead's 2-0 win on Tuesday and Watt did not leave the field. Watt played three games for Arsenal in the League Cup as an 18-year-old, scoring against West Brom in the third round at Emirates Stadium on 22 September 2009. He has also played in the Championship for Leeds United and had spells at Sheffield Wednesday, Southend, Crawley and Colchester. Watt is on loan at Hemel Hempstead from Isthmian League side Billericay Town. ",

        "content": "McLaren's Fernando Alonso insists there is \"nothing fundamentally wrong\" after McLaren suffered more problems in F1 testing. Alonso was delayed for nearly seven hours after his McLaren broke down because of an oil leak. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo and Mercedes Lewis Hamilton set the pace on day two of the final pre-season test. \"There is nothing fundamentally wrong on the car. The issues we had are well under control,\" said Alonso. It was the latest in a series of reliability problems for the team. Alonso managed less than a third of the laps done during the day by Ricciardo and the Mercedes and Renault drivers. \"From a team, point of view, we are more or less OK,\" he added. \"Unfortunately we keep discovering small things every day but it is putting us in a strong position for Australia in the way we are reinforcing (how to fix) all the small issues.\" Alonso did 47 laps in the morning before stopping out on track after just over two hours of the day's running. The team said they would get him out later in the day - but managed to do so with only 13 minutes to go. He was on track for only eight minutes before the day was brought to a premature end when rookie Charles Leclerc went off in the Sauber. Alonso's problems made it the fourth of six days of pre-season testing so far on which McLaren have lost significant track time as a result of technical issues. The team are hoping to be close to the front this season following their switch to Renault engines following three difficult years with Honda. Alonso has one more day in the car on Thursday before the first race but he said: \"We probably need the last day to do some laps and some long runs to check extra things you keep discovering about the new car but in terms of fundamental answers you need over the winter they are already OK. \"I don't need the last day, to be honest. I will be in the car but if Australia was tomorrow it is OK.\" McLaren racing director Eric Boullier insisted the team were on track, and that they were simply suffering the sort of niggles that can be expected in pre-season. \"We are on top of this and it is a new partnership with Renault, new packaging, completely new packaging for the car as well. This is testing, give us time - it is fine,\" Boullier said. McLaren are not yet close to achieving the main ambition set by Boullier for this week of completing a race distance. Alonso, who has said he expects his team to be able to challenge for podium positions this season, did set the fifth fastest time of the day, but he was using the 'hyper-soft' tyre and was 1.8secs behind Ricciardo's pace-setting best on the same rubber. Ricciardo edged out Hamilton by 0.353 seconds for fastest time, but the Mercedes was substantially quicker when the cars were on equivalent tyres. Hamilton did not use the hyper-soft tyre, although his team-mate Valtteri Bottas did after taking over the Mercedes for the afternoon session, and was 0.6secs slower than Ricciardo on it. Hamilton was 0.5secs quicker than Ricciardo on the ultra-soft tyre, and 0.8secs ahead on the medium tyre. The times are not necessarily directly comparable because the fuel loads and engine modes being used by the car are not made public by the teams and can make a significant different to performance. Ricciardo said it had been a \"good day\" and added: \"The Mercs still look pretty quick. There are probably a few 10ths in the tyre and their qualifying mode will be a bit more than ours. \"I think they have still got a bit more on the rest but it is not too bad. We are looking pretty good - better than we were 12 months ago.\" The fastest Ferrari time was set by Sebastian Vettel, who was fourth overall with a 1:19.541 on the soft tyre, which all the drivers are saying is more or less the same in performance as the medium at Barcelona. Carlos Sainz was sixth fastest in the factory Renault car - less than 0.2secs behind Alonso but using the medium tyre, which is well over a second slower than the hyper-soft.

        "content": "Forces loyal to the Syrian government have reportedly taken half of the Eastern Ghouta - the last rebel-held enclave close to the capital Damascus. \"Regime forces control more than 50% of Ghouta,\" Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, told AFP news agency. Aerial bombing killed at least 20 people as troops and tanks advanced. In New York, the UN Security Council gathered to discuss the failure of a ceasefire it had demanded last week. It passed a resolution on 24 February demanding a 30-day truce across Syria but the government and its key ally Russia say it does not apply to some of the rebel groups holding the enclave. A UN convoy was allowed to deliver aid to the enclave on Monday but left without unloading all of its trucks as shells fell. More than 700 people have been killed in recent weeks in violence in the Eastern Ghouta, home to about 393,000 people. Many victims are children. What is the latest on the fighting?\nAccording to the Observatory, up to 45 people were killed in Wednesday's bombardments. The Ghouta Media Centre reported 20 deaths. Syrian soldiers and their allies could be seen on the move on the edge of the enclave on Wednesday while, in the distance, smoke trails from air strikes rose over the rebel-held town of Misraba. Another village in the enclave, Beit Sawa, is reportedly now under full government control, with dozens of residents fleeing to Douma, the enclave's largest town. \"We escaped Beit Sawa to come here, under the bombs,\" one of them, Abu Qassem, told AFP. \"The situation is completely dead. Finished. We've got no clothes. Nothing to change into. No food.\" Adnan, 30, a Douma resident who has been sheltering below ground with his wife and two-year-old daughter, told Reuters news agency by telephone: \"It's bad in the basement but it's better than the bombing.\" Rebel factions in Ghouta denied that Beit Sawa had been seized, according to the Kumait news agency, which is affiliated with Jaysh al-Islam Islamist fighters. What is being done to stop the violence?\nAli al-Za'tari, the UN humanitarian co-ordinator in Syria, appealed to the government in a letter to observe the ceasefire and allow medical supplies to be delivered, Reuters reports. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, said government claims it was \"taking every measure to protect its civilian population\" were \"frankly ridiculous\". People in the Eastern Ghouta, he said, faced an \"apocalypse intended, planned and executed by individuals within the Government, apparently with the full backing of some of their foreign supporters. It is urgent to reverse this catastrophic course, and to refer Syria to the International Criminal Court\". ",

        "content": "A nerve agent was used to try to murder a former Russian spy and his daughter, police have said. Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found unconscious in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon and remain critically ill. A police officer who was the first to attend the scene is now in a serious condition in hospital, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said. Nerve agents are highly toxic chemicals that stop the nervous system working and shut down bodily functions. They normally enter the body through the mouth or nose, but can also be absorbed through the eyes or skin. Mr Rowley, head of Counter Terrorism Policing, said government scientists had identified the agent used, but would not make that information public at this stage. \"This is being treated as a major incident involving attempted murder, by administration of a nerve agent,\" he said. \"Having established that a nerve agent is the cause of the symptoms... I can also confirm that we believe that the two people who became unwell were targeted specifically.\" He said there was no evidence of a widespread health risk to the public. Two other police officers who attended the scene were treated in hospital for minor symptoms, before they were given the all clear. It is understood their symptoms included itchy eyes and wheezing. Analysis\nBy Richard Galpin, BBC News correspondent - formerly based in Moscow The announcement by the police that Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia are the victims of an attack in which a nerve agent was used makes the parallel with the poisoning of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 even stronger. Like the radioactive polonium used to kill Litvinenko, a nerve agent is not normally something criminal gangs or terrorist groups can make. Instead, it is usually manufactured by specialist laboratories under the control of governments - and that inevitably means suspicion will now be very much focused on Russia. Not only does it have a track record of using poisons to assassinate its enemies, there is also a motive in the case of Sergei Skripal. As a military intelligence officer in Russia, he betrayed his country by providing information to MI6, reportedly revealing the identities of Russian agents in Europe. And Russian President Vladimir Putin has in the past indicated that traitors deserve to die. Although the question remains, why would Mr Skripal be attacked now when he has been living in Britain for eight years and came here originally as part of a spy swap? Mr Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter were found slumped on a bench outside the Maltings shopping centre. Police want to speak to anyone who was in the city centre on Sunday afternoon. They are particularly keen to hear from people who ate at Zizzi or drank in The Bishop's Mill pub between 13:00 and 16:00 GMT. Both of those locations remain closed to the public. There is also a cordon in place outside Mr Skripal's Salisbury home. A yellow forensic tent has been erected and police have been seen carrying equipment into the building. Mr Rowley said hundreds of detectives, forensic specialists, analysts and intelligence officers were working round the clock on the case. The investigation in Salisbury may take several more days, he added. Prof Malcolm Sperrin, fellow of the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine, said: \"Symptoms of exposure to nerve agents may include respiratory arrest, heart failure, twitching or spasms - anything where the nerve control is degraded. \"Nerve agents can cause death, but not necessarily at low-level exposure or with a minor dose.\" Alastair Hay, emeritus professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds, added: \"These are very difficult and dangerous chemicals to make.\" A public inquiry concluded the killing of the Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 was probably carried out with the approval of President Putin. On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the Skripal case. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, but is open to co-operating with British police if requested. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said foreign media had used the incident as part of an anti-Russian campaign. \"It's a traditional campaign. The tradition is to make things up. We can only see it as a provocation,\" she said. Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Col Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years. Do you have any information to share on this story?

        "content": "Imagine, if you can, a time before music stars either transmitted their every inane thought via social media or, depending on their PR strategy, transmitted very few thoughts at all. Imagine a time when we got some insight into their lives from writers who were blisteringly entertaining and often as opinionated as the stars they were interviewing. When what we did know about our idols wasn't old news within half an hour. When people bought magazines. OK, there's not much point harking back to the good old days - but the demise of the NME (yes, it's continuing digitally, but it's not the same) is the end of an era. The New Musical Express is one of those magazines that its readers (anybody over the age of 30 and with decent taste in music) has a deep emotional attachment to. Why? It bottled the exhilarating, kaleidoscopic, rampant music scene and brought it into our bedrooms. Music - and those who made it - meant so much. It still does. During its heyday, music was also the most exciting expression of a youth culture that, some of the time at least, was changing British society. The NME was a doorway to that world. Before rock music was reported in the mainstream press, before music television, and way before the internet, the NME was one of the only places to find out information about bands - or even, sometimes, to see what they looked like. Picking up a copy from a newsagent on a Thursday, and getting ink-stained fingers as you flicked through its pages, was a ritual. There were other music papers - like Melody Maker, Record Mirror, Sounds - which have long since fallen by the wayside. But NME was king. As well as giving you news about musicians, its writers got close enough to the bands to give you a glimpse of their worlds. In the glory days, they would accompany them on tour for weeks on end and witness - and often partake in - the wilder side of rock 'n' roll. Nick Kent, one of its legendary writers, hung out with Bowie, The Rolling Stones and Iggy Pop. Kate Tyler [nee Phillips] told BBC Radio 4's The Reunion in 2007 about teaching The Sex Pistols to roll joints, and drinking pernod on a bed with Ozzy Osbourne. Another NME great, Charles Shaar Murray, told the programme he was the fly on the wall on behalf of his readers. \"I always felt that I was in a privileged position by being on somebody's coach, being in somebody's hotel room, dressing room,\" he said. \"I thought, I have a quarter of a million invisible people on my shoulders here, and I'm going into this space where they can't go and it's my job to convey as much of the experience of what it is like to be here as I possibly can, so they'll feel that they're here too.\" They recounted it all in a pithy, sharp, sometimes barbed style inspired by the \"gonzo\" journalism of the likes of Truman Capote and Hunter S Thompson. As a result, the NME's writers were idolised almost as much as the stars they wrote about. Julie Burchill, Danny Baker, Danny Kelly, Tony Parsons, Paul Morley, Steve Lamacq and David Quantick were among the others to make their mark in its pages. Mark Ellen, a music press stalwart, described the paper's big beasts in The Independent as \"quixotic firebrands and towering egomaniacs drunk on their own power and ubiquity\". Parsons, one of the writers famously recruited through an ad asking for \"hip young gunslingers\", in 1976, wrote in his memoir: \"We were callow and cruel and selling 250,000 copies a week. We were so successful that our owners left us alone to merrily run amok.\" Rock 'n' roll behaviour took place in the NME offices as well as in the stars' dressing rooms. Karen Walter, the editor's secretary for 34 years, told The Telegraph last year how, on her first day in the office, she saw blackened spoons in the kitchen - used for cooking up drugs. She was told that if she wanted to make a cup of tea, she should \"bring a spoon from home and lock it in your drawer\". When I first started out, my ambitions were to make an album, tour America and be on the cover of the New Musical Express #RIPNME End of Twitter post by @billybragg The New Musical Express was like Doctor Who when I was younger, taking me to a magical world I didn't quite understand, very exciting when it landed on earth, with someone older always there to say \"it was better in my day\". #RIPNME End of Twitter post by @johnmckie Genuinely upset about NME no longer being printed. Was my bible as a teenager in the 1990s and when I managed to spend a week doing work experience there I was in heaven! #RIPNME End of Twitter post by @rwhitehouse13 I used to read the NME cover to cover every week, then each Christmas I wrapped my family's presents in the gig listings pages. This clearly had to stop in recent years, as handing over gifts covered in a hair product advert would have been really weird. End of Twitter post by @tom_airey The writers lived and breathed the music, though, and had enormous influence. Mark Ellen wrote: \"If Nick Kent penned a despatch declaring Marquee Moon by Television a masterpiece - which it was - then great swathes of the populace would believe him and buy a copy.\" The paper had the ability to make the careers of those acts it championed. And while it may not have quite broken the careers of those staid stars of soft rock it had no qualms about slagging off, it made them off limits to its army of readers. The heyday started in the rock 'n' roll boom of the 1960s, went on through the 1970s to the indie and acid house days of the '80s, and fuelled Britpop in the '90s. It carried on into the 21st Century, but the star power and mystique of many of the artists ebbed away, and there was more restricted access, greater commercial pressure and less of a \"scene\" for readers to identify with. But, for a while, as former features editor James Brown once put it: \"The NME mattered.\" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

        "content": "Forces loyal to the Syrian government have reportedly taken half of the Eastern Ghouta - the last rebel-held enclave close to the capital Damascus. \"Regime forces control more than 50% of Ghouta,\" Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, told AFP news agency. Aerial bombing killed at least 20 people as troops and tanks advanced. In New York, the UN Security Council gathered to discuss the failure of a ceasefire it had demanded last week. It passed a resolution on 24 February demanding a 30-day truce across Syria but the government and its key ally Russia say it does not apply to some of the rebel groups holding the enclave. A UN convoy was allowed to deliver aid to the enclave on Monday but left without unloading all of its trucks as shells fell. More than 700 people have been killed in recent weeks in violence in the Eastern Ghouta, home to about 393,000 people. Many victims are children. What is the latest on the fighting?\nAccording to the Observatory, up to 45 people were killed in Wednesday's bombardments. The Ghouta Media Centre reported 20 deaths. Syrian soldiers and their allies could be seen on the move on the edge of the enclave on Wednesday while, in the distance, smoke trails from air strikes rose over the rebel-held town of Misraba. Another village in the enclave, Beit Sawa, is reportedly now under full government control, with dozens of residents fleeing to Douma, the enclave's largest town. \"We escaped Beit Sawa to come here, under the bombs,\" one of them, Abu Qassem, told AFP. \"The situation is completely dead. Finished. We've got no clothes. Nothing to change into. No food.\" Adnan, 30, a Douma resident who has been sheltering below ground with his wife and two-year-old daughter, told Reuters news agency by telephone: \"It's bad in the basement but it's better than the bombing.\" Rebel factions in Ghouta denied that Beit Sawa had been seized, according to the Kumait news agency, which is affiliated with Jaysh al-Islam Islamist fighters. What is being done to stop the violence?\nAli al-Za'tari, the UN humanitarian co-ordinator in Syria, appealed to the government in a letter to observe the ceasefire and allow medical supplies to be delivered, Reuters reports. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, said government claims it was \"taking every measure to protect its civilian population\" were \"frankly ridiculous\". People in the Eastern Ghouta, he said, faced an \"apocalypse intended, planned and executed by individuals within the Government, apparently with the full backing of some of their foreign supporters. It is urgent to reverse this catastrophic course, and to refer Syria to the International Criminal Court\". ",

        "content": "The Sri Lankan government says more troops have been deployed to the central district of Kandy, to try to end days of violence against Muslims. Police used tear gas to disperse Buddhist rioters who have attacked mosques and Muslim-owned businesses. They are defying a curfew imposed after a Buddhist youth died during an altercation with a group of Muslims. A state of emergency has been imposed and the curfew extended, and authorities are blocking social media. The authorities had feared retaliation after a young Muslim man's body was found in a burnt-out building in Kandy on Tuesday. Fresh clashes between mobs from the majority Sinhalese and minority Muslim communities erupted in several areas overnight, and a number of properties were set on fire. On Wednesday, there were reports that a Sinhalese man had died when a hand grenade he was carrying went off in a Kandy district. Police leave has been cancelled and \"the army has been deployed in tens and thousands\" in the scenic hilly area, said government spokesman Rajitha Senarathane. President Maithripala Sirisena toured Kandy on Wednesday, saying he had \"ordered that the full force of the law be used against troublemakers\", reported AFP news agency. Meanwhile, the influential former captain of the Sri Lankan cricket team, Kumar Sangakkara, called for the violence to stop and said there was \"no place for racism or violence\": No one in Sri Lanka can be marginalized or threatened or harmed due to their ethnicity or religion. We are One Country and One people. Love, trust and acceptance should be our common mantra. No place for racism and violence. STOP. Stand together and stand strong. End of Twitter post by @KumarSanga2 Last week, the eastern town of Ampara also saw anti-Muslim violence over a dispute in a shop. Tensions have been building in Buddhist-majority Sri Lanka since 2012, said to have been fuelled by hard-line Buddhists. Under the state of emergency, the authorities are able to arrest and detain suspects for long periods, and deploy forces where needed. It is the first time in seven years Sri Lanka has imposed the measure. The country was under a state of emergency for nearly three decades when the government fought Tamil rebels in the civil war that ended in 2009. \"Access to certain social media sites and messaging platforms will be restricted with immediate effect until further notice,\" said a statement from Sri Lanka's largest mobile phone provider Dialog. A senior government minister told the BBC that Facebook, WhatsApp and other social platforms were being used to carry hate speech and misinformation aimed at inciting more violence. Schools have been closed and a curfew extended until Thursday evening. Foreign governments have urged their citizens to stay away from large crowds and protests, and warn that there could be more unrest. The UN has urged that immediate action be taken against perpetrators of the violence. End of Twitter post by ",

        "content": "Media playback is not supported on this device World cycling's governing body should investigate whether Team Sky broke anti-doping rules after \"unacceptable\" findings in an MPs' report, UCI president David Lappartient says. The Frenchman told BBC Sport the findings of a Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee inquiry \"could affect the global credibility of the sport\". The report said Team Sky \"crossed an ethical line\" by using drugs allowed under anti-doping rules for medical purposes to enhance performance. \"If you are using substances to increase your performances, I think this is exactly what is cheating,\" Lappartient said. Team Sky have strongly denied using therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) for anything other than medical need. In a wide-ranging interview at the UCI's headquarters in Aigle, Switzerland, Lappartient said: The select committee report said Team Sky used the anti-inflammatory drug triamcinolone to prepare Britain's most decorated Olympian Sir Bradley Wiggins and a smaller group of riders for the Tour de France, which Wiggins won in 2012. Asthmatic Wiggins was granted TUEs to take the corticosteroid triamcinolone, which can treat allergies and respiratory issues, shortly before the 2011 Tour de France, his 2012 Tour win and the 2013 Giro d'Italia. But the report says he used it as many as nine times in four years, which Wiggins, in a BBC interview this week, described as \"completely malicious\". He added he took it just once out of competition - which is legal - \"after the 2013 Giro d'Italia, when I came out with a knee problem\". Wiggins told the BBC he is \"100%\" not a cheat. \"It's sad to see that when Team Sky was launched, I remember- they say 'we will be clean, we will win races and be clean, more white than white'. We can see in this report that it seems to be a little bit different,\" Lappartient said. The Frenchman said he now wanted the UCI's independent anti-doping division to investigate. \"We have the Cycling Anti-Doping Foundation, they have the power of investigation. I would like them to do this, to see if there is some violation of anti-doping rules,\" he explained. \"They had at the time the TUE agreement but now we have the evidence that it seems to be organised.\" He added that at the time the TUE system was \"a little bit simple\". \"Just by a letter of support from the doctor, then it was not so difficult to get the TUE, which is something completely different now,\" he said. \"So you have to put this in the context of the time; the grey zone was too big and it seemed that this grey zone has been used by Team Sky at the time so, is it doping? Is it just using the rules? That is why the MPs' report just says they were not breaching the rules.\" And referencing a Sky Sports interview with ex-Team Sky coach Shane Sutton, in which he called on Wiggins and former Team Sky doctor Richard Freeman to come forward with more details, he continued: \"I think we need to know more about all these stories, there are still some grey zones, even in this report. That's why I saw this morning or yesterday that Shane Sutton asked Wiggins to tell the truth, so what does that mean? \"I read the press release from Team Sky say 'look we apologise, we recognise that we made some mistakes'. A mistake is something you've done without an intention to be wrong. The report is a little bit different. \"It seems that it was a little bit organised, so it's maybe not a mistake but a fault, which is different, because that could affect the credibility globally of our sport and that's why I'm concerned about this.\" When asked if he agreed with the MPs that Team Sky \"crossed the ethical line\", Lappartient said: \"It's in the report, what I can read, you can see that substances were used not for health problems or with strong pain but to increase your performances, then yes, that is something unacceptable for me and the philosophy we have, even if it seems there is no breach, no violation of the rules.\" And when asked if there could still be cheating even if rules had not been broken, Lappartient said: \"If you are using substances to increase your performances I think this is exactly what is cheating.\" Four-time Tour de France winner Froome returned an adverse drug test result during his Vuelta a Espana victory in September. Now the Briton has to explain to cycling's world governing body how he returned double the allowed level of legal asthma drug Salbutamol in his urine. Froome, 32, has vehemently denied any wrongdoing and believes his legacy will not be tainted once the issue is resolved. He has chosen to continue riding in the meantime - he is currently competing in the Tirreno-Adriatico stage race - as there is no mandatory ban in this type of case and riders usually respond in private. However, Lappartient has previously said Team Sky should suspend Froome until the case is resolved. \"We need to have a decision as soon as possible for Chris Froome himself, for his team, for us, for cycling,\" he said on Wednesday. \"Of course we have to respect the rights of Chris Froome to defend what he thinks and what he believes with experts. So that's why it's taking some time. \"I'm not sure we can have the decision before May's Giro d'Italia - I hope we can have it at least before the Tour de France in July because, can you imagine if he's riding the Giro and with spectators crying against him, or if at the end he's disqualified from the Giro - that's something difficult for our sport.\" Lappartient added to have such a prominent rider under suspicion at the Tour de France \"would be a disaster for the image of cycling, even if on a legal point of view he has a right to ride\". \"But for the image of our sport that could be a disaster and I don't want to put our sport into trouble. So even for him to be more concentrated on defending his own case, from my point of view it would have been better for him not to ride.\" Team Sky rejected his earlier call to rest Froome but Lappartient, who replaced Britain's Brian Cookson as UCI president last year, said he may ask again. \"I think if we have no decision of course before the Tour de France I will ask them to reconsider maybe their position and to consider my first proposition,\" he said. When asked if Team Sky principal and founder Sir Dave Brailsford should resign over the controversy, Lappartient said: \"I think he has to take the best decision for cycling in Great Britain. \"I saw all the statements on this in Great Britain that damaged Team Sky, damaged cycling and we know how strong is cycling, I'm just thinking about the millions of fans riding their bikes, enjoying cycling, I don't want them to go away from our sport. \"I want just to tell them that they have to believe in the UCI, they have to believe in a clean sport. Our sport is probably one of the most clean sports and more clean than in the past. \"It seems they have created these wrongdoings, so I really think that the issue for him is to think about the future of his team - of all the employees, all the riders. I'm sure they are clean and doing what they have to do to ride in a proper way. The decision must be in line with all this and to continue to support cycling.\" Lappartient also called on Team Sky to join the Mouvement Pour un Cyclisme Credible (MPCC), a group of teams who promote clean cycling and want corticosteroids banned. \"They always said that they don't need to join MPCC because are doing more and they are more clean. The reports seem to demonstrate the contrary,\" he said. The UCI president said the fallout from the Team Sky saga had reinforced his concerns about the use of TUEs, and called on the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) to ban corticosteroids and painkiller tramadol.

But there are fears the plans could spark a trade war, and it reportedly helped lead to the resignation of top economic adviser Gary Cohn. Mr Trump has railed against the US trade deficit, arguing that other countries have been \"taking advantage of\" the US for decades. \"We expect that the president will sign something by the end of the week and there are potential carve-outs for Mexico and Canada based on national security, and possibly other countries as well based on that process,\" Ms Sanders told reporters \"That would be a case by case and country by country basis but it would be determined, whether or not there is a national security exemption.\" ",

        "content": "The leader and deputy leader of far-right group Britain First have been found guilty of religiously aggravated harassment. Paul Golding, 36, and Jayda Fransen, 32, were arrested over the distribution of leaflets and posting of online videos during a gang-rape trial. Fransen was convicted of three counts of religiously aggravated harassment. Golding was found guilty of one charge. Both were jailed at Folkestone Magistrates' Court. Fransen was handed a 36-week sentence and Golding 18 weeks. During their trial in January, the court heard they had targeted homes and people in Kent whom they believed were connected to a rape trial at Canterbury Crown Court where three Muslim men and a teenager were convicted of rape and jailed. The pair, both from Penge in south-east London, were arrested in May last year. 'Hostility' towards Muslims\nThey denied a total of seven counts of harassment. Judge Justin Barron threw out three of the charges, while Fransen was found guilty of three and Golding of one. He told the court the pair were \"well-known\", \"controversial\" and \"generate their own publicity\", but his verdict was based \"solely on admissible evidence heard in court\". He said their words and actions \"demonstrated hostility\" towards Muslims and the Muslim faith. \"I have no doubt it was their joint intention to use the facts of the case [in Canterbury] for their own political ends. \"It was a campaign to draw attention to the race, religion and immigrant background of the defendants.\" Both Fransen and Golding were convicted on a joint charge of religiously aggravated harassment after an incident last May at 555 Pizza takeaway in Ramsgate, when Fransen banged on the windows and doors of the shop and screamed \"paedophile\" and \"foreigner\". However, in each case, they instead targeted innocent members of the public. They filmed the abuse and then released it on social media and through the Britain First website. They also posted offensive leaflets through the letterboxes of houses in the area where the defendants lived. Giving evidence, Fransen had denied being a racist and said she had carried out campaigns against people accused of sex offences, while Mr Golding told the court he had often acted as her cameraman. Fransen was convicted of abuse after visiting a house she wrongly believed to be the current address of Sershah Muslimyar, a defendant in the trial. She was also convicted of visiting the Kent home of another defendant, Tamin Rahmani, and shouting racist abuse through the front door while his pregnant partner Kelli Best was there. During sentencing Fransen spoke over the judge, saying: \"This is a very sad day for British justice. Everything I did was for the children of this country and they are worth it.\" As Britain First supporters left the courtroom they hurled abuse at court staff and members of the press, shouting \"no surrender\".

        "content": "Save the Children \"failed\" to adequately deal with allegations against its ex-chief executive Justin Forsyth, according to leaked documents. A 2015 report seen by the BBC contains evidence suggesting then chairman Sir Alan Parker's \"very close\" relationship with Mr Forsyth may have affected how he responded to complaints. Three women employees accused Mr Forsyth of inappropriate behaviour, for which he said he had apologised. Sir Alan said he had nothing to add. A leaked email from the time recommended that Mr Forsyth should not be alone with female employees. Mr Forsyth said that he had taken \"responsibility\" for his mistakes \"many years ago\", but did \"not accept as accurate much of what has been reported today, either in tone or fact\". He said he \"strongly refutes a number of the claims\" and added that he had not seen the 2015 report. On Tuesday, protesters from the Women's Equality Party interrupted the charity's board meeting to call for Sir Alan's resignation as Chairman of Save the Children International. End of Youtube post by Women's Equality Channel Alexia Pepper de Caires, a former Save the Children employee and Women's Equality Party member, was invited to meet the board on Wednesday following the protest. \"The board now has the information it needs to make decisions on the future of (Sir Alan's) leadership,\" she said. Save the Children UK said a new review of workplace ethics would ensure that what caused previous claimants hurt \"cannot be repeated\". It said the charity's \"new leadership\" and its trustees are \"committed to respect in the workplace\". Ethics expert Dr Suzanne Shale, who is leading a new independent review for the charity, said she \"acknowledges that past events may have caused distress to staff, and disquiet amongst those who support the work of the charity. We will listen to those accounts very carefully and with utmost consideration\". Last month, the BBC revealed Mr Forsyth faced three complaints of inappropriate behaviour towards female staff before leaving Save the Children in 2015. Days later, Mr Forsyth resigned from his role as deputy director of UNICEF, saying he did not want coverage of his past to \"damage\" the charities. Now a report leaked to Radio 4's PM programme, which has never been made public by the charity, exposes failures in how these complaints were handled. In it, a complainant claims Save the Children told her not to tell anyone about her case and that both her and Mr Forsyth's reputations were at risk. \"They weren't trying to protect me or safeguard any other women. It was just about covering this up as quickly as they could,\" she said. The report - by law firm Lewis Silkin - was commissioned as part of a review of how Save the Children had handled complaints of inappropriate behaviour. It was written in October 2015. Months later, Save the Children provided a reference for Mr Forsyth when he applied for a job at UNICEF, which made no mention of the complaints. In a separate leaked email in 2015, a senior staff member said that allegations of sexual harassment made against Mr Forsyth were \"not being treated with the appropriate degree of seriousness\" and that \"he should not be unaccompanied with female members of staff\" until they could be sure his behaviour would not be repeated. The senior staff member wrote that they had no confidence in Sir Alan Parker's handling of the complaints, saying he had \"made a deliberate choice\u2026not to fully investigate these allegations\" and as a result had a \"conflict of interest\" in relation to the review. Who is Sir Alan Parker?\nAs well as being the international chairman of Save the Children, Sir Alan is the founder and chairman of the PR firm Brunswick and counts former prime ministers among his friends. Gordon Brown is godfather to his youngest son, and when David Cameron left Number 10, it was Sir Alan's west London mansion that became the Camerons' temporary home. More than 240 people have signed a petition calling for Sir Alan, who was chair of Save the Children UK at the time of the complaints against Mr Forsyth, to be held accountable and removed from his current role. The petition claims \"his abuse of that power to dampen the situation is widely known\" and signatories include current and former Save the Children staff. The complaints against Justin Forsyth:\nThe first case was reported in 2012. The victim described receiving numerous inappropriate text messages from Mr Forsyth, who was her boss. When she made it clear to Mr Forsyth that these texts were unwelcome and made her feel uncomfortable, he persisted in sending them. When she complained again, she alleges that he took her phone when he saw it had been left on her desk and deleted some of the texts. She then lodged an official complaint. The head of HR at the time is quoted in the report as saying: \"I thought the deleting of the texts was intimidating.\" Because Save The Children never formally questioned Mr Forsyth about the allegations, the report does not reflect his account of events. His lawyers say he categorically denies that he deleted any texts. The report is clear that a disciplinary investigation should have been held but states: \"no adequate investigation took place\". 'So scared'\nInstead, Sir Alan instructed a trustee to meet the complainant for a chat. In the evidence, the trustee claims that Sir Alan briefed him in advance that he believed she may have \"overreacted\". The complainant for her part described feeling \"just so scared\" when she would see Mr Forsyth. Sir Alan wrote a formal warning to Mr Forsyth. This letter no longer exists although the report says it should have remained on Mr Forsyth's record. A draft of that letter in the report warned that \"this type of conduct can amount to unlawful harassment\". In the report, Mr Forsyth insists the complaint was dealt with appropriately, adding that he had given up his bonus - worth \u00a320,000 - that year. Sir Alan was on the Performance and Remuneration Committee that awarded that bonus in 2012. The complainant said she was assured the formal warning would remain on Mr Forsyth's record and that \"if this ever happened again, Alan will walk (Mr Forsyth) out of the door.\" Both failed to happen and in 2015, two more women came forward with complaints. The second complainant was an employee who would often go on business trips with Mr Forsyth to where Save the Children operated in the field. During these trips, according to the leaked report, she received late night text messages from him, complimenting her on her work performance and asking her out for a drink. She declined but - according to her - the messages became \"more demanding\". Between trips, Mr Forsyth invited her for \"career chats\" after work. On one occasion, Mr Forsyth is alleged to have said: \"Look, I fancy you, you fancy me. Why don't we just stop pretending?\" She says she made it clear she wasn't interested and subsequently made excuses to avoid business trips with him. He sent her emails asking if she was avoiding him and she said that since then, she felt marginalised at work. The third complainant's account set out in the report describes how one night on a business trip \"they continued their work discussion, stopping outside (Mr Forsyth's) room... and (he) invited her into his room for a glass of wine. \"She sat on the table and he invited her to sit on the bed. She declined. She went to the bathroom and when she returned, he was reclining on his bed.\" On another evening, Mr Forsyth is alleged to have announced he was \"not CEO for the night\" and asked her about her love life. He began to talk about his sex life and told her she was \"beautiful and talented\". The complainant says she made it clear she was not interested and refused his advances. In a statement issued by his legal representatives, Mr Forsyth admitted \"personal mistakes during my time at Save The Children\". \"I recognise that on a few occasions I had unsuitable and thoughtless conversations with colleagues, which I subsequently discovered caused offence and hurt,\" he said. \"When this was brought to my attention on two separate occasions, I apologised unreservedly to the three colleagues involved. The concerns were handled through a process of mediation.\" 'People behave differently abroad'\nAfter the two later complaints, Save the Children's head of HR alerted Sir Alan, but evidence in the report shows he claimed he received a \"less than supportive response\". Recalling a conversation with Sir Alan, he said it was \"along the lines of 'Justin Forsyth is very important to the organisation; people behave differently when they're abroad; they would have been tired; they would have needed some mutual support; what were the complainants doing by agreeing to go to his hotel room in the first place.\" The account goes on to record that the head of HR was \"frustrated\" by Sir Alan's response, \"which he feared was as a result of Sir Alan Parker and Justin Forsyth being very close\". One complainant is quoted in the report saying: \"It's more about who Alan is and having Alan and his best mate Justin sort of talking to each other about how best to handle these girls.\" According to the report, Sir Alan said he didn't think there had been any \"serious misconduct\" or \"predatory behaviour\". He also rejected suggestions there should be any work done to look at the \"leadership culture\" at Save the Children in light of these complaints and \"generalised complaints of sexual advances and bullying\" by Brendan Cox, the widower of the MP Jo Cox, who was accused of sexual assault by a member of staff at the charity a couple of months later. Mr Cox says he does not accept the allegations, but acknowledges he \"made mistakes\" while working for Save the Children. Sir Alan is described as saying, \"the best way to protect the organisation from reputational risk is not to let the organisational response become disproportionate\". ",

        "content": "Canada and Mexico may be exempt from US plans to impose tariffs on metal imports, the White House says. Other countries may also see \"carve-outs\" on national security grounds, press secretary Sarah Sanders said. US President Donald Trump has said steel products will face a 25% tariff, with 10% on aluminium goods. But there are fears the plans could spark a trade war, and it reportedly helped lead to the resignation of White House economic adviser Gary Cohn. The EU has proposed retaliatory measures against a number of US goods including bourbon and peanut butter. Despite opposition at home and abroad, Ms Sanders said the US president would sign the measures in by the end of the week. But she added: \"There are potential carve-outs for Mexico and Canada based on national security, and possibly other countries as well based on that process. That would be [on] a case-by-case and country by country basis.\" Why is Mr Trump doing this?\nMr Trump has railed against the US trade deficit, arguing that other countries have been \"taking advantage of\" the US for decades. One of his campaign promises was to rebuild the US steel and aluminium industries which he said has suffered \"disgraceful\" treatment from other countries, in particular China. Last week he dismissed concerns he could trigger a trade war, instead saying \"trade wars are good\" and were something the US would easily win. The latest comments from the White House mark a softening of tone. Mr Trump has already hinted he could drop plans to impose tariffs on Mexican and Canadian metals but linked it to the US getting a better deal in the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). What's the reaction been?\nThe US plans have sparked worldwide alarm and jolted stock markets. Critics argue that the tariffs would fail to protect American jobs and would ultimately raise prices for consumers. International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde warned \"nobody wins\" in a trade war, saying it would harm global economic growth. The EU has set out tit-for-tat plans to impose import duties on bourbon, peanut butter, cranberries, orange juice, steel, and industrial products. Other countries, including China, are also considering retaliatory steps. Members of Mr Trump's Republican party are concerned too, with House Speaker Paul Ryan saying he wanted to see tariffs that were \"more surgical and more targeted\". Tuesday saw the departure of Gary Cohn from the White House, who is a strong supporter of free trade. ",

        "content": "Media playback is not supported on this device World cycling's governing body should investigate whether Team Sky broke anti-doping rules after \"unacceptable\" findings in an MPs' report, UCI president David Lappartient says. The Frenchman told BBC Sport the findings of a Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee inquiry \"could affect the global credibility of the sport\". The report said Team Sky \"crossed an ethical line\" by using drugs allowed under anti-doping rules for medical purposes to enhance performance. \"If you are using substances to increase your performances, I think this is exactly what is cheating,\" Lappartient said. Team Sky have strongly denied using therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) for anything other than medical need. They also say they would be \"happy to co-operate with any investigation\" because they are \"concerned\" the committee had \"presented unsubstantiated allegations\". In a wide-ranging interview at the UCI's headquarters in Aigle, Switzerland, Lappartient said: The select committee report said Team Sky used the anti-inflammatory drug triamcinolone to prepare Britain's most decorated Olympian Sir Bradley Wiggins and a smaller group of riders for the Tour de France, which Wiggins won in 2012. Asthmatic Wiggins was granted TUEs to take the corticosteroid triamcinolone, which can treat allergies and respiratory issues, shortly before the 2011 Tour de France, his 2012 Tour win and the 2013 Giro d'Italia. But the report says he used it as many as nine times in four years, which Wiggins, in a BBC interview this week, described as \"completely malicious\". He added he took it just once out of competition - which is legal - \"after the 2013 Giro d'Italia, when I came out with a knee problem\". Wiggins told the BBC he is \"100%\" not a cheat. \"It's sad to see that when Team Sky was launched, I remember- they say 'we will be clean, we will win races and be clean, more white than white'. We can see in this report that it seems to be a little bit different,\" Lappartient said. The Frenchman said he now wanted the UCI's independent anti-doping division to investigate. \"We have the Cycling Anti-Doping Foundation, they have the power of investigation. I would like them to do this, to see if there is some violation of anti-doping rules,\" he explained. \"They had at the time the TUE agreement but now we have the evidence that it seems to be organised.\" He added that at the time the TUE system was \"a little bit simple\". \"Just by a letter of support from the doctor, then it was not so difficult to get the TUE, which is something completely different now,\" he said. \"So you have to put this in the context of the time; the grey zone was too big and it seemed that this grey zone has been used by Team Sky at the time so, is it doping? Is it just using the rules? That is why the MPs' report just says they were not breaching the rules.\" And referencing a Sky Sports interview with ex-Team Sky coach Shane Sutton, in which he called on Wiggins and former Team Sky doctor Richard Freeman to come forward with more details, he continued: \"I think we need to know more about all these stories, there are still some grey zones, even in this report. That's why I saw this morning or yesterday that Shane Sutton asked Wiggins to tell the truth, so what does that mean? \"I read the press release from Team Sky say 'look we apologise, we recognise that we made some mistakes'. A mistake is something you've done without an intention to be wrong. The report is a little bit different. \"It seems that it was a little bit organised, so it's maybe not a mistake but a fault, which is different, because that could affect the credibility globally of our sport and that's why I'm concerned about this.\" When asked if he agreed with the MPs that Team Sky \"crossed the ethical line\", Lappartient said: \"It's in the report, what I can read, you can see that substances were used not for health problems or with strong pain but to increase your performances, then yes, that is something unacceptable for me and the philosophy we have, even if it seems there is no breach, no violation of the rules.\" And when asked if there could still be cheating even if rules had not been broken, Lappartient said: \"If you are using substances to increase your performances I think this is exactly what is cheating.\" Four-time Tour de France winner Froome returned an adverse drug test result during his Vuelta a Espana victory in September. Now the Briton has to explain to cycling's world governing body how he returned double the allowed level of legal asthma drug Salbutamol in his urine. Froome, 32, has vehemently denied any wrongdoing and believes his legacy will not be tainted once the issue is resolved. He has chosen to continue riding in the meantime - he is currently competing in the Tirreno-Adriatico stage race - as there is no mandatory ban in this type of case and riders usually respond in private. However, Lappartient has previously said Team Sky should suspend Froome until the case is resolved. \"We need to have a decision as soon as possible for Chris Froome himself, for his team, for us, for cycling,\" he said on Wednesday. \"Of course we have to respect the rights of Chris Froome to defend what he thinks and what he believes with experts. So that's why it's taking some time. \"I'm not sure we can have the decision before May's Giro d'Italia - I hope we can have it at least before the Tour de France in July because, can you imagine if he's riding the Giro and with spectators crying against him, or if at the end he's disqualified from the Giro - that's something difficult for our sport.\" Lappartient added to have such a prominent rider under suspicion at the Tour de France \"would be a disaster for the image of cycling, even if on a legal point of view he has a right to ride\". \"But for the image of our sport that could be a disaster and I don't want to put our sport into trouble. So even for him to be more concentrated on defending his own case, from my point of view it would have been better for him not to ride.\" Team Sky rejected his earlier call to rest Froome but Lappartient, who replaced Britain's Brian Cookson as UCI president last year, said he may ask again. \"I think if we have no decision of course before the Tour de France I will ask them to reconsider maybe their position and to consider my first proposition,\" he said. When asked if Team Sky principal and founder Sir Dave Brailsford should resign over the controversy, Lappartient said: \"I think he has to take the best decision for cycling in Great Britain. \"I saw all the statements on this in Great Britain that damaged Team Sky, damaged cycling and we know how strong is cycling, I'm just thinking about the millions of fans riding their bikes, enjoying cycling, I don't want them to go away from our sport. \"I want just to tell them that they have to believe in the UCI, they have to believe in a clean sport. Our sport is probably one of the most clean sports and more clean than in the past. \"It seems they have created these wrongdoings, so I really think that the issue for him is to think about the future of his team - of all the employees, all the riders. I'm sure they are clean and doing what they have to do to ride in a proper way. The decision must be in line with all this and to continue to support cycling.\" Lappartient also called on Team Sky to join the Mouvement Pour un Cyclisme Credible (MPCC), a group of teams who promote clean cycling and want corticosteroids banned. \"They always said that they don't need to join MPCC because are doing more and they are more clean. The reports seem to demonstrate the contrary,\" he said. The UCI president said the fallout from the Team Sky saga had reinforced his concerns about the use of TUEs, and called on the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) to ban corticosteroids and painkiller tramadol. In response, Team Sky told BBC Sport: \"Team Sky is happy to co-operate with any investigation by the UCI and we would welcome further scrutiny of the select committee's report. \"While we have acknowledged past failings, we strongly deny the very serious new allegations about the use of medication to enhance performance, as does Bradley Wiggins. \"Furthermore, we are concerned that the committee presented these unsubstantiated allegations without providing evidence to support them, which is fundamentally unfair to the team and its riders. \"We welcome any review by the UCI which can help establish the nature of the evidence relied on by the committee in coming to its conclusions.\" ",

        "content": "Tottenham were knocked out of the Champions League as Juventus came from behind to move into the quarter-finals. The first leg in Italy ended 2-2 and Son Heung-min put Spurs ahead at Wembley with a scuffed finish from Kieran Trippier's low cross. But Gonzalo Higuain scored an equaliser when he steered in Sami Khedira's pass. And less than three minutes later, Paulo Dybala raced on to Higuain's through ball and slotted past Hugo Lloris to seal a 4-3 aggregate victory. Tottenham came close to scoring an equaliser that would have taken the tie into extra time but the impressive Son shot narrowly wide from 20 yards and Harry Kane headed against the post in the 90th minute. For Spurs, who last reached the Champions League quarter-finals in 2010-11, it was a first defeat in 18 matches, while Juventus are unbeaten since 22 November - a run of 20 games. Mauricio Pochettino's side are the first English team this season to be eliminated from the Champions League. Elsewhere on Wednesday, Manchester City lost 2-1 to Basel but gained a 5-2 aggregate win to join Liverpool in the quarter-finals. Manchester United and Chelsea could make it four Premier League teams in the last eight of Europe's top club competition when they play the second legs of their ties next week. United entertain Sevilla on Tuesday following a goalless first leg in Spain, before Chelsea play at Barcelona on Wednesday after it finished 1-1 at Stamford Bridge. More to follow.

        "content": "French companies caught discriminating against women over pay will be given three years to close the gap or face fines under new labour proposals. The government revealed the planned crackdown to unions and employers on Wednesday, giving them a month to iron out details. If passed by parliament, the measure will be rolled out by 2020. Men are still paid on average 9% more than women in France despite equal pay laws going back 45 years. The measure is part of a social reform bill due to be presented to Prime Minister Edouard Philippe's cabinet at the end of next month. \"The crazy thing is that it all exists in law but equality is missing in practice,\" said Mr Philippe. \"Our aim is to pass from fine words to true, genuine equality.\" How would the new measure work?\nSpecial software would be installed on company payroll systems to monitor unjustified pay gaps. Larger firms - those employing at least 250 staff - would get the new software next year while firms employing between 50 and 249 staff would be affected from 2020. The new system would be launched in 2022 and there would be four times the current number of spot checks. Those firms which failed to address unfair pay gaps within three years of a warning could be fined up to 1% of their wage bill. How do other countries compare?\nAcross the 28 EU member states, the average \"unexplained\" gender pay gap is a little higher than France's at 11.5%, according to Eurostat figures. Neighbouring Belgium has a gap of just 2.5% whereas for women in Lithuania, it is a staggering 24.2%. ",

        "content": "A Texas appeals court has overturned a man's conviction after finding a judge had inappropriately electrocuted him in court, US media report. Terry Lee Morris was convicted of soliciting sexual performance from a child and was sentenced to 60 years. Judge George Gallagher ordered the bailiff to activate a stun belt sending 50,000 volts through Morris when he allegedly refused to answer questions. The higher court found that stun belts cannot be used as punishment in court. Mr Morris appealed his 2014 conviction alleging that his constitutional rights were violated when the judge used the belt as punishment for not answering questions properly. The belts - used by courtrooms such as the one Tarrant County in Texas - are affixed around the legs or midsection of a suspect in court and are used to deliver a shock to the person should they become violent. Mr Morris said he was too scared to return to court out of more electrical shocks, the Texas Eighth Court of Appeals in El Paso heard. The appeals court ruled on 28 February that Mr Morris' shocks and removal from the court was a violation of his constitutional right to be present and confront witnesses during his trial. The decision was first reported by the Texas Lawyer news website on Tuesday. He has now been ordered to stand for a new trial. During the case in which Mr Morris was convicted of soliciting sexual acts from a 15-year-old girl, Judge Gallagher asked him to enter his plea of \"guilty or not guilty\". When Mr Morris responded by saying he had a lawsuit against Judge Gallagher and his defence lawyer, the judge warned him that he would shock him if he did not \"follow the rules\", the Washington Post newspaper reported, citing court transcripts. Mr Morris asked the judge to recuse himself because of the lawsuit when the judge directed the bailiff to shock him. The judge ordered the defendant to be shocked two more times as Mr Morris told the court he had a history of mental illness and complained that he was being \"tortured\". Mr Morris's attorney, Bill Ray, told the Texas Lawyer that he did not object to the use of the stun belt because his client was acting \"like a loaded cannon ready to go off\", and that he did not really believe that he was being shocked. The appeals court said the order clarifies that all Texas judges are not allowed to shock defendants for refusing to follow the court's rules of decorum. \"Never before have we seen any behaviour like this, nor do we hope to ever see such behaviour again,\" wrote appeals court Justice Yvonne Rodriguez. \"We must speak out against it, lest we allow practices like these to affront the very dignity of the proceedings we seek to protect and lead our courts to drift from justice into barbarism.\" More on stun weapons\n",

United entertain Sevilla on Tuesday following a goalless first leg in Spain, before Chelsea play at Barcelona on Wednesday after it finished 1-1 at Stamford Bridge. Pochettino has performed outstanding work in piecing together an exciting and talented Tottenham team - but familiar questions will be asked after this devastating loss. Spurs showed maturity as well as excellence to come from two goals down to earn a draw in Turin in the first leg, putting themselves in a favourable position to finish the job and secure a place in the quarter-finals. And yet, from a position of strength bolstered even further by Son's goal just before the interval, Spurs once again came up short. There is no doubting the quality in this Tottenham side and they were excellent in spells at Wembley, but with two Premier League title campaigns promising much but unable to deliver and an FA Cup semi-final loss to Chelsea last season, the requirement for tangible success is intensifying. The hosts missed chances and suffered ill luck in the closing moments when Kane's header somehow stayed out, but in the end they paid a heavy price for three minutes of slackness that undid all the fine work from the first leg. The best sides back up quality with trophies. Spurs now need the FA Cup this season. Former Premier League striker Chris Sutton on BBC Radio 5 live I'm shell-shocked and so are the Spurs players.

        "content": "Kilmarnock climbed to fifth in the Premiership with a commanding victory over 10-man St Johnstone. Jordan Jones was the game's central figure, tormenting the Perth side with his pace and trickery. Jones was brought down by Aaron Comrie for the penalty that led to Kris Boyd opening the scoring from the spot. The visitors' Jason Kerr was sent off for bringing Jones down, then Lee Erwin doubled Kilmarnock's advantage after the break. St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright was unhappy with some of the decisions of referee Willie Collum, who approached the visitors' dugout during the first half to speak to Wright. Kilmarnock are now unbeaten in their last nine home games, and their last eight games overall, while St Johnstone sit in eighth place following a run of one win in their last six games. Wright's side subdued an early Kilmarnock flurry and looked strong in possession, creating a couple of reasonable opportunities. Yet that opening flattered to deceive the visitors. The main threat to St Johnstone was Jones, who was direct and pacy; at times, the winger was devastating. He turned out to be the key to Kilmarnock's latest home victory, although St Johnstone did contribute to their own downfall. The pivotal moment arrived on the half-hour mark, when Jones gathered on the left just inside the box. He drew Comrie in and with a rapid double flick of the ball, provoked a late challenge which Collum deemed worthy of a penalty. It seemed a straightforward decision, although Wright clearly disagreed on the touchline. Boyd duly slammed the ball home for his 18th goal of an increasingly prolific season for the veteran striker. Tempers flared shortly after when Jones was on the receiving end of an overly robust challenge from Comrie which earned the St Johnstone defender a yellow card. Wright seemed to suggest a dive, which caused a reaction from the Kilmarnock player and raised the home fans' noise levels. They didn't recede much afterwards, with Rugby Park transformed recently into a joyous, positive environment in which winning football games has begun to seem routine. Decibels peaked once again when Chris Millar lost possession cheaply in midfield to Jones. The winger skipped away and was unceremoniously clipped by Kerr, who was ordered off. It was effectively the end of the contest. Erwin then fired off the post, with Aaron Tshibola's stunning long-range drive into the net from the rebound denied by an offside flag against Boyd, who seemed to be in a position that interfered with St Johnstone goalkeeper Alan Mannus's line of sight. Erwin would not be denied. Midway through the second half, he cut inside on the right and curled a lovely left-foot shot inside the far post after great build-up play. St Johnstone had no answer and the only surprise was that there were no further goals conceded. For Kilmarnock, Steve Clarke seems to have emphatically delivered his main target already: there's no chance of relegation now.

        "content": "Manchester City booked their place in the Champions League quarter-finals, but lost a home game for the first time since 2016 as they were beaten by Basel in the second leg of their last-16 tie. City's 4-0 away win meant the second leg was a formality, with Pep Guardiola resting several first-team players. Gabriel Jesus opened the scoring by tapping home Bernardo Silva's cross. But Mohamed Elyounoussi lashed home a leveller and then set up Michael Lang's second-leg winner. It is only the second time City have reached the quarter-finals of the European Cup or Champions League. Juventus, Real Madrid and Liverpool are the other sides to have clinched their last-eight spots this week. The damage was done in Switzerland three weeks ago. A much-changed City were impressive going forward in the first half, although John Stones and Aymeric Laporte had some shaky moments at the back. Their 17-year-old midfielder Phil Foden - the youngest Englishman to play in a Champions League knockout game - showed some good touches in midfield. Silva and Leroy Sane were explosive at times going forward in the first half, with both players having a hand in their goal. Sane ran from deep, played a one-two with Foden and charged on some more before playing the ball right to Silva. His low cross was tapped in at the back post by Jesus, making his first start of 2018. Elyounoussi equalised for Basel after finding some space in the box but City still dominated the first half. Ilkay Gundogan forced a save and the German and Yaya Toure both had shots blocked. The second half was poorer, though, and City fell to just a fourth defeat of the season and first at home since 3 December 2016. The hosts lacked bite going forward and left room at the back for Lang to receive Elyounoussi's pass and smash into the top of the net at Bravo's near post. Guardiola named Ederson, Kyle Walker, Sergio Aguero, Kevin de Bruyne and Nicolas Otamendi on the bench in case of emergency. But he was not too worried about a result that is more a defeat in name than in practice and only introduced more youngsters from the bench. Basel's dominance of Swiss football looks like it might come to an end this year. Having won eight titles in a row, they sit 14 points behind leaders Young Boys this season. But at least they ended their European campaign on a high. No team have ever gone through having lost the first leg 4-0 at home and boss Raphael Wicky never pretended an unprecedented comeback was on the cards, saying before the game that it would \"look a bit daft\" to talk about it. He did set his side a target of winning the second leg, though, and they achieved it - in front of a sizeable, noisy away support. They deserved their victory - with City midfielder Yaya Toure even saying so after the game. Elyounoussi had a hand in both goals, scoring the first and then assisting right-back Lang - who scored his second winner against a Manchester side in the Champions League this season - having netted the only goal against United in the group stages.

        "content": "Forces loyal to the Syrian government have reportedly taken half of the Eastern Ghouta - the last rebel-held enclave close to the capital Damascus. \"Regime forces control more than 50% of Ghouta,\" Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, told AFP news agency. Aerial bombing killed at least 20 people as troops and tanks advanced. In New York, the UN Security Council gathered to discuss the failure of a ceasefire it had demanded last week. It passed a resolution on 24 February demanding a 30-day truce across Syria but the government and its key ally Russia say it does not apply to some of the rebel groups holding the enclave. A UN convoy was allowed to deliver aid to the enclave on Monday but left without unloading all of its trucks as shells fell. At least 850 people are believed to have been killed since an offensive against the Eastern Ghouta, which is home to about 393,000 people, began on 18 February. Many victims are children. What is the latest on the fighting?\nAccording to the Observatory, 62 people were killed in Wednesday's bombardments. The Ghouta Media Centre reported at least 20 deaths. Syrian soldiers and their allies could be seen on the move on the edge of the enclave on Wednesday while, in the distance, smoke trails from air strikes rose over the rebel-held town of Misraba. Another village in the enclave, Beit Sawa, is reportedly now under full government control, with dozens of residents fleeing to Douma, the enclave's largest town. \"We escaped Beit Sawa to come here, under the bombs,\" one of them, Abu Qassem, told AFP. \"The situation is completely dead. Finished. We've got no clothes. Nothing to change into. No food.\" Adnan, 30, a Douma resident who has been sheltering below ground with his wife and two-year-old daughter, told Reuters news agency by telephone: \"It's bad in the basement but it's better than the bombing.\" Rebel factions in Ghouta denied Beit Sawa had been seized, according to the Kumait news agency, which is affiliated with Jaysh al-Islam Islamist fighters. What is being done to stop the violence?\nAli al-Za'tari, the UN humanitarian co-ordinator in Syria, appealed to the government in a letter to observe the ceasefire and allow medical supplies to be delivered, Reuters reports. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, said government claims it was \"taking every measure to protect its civilian population\" were \"frankly ridiculous\". People in the Eastern Ghouta, he said, faced an \"apocalypse intended, planned and executed by individuals within the Government, apparently with the full backing of some of their foreign supporters. It is urgent to reverse this catastrophic course, and to refer Syria to the International Criminal Court\". ",

        "content": "Tottenham's Champions League ambitions came crashing down as Juventus produced two goals inside three second-half minutes to decide the destiny of their last-16 tie. Son Heung-min's scrambled finish six minutes before the interval strengthened Spurs' position at Wembley after they recovered from two goals down to draw the first leg in Turin 2-2. In an eventful first 45 minutes, Son and Harry Kane had wasted chances for the hosts, while Juventus were denied a clear penalty when Douglas Costa was brought down by Jan Vertonghen. Tottenham appeared to be in control until Gonzalo Higuain turned in Sami Khedira's flick to give Juventus a 64th-minute lifeline - which they capitalised on ruthlessly and Paulo Dybala raced clear for the decisive goal three minutes later. Mauricio Pochettino's side fought to revive their chances but to no avail, coming agonisingly close in the dying moments when Kane's header hit the inside of the post but bounced right on the goal-line. For Spurs, who last reached the Champions League quarter-finals in 2010-11, it was a first defeat in 18 matches, while Juventus are unbeaten since 22 November - a run of 20 games. They are the first English team to be eliminated from this season's Champions League. Elsewhere on Wednesday, Manchester City lost 2-1 to Basel but went through 5-2 aggregate win to join Liverpool in the quarter-finals. Manchester United and Chelsea could make it four Premier League sides in the last eight of Europe's top club competition when they play the second legs of their ties next week. United entertain Sevilla on Tuesday following a goalless first leg in Spain, before Chelsea play at Barcelona on Wednesday after it finished 1-1 at Stamford Bridge. Pochettino has performed outstanding work in piecing together an exciting and talented Tottenham team - but familiar questions will be asked after this devastating loss. Spurs showed maturity as well as excellence to come from two goals down to earn a draw in Turin in the first leg, putting themselves in a favourable position to finish the job and secure a place in the quarter-finals. And yet, from a position of strength bolstered even further by Son's goal just before the interval, Spurs once again came up short. There is no doubting the quality in this Tottenham side and they were excellent in spells at Wembley, but with two Premier League title campaigns promising much but unable to deliver and an FA Cup semi-final loss to Chelsea last season, the requirement for tangible success is intensifying. The hosts missed chances and suffered ill luck in the closing moments when Kane's header somehow stayed out, but in the end they paid a heavy price for three minutes of slackness that undid all the fine work from the first leg. The best sides back up quality with trophies. Spurs now need the FA Cup this season. Juventus could have been forgiven for believing luck was against them when referee Szymon Marciniak and his assistant somehow failed to penalise Vertonghen for a first-half challenge on Costa in the area. They had been put under pressure by Spurs and survived a succession of near misses - but showed their ruthlessness to deliver those two devastating blows and then the resilience to fiercely protect their advantage. Juventus have a streak of experience a mile wide through the core of Massimiliano Allegri's side and it was epitomised when the old firm of keeper Gianluigi Buffon and Giorgio Chiellini celebrated as if a goal had been scored after the veteran defender made a crucial clearance late on. And for Buffon, who has previously said he will conclude a glittering career if Juve fail to win the Champions League this season, the dream lives on. Son's outstanding season continued as he scored the goal that put Spurs in control of this tie until they let it slip from their grasp. The South Korea international has now scored 16 goals in 42 games this term and been involved in 25 goals in total, testimony to his growing influence. And yet here it could have been even better, forcing an early save from Buffon and firing another good opportunity across the face of goal before scoring with a scuffed finish. Son was inches off target late on as Spurs pressed - his performance mirroring that of his team on a night when they got plenty right but could not make the crucial moments count. Former Premier League striker Chris Sutton on BBC Radio 5 live I'm shell-shocked and so are the Spurs players. It was three minutes of sheer madness - they were in total control in the first half. Juventus love defending. They defended for their lives and they saw the game out pretty well. Higuain took his chance when he got it and you have to say the second goal was beautifully worked. Spurs will feel unlucky, especially after that Harry Kane chance in the last minute. Pochettino is a dreamer, but this turned into a nightmare. They've been put out by a side who were cuter, more street-wise, and took their chances. More to follow. Line-ups\nMatch Stats\nLive Text\nMatch ends, Tottenham Hotspur 1, Juventus 2.

        "content": "Manchester City booked their place in the Champions League quarter-finals, but lost a home game for the first time since 2016 as they were beaten by Basel in the second leg of their last-16 tie. City's 4-0 away win meant the second leg was a formality, with Pep Guardiola resting several first-team players. Gabriel Jesus opened the scoring by tapping home Bernardo Silva's cross. But Mohamed Elyounoussi lashed home a leveller and then set up Michael Lang's second-leg winner. It is only the second time City have reached the quarter-finals of the European Cup or Champions League. Juventus, Real Madrid and Liverpool are the other sides to have clinched their last-eight spots this week. The damage was done in Switzerland three weeks ago. A much-changed City were impressive going forward in the first half, although John Stones and Aymeric Laporte had some shaky moments at the back. Their 17-year-old midfielder Phil Foden - the youngest Englishman to play in a Champions League knockout game - showed some good touches in midfield. Silva and Leroy Sane were explosive at times going forward in the first half, with both players having a hand in their goal. Sane ran from deep, played a one-two with Foden and charged on some more before playing the ball right to Silva. His low cross was tapped in at the back post by Jesus, making his first start of 2018. Elyounoussi equalised for Basel after finding some space in the box but City still dominated the first half. Ilkay Gundogan forced a save and the German and Yaya Toure both had shots blocked. The second half was poorer, though, and City fell to just a fourth defeat of the season and first at home since 3 December 2016 when they lost 3-1 to Chelsea. The hosts lacked bite going forward and left room at the back for Lang to receive Elyounoussi's pass and smash into the top of the net at Bravo's near post. Guardiola named Ederson, Kyle Walker, Sergio Aguero, Kevin de Bruyne and Nicolas Otamendi on the bench in case of emergency. But he was not too worried about a result that is more a defeat in name than in practice and only introduced more youngsters from the bench. Basel's dominance of Swiss football looks like it might come to an end this year. Having won eight titles in a row, they sit 14 points behind leaders Young Boys this season. But at least they ended their European campaign on a high. No team have ever gone through having lost the first leg 4-0 at home and boss Raphael Wicky never pretended an unprecedented comeback was on the cards, saying before the game that it would \"look a bit daft\" to talk about it. He did set his side a target of winning the second leg, though, and they achieved it - in front of a sizeable, noisy away support. They deserved their victory - with City midfielder Yaya Toure even saying so after the game. Elyounoussi had a hand in both goals, scoring the first and then assisting right-back Lang - who scored his second winner against a Manchester side in the Champions League this season - having netted the only goal against United in the group stages.

        "content": "The White House says there could be exemptions to US plans to impose tariffs on metal imports, in a softening of its tough stance. Canada, Mexico and other countries may see \"carve-outs\" on national security grounds, press secretary Sarah Sanders said. US President Donald Trump has said steel products will face a 25% tariff, with 10% on aluminium goods. But there are fears the plans could spark a trade war. The EU has proposed retaliatory measures against a number of US goods including bourbon and peanut butter. Despite opposition at home and abroad, Ms Sanders said the US president would sign the measures in by the end of the week, with US media reporting it could happen as early as Thursday. But she added: \"There are potential carve-outs for Mexico and Canada based on national security, and possibly other countries as well based on that process. That would be [on] a case-by-case and country by country basis.\" Why is Mr Trump doing this?\nMr Trump has railed against the US trade deficit, arguing that other countries have been \"taking advantage of\" the US for decades. One of his campaign promises was to rebuild the US steel and aluminium industries which he said has suffered \"disgraceful\" treatment from other countries, in particular cheap Chinese imports. From Bush 1 to present, our Country has lost more than 55,000 factories, 6,000,000 manufacturing jobs and accumulated Trade Deficits of more than 12 Trillion Dollars. Last year we had a Trade Deficit of almost 800 Billion Dollars. Bad Policies & Leadership. Must WIN again! #MAGA End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump Last week he dismissed concerns he could trigger a trade war, instead saying \"trade wars are good\" and were something the US would easily win. Mr Trump has already hinted he could drop plans to impose tariffs on Mexican and Canadian metals but linked it to the US getting a better deal in the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mexico and Canada are among the main suppliers of steel to the US. What's the reaction been?\nThe US plans have sparked worldwide alarm and jolted stock markets. Critics argue that the tariffs would fail to protect American jobs and would ultimately raise prices for consumers. International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde warned \"nobody wins\" in a trade war, saying it would harm global economic growth. The EU has set out tit-for-tat plans to impose import duties on bourbon, peanut butter, cranberries, orange juice, steel, and industrial products. Other countries, including China, are also considering retaliatory steps. Members of Mr Trump's Republican party are concerned too, with House Speaker Paul Ryan saying he wanted to see tariffs that were \"more surgical and more targeted\". Tuesday saw the departure of top White House economic advisor Gary Cohn, who is a strong supporter of free trade. ",

        "content": "Kilmarnock climbed to fifth in the Premiership with a commanding victory over 10-man St Johnstone. Jordan Jones was the game's central figure, tormenting the Perth side with his pace and trickery. Jones was brought down by Aaron Comrie for the penalty that led to Kris Boyd opening the scoring from the spot. The visitors' Jason Kerr was sent off for bringing Jones down, then Lee Erwin doubled Kilmarnock's advantage after the break. St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright was unhappy with some of the decisions of referee Willie Collum, who approached the visitors' dugout during the first half to speak to Wright. Kilmarnock are now unbeaten in their last nine home games, and their last eight games overall, while St Johnstone sit in eighth place following a run of one win in their last six games. Wright's side subdued an early Kilmarnock flurry and looked strong in possession, creating a couple of reasonable opportunities. Yet that opening flattered to deceive the visitors. The main threat to St Johnstone was Jones, who was direct and pacy; at times, the winger was devastating. He turned out to be the key to Kilmarnock's latest home victory, although St Johnstone did contribute to their own downfall. The pivotal moment arrived on the half-hour mark, when Jones gathered on the left just inside the box. He drew Comrie in and with a rapid double flick of the ball, provoked a late challenge which Collum deemed worthy of a penalty. It seemed a straightforward decision, although Wright clearly disagreed on the touchline. Boyd duly slammed the ball home for his 18th goal of an increasingly prolific season for the veteran striker. Tempers flared shortly after when Jones was on the receiving end of an overly robust challenge from Comrie which earned the St Johnstone defender a yellow card. Wright seemed to suggest a dive, which caused a reaction from the Kilmarnock player and raised the home fans' noise levels. They didn't recede much afterwards, with Rugby Park transformed recently into a joyous, positive environment in which winning football games has begun to seem routine. Decibels peaked once again when Chris Millar lost possession cheaply in midfield to Jones. The winger skipped away and was unceremoniously clipped by Kerr, who was ordered off. It was effectively the end of the contest. Erwin then fired off the post, with Aaron Tshibola's stunning long-range drive into the net from the rebound denied by an offside flag against Boyd, who seemed to be in a position that interfered with St Johnstone goalkeeper Alan Mannus's line of sight. Erwin would not be denied. Midway through the second half, he cut inside on the right and curled a lovely left-foot shot inside the far post after great build-up play. St Johnstone had no answer and the only surprise was that there were no further goals conceded. For Kilmarnock, Steve Clarke seems to have emphatically delivered his main target already: there's no chance of relegation now.

        "content": "Tottenham's Champions League ambitions came crashing down as Juventus produced two goals inside three second-half minutes to decide the destiny of their last-16 tie. Son Heung-min's scrambled finish six minutes before the interval strengthened Spurs' position at Wembley after they recovered from two goals down to draw the first leg in Turin 2-2. In an eventful first 45 minutes, Son and Harry Kane had wasted chances for the hosts, while Juventus were denied a clear penalty when Douglas Costa was brought down by Jan Vertonghen. Tottenham appeared to be in control until Gonzalo Higuain turned in Sami Khedira's flick to give Juventus a 64th-minute lifeline - which they capitalised on ruthlessly and Paulo Dybala raced clear for the decisive goal three minutes later. Mauricio Pochettino's side fought to revive their chances but to no avail, coming agonisingly close in the dying moments when Kane's header hit the inside of the post but bounced right on the goal-line. For Spurs, who last reached the Champions League quarter-finals in 2010-11, it was a first defeat in 18 matches, while Juventus are unbeaten since 22 November - a run of 20 games. The London club are the first English team to be eliminated from this season's Champions League. Elsewhere on Wednesday, Manchester City lost 2-1 to Basel but went through 5-2 aggregate win to join Liverpool in the quarter-finals. Manchester United and Chelsea could make it four Premier League sides in the last eight of Europe's top club competition when they play the second legs of their ties next week. United entertain Sevilla on Tuesday following a goalless first leg in Spain, before Chelsea play at Barcelona on Wednesday after it finished 1-1 at Stamford Bridge. Pochettino has performed outstanding work in piecing together an exciting and talented Tottenham team - but familiar questions will be asked after this devastating loss. Spurs showed maturity as well as excellence to come from two goals down to earn a draw in Turin in the first leg, putting themselves in a favourable position to finish the job and secure a place in the quarter-finals. And yet, from a position of strength bolstered even further by Son's goal just before the interval, Spurs once again came up short. There is no doubting the quality in this Tottenham side and they were excellent in spells at Wembley, but with two Premier League title campaigns promising much but unable to deliver and an FA Cup semi-final loss to Chelsea last season, the requirement for tangible success is intensifying. The hosts missed chances and suffered ill luck in the closing moments when Kane's header somehow stayed out, but in the end they paid a heavy price for three minutes of slackness that undid all the fine work from the first leg. The best sides back up quality with trophies. Spurs now need the FA Cup this season. Juventus could have been forgiven for believing luck was against them when referee Szymon Marciniak and his assistant somehow failed to penalise Vertonghen for a first-half challenge on Costa in the area. They had been put under pressure by Spurs and survived a succession of near misses - but showed their ruthlessness to deliver those two devastating blows and then the resilience to fiercely protect their advantage. Juventus have a streak of experience a mile wide through the core of Massimiliano Allegri's side and it was epitomised when the old firm of keeper Gianluigi Buffon and Giorgio Chiellini celebrated as if a goal had been scored after the veteran defender made a crucial clearance late on. And for Buffon, who has previously said he will conclude a glittering career if Juve fail to win the Champions League this season, the dream lives on. Son's outstanding season continued as he scored the goal that put Spurs in control of this tie until they let it slip from their grasp. The South Korea international has now scored 16 goals in 42 games this term and been involved in 25 goals in total, testimony to his growing influence. And yet it could have been even better. He forced an early save from Buffon and fired another good opportunity across the face of goal before scoring with a scuffed finish. Son was inches off target late on as Spurs pressed - his performance mirroring that of his team on a night when they got plenty right but could not make the crucial moments count. Former Premier League striker Chris Sutton on BBC Radio 5 live I'm shell-shocked and so are the Spurs players. It was three minutes of sheer madness - they were in total control in the first half. Juventus love defending. They defended for their lives and they saw the game out pretty well. Higuain took his chance when he got it and you have to say the second goal was beautifully worked. Spurs will feel unlucky, especially after that Harry Kane chance in the last minute. Pochettino is a dreamer, but this turned into a nightmare. They've been put out by a side who were cuter, more street-wise, and took their chances. Tottenham return to Premier League action on Sunday with an away game at Bournemouth (16:00 GMT kick-off) and then play at Swansea in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup on Saturday, 17 March (12:15). Juventus, second in Serie A, play at home to Udinese on Sunday (14:00) and then against Atalanta on Wednesday, 14 March. Line-ups\nMatch Stats\nLive Text\nMatch ends, Tottenham Hotspur 1, Juventus 2.

        "content": "Sex sells. It's an old mantra, but one which the car industry has been wedded to for many years. Since the 1960s and 70s, it has been common at the major motor shows to see models next to the latest shiny machinery. Here in Geneva this year, there are perhaps fewer models on the stands than there have been in the past - but they are still very visible. So in the 21st Century, in the age of #MeToo, what are we to make of such attitudes? I thought I'd ask some of the women who work at the show. If you've never been to one of these events before, there are a few things to bear in mind. Firstly, the clientele on the press and trade days is very masculine. Men in suits are the dominant breed. That seems to reflect the makeup of an industry in which only two mainstream CEOs are women; Mary Barra at General Motors and Citroen's Linda Jackson. However, there are lots of women working here. Many of them are hostesses, employed to welcome clients onto the stands, and provide information on the cars to inquisitive passers-by. Their role is very different to that of the models. Their dress is generally smart, but businesslike, their demeanour is affable - and they are formidably well-informed about the cars they look after. There are male hosts as well, but they are a lot harder to find. Wandering around the show, I met Julia - an Italian student, here to earn some money while she works towards a degree in international relations. Her job at the show is to take pictures of showgoers next to a classic car, in front of an advertising hoarding. I ask her what she thinks of the glamour models. \"It's not a good situation right now to find women like this,\" she says. \"But at the same time, women are responsible for themselves, they made their choice\" She also told me comfort was important - she thought people should not be asked to wear high heels for long periods, for example. I'm no expert, but some of the outfits worn by the models here certainly don't look designed for comfort. A little later, while filming on David Brown Automotive's stand, I speak to Michelle Gay. She is the marketing director for the company - a specialist manufacturer which creates exquisite designs that hark back to classic cars of the 1960s. But occasionally customers ask her to pose for photos in front of its products, something she says she does not really appreciate. Ms Gay thinks people should be looking at beautiful cars, rather than beautiful people - and car companies should use experts to draw attention to their creations. \"Ideally you go for knowledgeable people, people that can talk about the products\", she says. \"Everybody's here to see cars. People should be here talking about the cars, and not looking for nice things that are there to look at, that aren't cars!\" But Anna Vinson disagrees. She's a Youtuber - and has come to the show to gather material for her channel, Girl on Swiss Roads. \"I was a glamour model myself, when I was very, very young\", she tells me. \"I actually quite like it. I think the cars look beautiful, but I think you need a little bit extra to bring them to life\" Anna thinks it is possible to be just too politically correct. \"It's not about treating women like a piece of meat - I disagree with that. I'm a woman, and I like seeing beautiful women myself\", she says. \"I think they add a nice bit of spice\". There's no question that female models do attract a great deal of attention at car shows. The stands where they are striking poses are invariably surrounded by photographers, in a way that others are not. For smaller manufacturers and niche operators, that kind of attention can be very valuable. For mainstream carmakers it's different. It was always hard to see how sitting a supermodel on the bonnet of an uninspiring sedan could hope to improve sales. This week, the bosses of a handful of major manufacturers told me they no longer had any use for female models on their stands. But without a doubt, some exotic brands still try to sell a classic masculine fantasy. Get the (very expensive) car, and you'll get the girl. It seems sexism, for some, can still be very profitable. And it's hard to see that changing. ",

        "content": "Brexit should not overshadow plans to boost growth, a business lobby group conference will be told on Thursday. The biggest challenges facing businesses in the UK are to do with \"fundamentals\" rather than Brexit, the British Chambers of Commerce says. The UK government said it was committed to its industrial strategy and boosting productivity. Policy makers have wrestled with low UK productivity growth since the financial crisis. In a speech to a BCC conference in London, its director general, Adam Marshall, is due to say: \"Successive governments have acknowledged that more could be done to get the basics right for business. \"Indeed, the current government's developing industrial strategy is upfront about many of these challenges. \"Yet the leadership and the infrastructure simply aren't there to make change happen.\" The BCC will call on the government to fund repairs on local roads, improve the capacity of railways and airports, build more houses, get rid of of mobile phone \"not-spots\", make the apprenticeship system stable and come up with a clear and easy-to-use immigration system. Mr Marshall will also say that \"business communities are worried about\" policies being put forward by the Labour leadership, particularly nationalisation. The comments of Mr Marshall echo earlier BCC calls for clarity of leadership. A Department for Business, Energy and Industry Strategy spokesperson said: \"The government's commitment to boosting the productivity and earning power of people and places across the UK remains steadfast. \"Through our industrial strategy, we are building a Britain fit for the future, with a plan to help businesses create better, higher-paying jobs in every part of the UK.\" It said its \u00a31.7bn Transforming Cities Fund will \"address weaknesses in city transport systems while improving connectivity, reducing congestion and introducing new mobility services and technology\". The spokesperson added that the government had committed to raising research and development investment to 2.4% of GDP by 2027 \"ensuring our world-class research and innovation base continues to thrive\". The UK government is in continuing discussions with the European Union about Brexit. On Wednesday, the EU rejected a UK argument that financial services should be included in a free-trade agreement.

        "content": "South Africa's Rivonia Trial, which saw the imprisonment of anti-apartheid activists including Nelson Mandela, has taken on huge significance in the story of the country's struggle for freedom. Now, more than 60 years later, all of the roughly 300 hours of proceedings are available to listen to for the first time. The BBC's Gavin Fischer, who has a personal connection to the trial, looks at what the tapes can reveal about the \"trial that changed a nation\". The Rivonia Trial, lasting from October 1963 to June 1964, has been well documented as a pivotal point in the fight against the white minority government in South Africa. It brought Nelson Mandela to the world stage. His famous speech from the dock, declaring that freedom and equality was \"an ideal for which I am prepared to die\", became a rallying cry for black people under the apartheid regime, and set the young lawyer on a path to become the country's first democratically elected president 30 years later. It could have been very different. Mandela and his co-accused faced the death penalty for acts of sabotage against the state. It was my great uncle, Bram Fischer, who led their defence team, and was part of saving their lives. He took great risks in getting involved, as he was also an anti-apartheid activist who could have been in the dock at the Rivonia Trial. More myth than man to me\nIn fact, just a few years later, he too would be arrested and sentenced to life in prison. Seen as a traitor to his own white, Afrikaner people, he was badly mistreated and died while still in custody in 1975, before I was born. But by being given access to the newly digitised tapes from the Rivonia Trial, I have been able to go back to a time before tragedy overtook Bram's life. It's been my first chance to hear him speak. Polite to all he addresses, his calm tones are shot through with a seam of fierce authority. Eyes shut and headphones on, I listen. For the first time my great uncle, who has been more myth than man to me, starts to become real. The Rivonia Trial is itself now steeped in a kind of myth, part of the great story of South Africa's journey to freedom. The new recordings give the opportunity to hear some of the journey's most famous moments. There's the searing power of Mandela's speech, Walter Sisulu's impressive philosophical outwitting of the prosecutor, Elias Motsoaledi's humble but striking detailing of the life of black people in South Africa, and even the defiant humour of Ahmed Kathrada and Denis Goldberg. Immersing myself in the recordings, I've been able to forget the historical significance of these moments and simply be overawed by them. Not knowing what the future held, these men didn't beg for clemency or deny their actions, they used the trial to highlight the injustice being perpetrated by the government. To hear them speak is a privilege. I have also found myself getting lost in some of the trial's more mundane moments: The background chatter, the scraping of chairs, the thuds and silences as the recording equipment is adjusted. I revel in it all as the sounds swell and fall, pulling me back to that time. Then, from the midst of the crackle and hiss of the recordings, come moments of startling resonance I never knew existed and which are rarely documented in the story of the Rivonia Trial. Thomas Mashifane was a state witness, tortured into giving evidence against the accused. He had worked at a farm called Liliesleaf in Johannesburg, which Mandela and others had used as a hideout. He knew nothing of their activities, and his testimony is filled with innocuous detail, irrelevant to the case. Yet, at its end, he speaks up, unprompted, about being beaten and humiliated by the police. I can't breathe for the horror of it. I want to shrink from what white people did back then; but I also want to run over and hug him for forcing the court to hear what really happened. When I get to that moment, I have to take my headphones off, I just cannot sit in that courtroom any more. Weeks later, I meet Mr Mashifane's daughter Elizabeth. She's kind, though her manner is distant, hardened in preparation for reliving her father's ordeal. But as I play her the tape, this strength seems to drain away. It's the first time she has ever heard this testimony. \"It makes me feel like it happened yesterday,\" she tells me. As she listens, Elizabeth looks away from me, lost in her father's words. I try to fill the silence that follows, searching for something - anything - positive to say. I end up asking if she is proud of the fact that he spoke up. For a moment, her eyes turn back to me. \"But did it make any difference?\" she asks. No answer is necessary. Turning away again, she says more quietly: \"None of them were treated like humans.\" Thwadi Makena was also a labourer at Liliesleaf, and the only one left alive today. When I meet him, he strikes me as a quiet, humble man. Yet, as I play him the tape of himself giving evidence, Mr Makena's thin face comes alive and he chuckles with delight. \"I feel very excited to hear my voice after so many years. It's just so amazing - I can't believe it,\" he tells me. As with most of those I have spoken to, recalling details of the case turns Mr Makena's mood more sombre. He was held by police, made to feel like a criminal and says the impact it had remains to this day. \"I tend to feel they might come back and say some new information has been revealed and [I] need to come and make some confession,\" he says. \"That fear has always been there.\" Not an end, but a beginning\nWhile the recordings contain details which can bring back difficult memories, in playing them to those closest to the trial, I have found all have appreciated the chance to hear voices they thought lost forever. It is clear even short snippets of tape can help reclaim these stories from the dehumanising mass of the apartheid state. Laws may have changed since democracy was won, but grinding structural injustice remains a reality for so many South Africans. I too often lose these individuals' stories in an effort to find sense in the state of this country. The more tales of poverty I hear, the less I understand the cause or the solution. So these tapes have a lesson for me: Don't become numb. Listening is at least a start. There is no chance to hear the verdicts of the trial. Those tapes haven't been found. Maybe we'll never hear the moments when the judge showed what little mercy he could find, in the law and in himself, sentencing all the accused to life in prison. Life, not death. Not an end, but a beginning. Maybe even the beginning of a new chapter in the country's history. But as the audio plays, that story is still in the future. The tapes fuzz and hiss and you can sense the tension of what might come to pass. In these moments, the Rivonia Trial feels not so much of the past, but of the present. As I listen, my great uncle is still alive and the people around me suffer, fight and survive, not knowing what their future holds. ",

        "content": "Media playback is not supported on this device When it comes to equality in sport, the struggle continues for sportswomen the world over. According to recent studies, they are often paid less and receive less media exposure - but those wider issues aside, how can individual sports be made more equal? As part of International Women's Day campaign #pressforprogress, we asked eight top sportswomen what changes they wanted to see in their respective fields. You can join the debate by telling us how you would change your sport via this link: https://ssl.bbc.co.uk/sport/contact I think women deserve a little more equal play time on the centre courts outside of the marquee players. I think women work really hard and deserve that respect. Outside of some marquee players - which is just a handful - it's almost, 'the women's matches are at this time and the men's matches are at the more marquee times'. I think Wimbledon are getting better with that, and I definitely applaud them - but there's obviously lots of progress all the tournaments could still be making. In netball, there are so many fantastic ways for women and girls to get involved in the sport at the grassroots level, but when it comes to our elite sides, we need to continue pushing to make our women become professional athletes. There is lots being said around equal pay in other sports. Unlike most, we don't have a men's game to compare to but we do know that our athletes need a fair professional wage which would allow them to concentrate on becoming the best netballers in the world. A major part of this comes down to media coverage. Netball - and women's sport in general - needs a more prominent role in the sports press and broadcasting. This would encourage sponsors and investors to put more investment into our game and therefore allow our elite athletes to become professional. I'd like to change the types of tees women and men play from. The red tees are known as the ladies' tees and the men play off the yellow or white tees. I still think there should be the same difference in tee positions, but instead of grouping them by whether you're male or female you should play off whichever tee suits your ability. I used to play off the white tees with the boys when I was younger and it made me a better player. We need more acceptance of women's football on a global scale - both being seen as equals by men and having men, women, girls and boys promote women's football and accept us in the sport. I feel like I have an amazing opportunity since I was a young girl to play this sport and do it in an all-girls team - but that's not always the case around the world. I've seen so much progress only over the past 10 years since I've been with this team. I continue to see it making strides and national teams striving for equal payment and treatment. When I meet someone and tell them I play cricket, they say: \"You get paid for that?\" That's one of the biggest barriers - that people don't see it as a career choice. Having to explain it is my job can be quite difficult sometimes. The growth of the game has been exceptional but there is a long way to go to get that recognition and parity in terms of the way people think about cricket. The kind of recognition and support for the sport needs to improve throughout the world. Media playback is not supported on this device The great thing about Olympic sports is that funding is the same whether you are male or female, but I do think longevity in the sport is easier for men than women. I'd love to have an event in which the push isn't counted, so that we're lying down at the point of start. That would mean the women could compete against the men. I feel that down times are much better for the men, but that's only because men are able to run faster, so I'd quite like a race that actually pitches men and women together to see how we'd compare. I think women would do absolutely fantastically. Horse racing is a sport you can't do off your own back. Your biggest partner is your horse, and the hardest thing is to get on the best horse. So in terms of female barriers, maybe it takes more time for women to get there. I have been riding since the age of four, but it has taken me a bit longer than some of the lads. They get going at 16 or 17 and I'm 22, but I wouldn't change my past because the time I've taken to get here has made me stronger. You have to be good enough to do it, whether you are a boy or girl, and our sport is very different. There are a lot of people involved and a lot of people you have to convince - and show you have good enough ability. If you have talent you will get there, and the time it takes to get noticed is shortening. The biggest challenge for cycling is how many women take it up. There are still fewer girls that take it up than boys and I want to see that change, but the number of girls taking up cycling is growing faster than the number of men taking it up. Cycling is far more than just about racing. It's a fantastic sport, it's good for your health, it's fun and it gets you places. A bicycle is an amazing tool of empowerment for people of any gender. There are lots of countries in the world where girls don't have time to go to school because they have chores and school is a long walk away. There are charities which can help give girls and boys access to bikes so they can get to school far quicker. In our country we are privileged - most people can save up for a bike but not everyone can and that's something we should remember. ",

        "content": "Save the Children failed to deal adequately with inappropriate behaviour complaints and there was evidence of \"unsafe behaviour\" at the charity, two reviews have said. The reviews in 2015 found there were \"significant failures\" in the HR response to the informal complaints. The charity said progress had since been made in its workplace culture. Save the Children published its recommendations on Wednesday after the BBC revealed the failures. Staff complaints prompted the reviews in 2015. \"We have chosen to make both sets of recommendations public to ensure there is a full picture of the situation at the time and the actions taken since,\" Save the Children said. The BBC reported on Wednesday that the documents said the charity failed adequately to deal with allegations against its ex-chief executive Justin Forsyth. One of the 2015 reports, leaked to Radio 4's PM programme, referred to concerns that the then chairman Sir Alan Parker's \"very close\" relationship with Mr Forsyth may have affected how he responded to complaints. Three women employees accused Mr Forsyth of inappropriate behaviour, for which he said he had apologised. Sir Alan said he had nothing to add. A leaked email from the time cautioned that Mr Forsyth should not be alone with female employees. Mr Forsyth said that he had taken \"responsibility\" for his mistakes \"many years ago\", but did \"not accept as accurate much of what has been reported today, either in tone or fact\". He said he \"strongly refutes a number of the claims\" and added that he had not seen the 2015 report. 'Significant omissions'\nThe review in relation to historical complaints found a management culture existed that \"did not sufficiently adhere to established and published policies and procedures\". There were \"significant omissions and failures\" in the HR response to historical informal complaints around behaviour and the charity \"failed in its obligation to adequately deal with issues raised in respect of inappropriate behaviour through its disciplinary procedures\". But its policies and procedures were fit for purpose and the omissions and failures \"did not necessarily alter the outcome\", it said. The review on its culture found there were \"significant employee engagement issues\". \"There was evidence of uncomfortable and/or unsafe behaviour towards colleagues,\" the report said. But the charity, overall, had \"a positive workplace culture\". In the leaked report, a complainant claims Save the Children told her not to tell anyone about her case and that both her and Mr Forsyth's reputations were at risk. \"They weren't trying to protect me or safeguard any other women. It was just about covering this up as quickly as they could,\" she said. The report - by law firm Lewis Silkin - was written in October 2015. Months later, Save the Children provided a reference for Mr Forsyth when he applied for a job at UNICEF, which made no mention of the complaints. In a separate leaked email in 2015, a senior staff member said that allegations of sexual harassment made against Mr Forsyth were \"not being treated with the appropriate degree of seriousness\" and that \"he should not be unaccompanied with female members of staff\" until they could be sure his behaviour would not be repeated. The senior staff member wrote that they had no confidence in Sir Alan Parker's handling of the complaints, saying he had \"made a deliberate choice\u2026not to fully investigate these allegations\" and as a result had a \"conflict of interest\" in relation to the review. 'Whistle-blowing hotline'\nIn the review's recommendations, now published by the charity, it was advised to implement department plans to \"strengthen culture\". It said there should be annual interactive group training for staff, training for the HR department and an anonymous whistle-blowing hotline introduced. Since 2015, Save the Children said every staff member received training in \"respect in the workplace\" and a hotline has been set up. Senior leadership workshops have taken place specifically addressing standards of good, acceptable behaviour and culture in the workplace, the charity said. New recruits also now receive coaching and advice on the values of the organisation. Save the Children UK said a new review of workplace ethics would ensure that what caused previous claimants hurt \"cannot be repeated\". Ethics expert Dr Suzanne Shale, who is leading the independent review for the charity, said she \"acknowledges that past events may have caused distress to staff, and disquiet amongst those who support the work of the charity. We will listen to those accounts very carefully and with utmost consideration\". Last month, the BBC revealed Mr Forsyth faced three complaints of inappropriate behaviour towards female staff before leaving Save the Children in 2015. Days later, Mr Forsyth resigned from his role as deputy director of UNICEF, saying he did not want coverage of his past to \"damage\" the charities. ",

        "content": "New gun control measures for Florida have passed another legal hurdle, weeks after one of the worst school shootings in US history. The state's House of Representatives passed a bill raising the age to buy a gun from 18 to 21 and imposing a three-day waiting period on all gun sales. The bill, already passed by the Senate, now goes to the state governor. Seventeen people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on 14 February. Since the shooting, many surviving students have lobbied politicians for greater gun control. State lawmakers debated the bill for about eight hours on Wednesday before voting 67-50 in favour. The bill does not include a ban on the sale of assault-style weapons, despite it being a key demand of students and their parents. The new legislation allows the arming of some public school personnel, although classroom teachers are exempted. The voluntary armed \"marshals\" programme for schools in Florida was named after Aaron Feis, a coach who died in the Parkland shooting. It allows school staff who do not teach in classrooms to be armed, subject to school district approval and specialist training. The exemption of classroom teachers was deemed necessary to get the bill passed. A spokeswoman for Florida Governor Rick Scott said earlier this week that he had not yet decided whether to support the new measures. The bill, known as the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act, will automatically become law within 15 days unless he vetoes it. The US national minimum age to buy a handgun is already 21. Florida law already mandates a three-day waiting period before the purchase of a handgun is completed. However, a person as young as 18 can buy a rifle in Florida, with no waiting period. Police say expelled former student Nikolas Cruz was 18 when he legally bought the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle used in the attack. ",

        "content": "Football is one of the most popular female sports, with about 30 million girls and women playing it worldwide. But in several countries, girls are not allowed to play. In others, they are discriminated against. Even in football-crazy Brazil, women come up against a lot of challenges as Irene Caselli, Claudia Jardim and Mariangela Maturi found when they spoke to well-established and aspiring female footballers in Africa, Europe and Latin America. \"It was just me, a girl in the middle of a lot of boys,\" says Marta Vieira da Silva, the Brazilian football legend who is better known just as Marta. Not only does she hold the record for the most goals scored at the Women's World Cup, she is also the only woman to have been named the world's best female footballer five times. Nevertheless, Marta says she did not have an easy time of it starting out in football. \"My family didn't approve. They didn't accept it because people still thought that girls weren't allowed to play football,\" she recalls. 'Incompatible with women's nature'\nMarta was born in 1986, seven years after a government-imposed ban on women practicing sports \"incompatible with their nature\" was lifted. The ban had been in place from 1941 until 1979 and clearly influenced the way even players regarded women. In the year that the ban was lifted, Pel\u00e9 told a local paper that football \"can be a hobby, but not a real sport for women\". It comes as little surprise that prejudice and stereotypes remained even after the ban was lifted. Born in Dois Riachos, a small town in the poor state of Alagoas in north-eastern Brazil, Marta had to struggle to be recognised. Brought up by her mother after her parents separated when she was only one, she learned to play football with the boys in the streets of her hometown. If her older brother approached, she would hide, afraid he might punish her for playing a \"men's game\". She eventually joined a club but says that as late as 1999 she was banned from playing in a tournament because she was a girl. \"I was very frustrated at that moment. I looked around, I stopped to think, and I just couldn't understand it,\" she recalls. \"Why is it so hard to accept that a human being was born with a talent, knows how to play, wants to do it and that is what makes her happy?\" Cultural stereotypes are not limited to Brazil either. And despite women like Marta making it big, young female players in Brazil still struggle. 'Absurd rules'\nLaura Pigatin, 14, is serious and disciplined and fully dedicated to achieving her dream of becoming a professional footballer. She trains several times a week, both in futsal and football. Since there are no female teams of her age group in her hometown of S\u00e3o Carlos, she plays in the all-boys team. Two years ago her team qualified for the championship in S\u00e3o Paulo state but state officials banned Laura from playing because they said that the tournament was only for boys. Eventually the authorities caved in and Laura was allowed to play after a campaign led by her parents gathered momentum. But it proved to be a fleeting victory as Laura was again banned from playing in the second phase of the tournament in 2017. \"I was very sad because I helped the team to be champion in the first phase and I was not going to be able to play the second phase, which was more important,\" Laura says. \"Marta's story is more or less similar to mine. Since then, things should have changed, and it should be allowed for girls to be able to play. It's absurd.\" Making do\nBut change has been slow. Since the 1980s, few resources have been dedicated to women's football in Brazil. Several national tournaments were discontinued, and female players earn so little they often have to work another job. Brazil's national women's football league was launched as recently as 2013 and even top teams are severely underfunded. Rio Preto Esporte Club won the national women's league in 2015 and the S\u00e3o Paulo championship in 2016 and 2017. The ground they train on is full of holes where ants have built their nests. They have no dedicated coach with a senior player taking on coaching duties instead. The players all live in a house provided by the club's owners with five of them to a room as their 1,500-reais monthly scholarships (\u00a3330, US$460) do not stretch to more. Going abroad to make it\nDespite Brazilians' love of football, the best female players move abroad to make their career at foreign clubs. Marta, for example, moved to Sweden at age 18 and now holds dual nationality. Despite her many achievements, in Brazil she is often referred to as \"Pel\u00e9 in a skirt\". \"There is always a comparison between her and Pel\u00e9, even though Marta scored more goals for the national team,\" says Angelica Souza of Dibradoras, a Brazilian website dedicated to women's sport. \"She's a woman so she'll always be compared to a man, she'll always be 'Pel\u00e9 in a skirt', rather than Pel\u00e9 being known as 'Marta in trousers'.\" Fifa's chief women's football officer Sarai Bareman says what is needed are more role models. \"In South America, there is a negative perception for young girls trying to get into the game,\" she says. Role models have worked in some countries, such as Denmark where Nadia Nadim is inspiring girls from different ethnic backgrounds to play football. Marta says there is no magic wand to bring about change. \"We have to do it by fighting, doing our job in the best possible way by showing people that women's football is possible,\" she says. \"Women's and men's football are the same thing: the field is the same, the ball is the same, there is the same desire to do your best, setting an example to continue inspiring the children, so that the new generations can accept it in a natural way.\" To hear more about A Girls' Game and to listen to interviews with aspiring and well-established female players, tune in to Outlook on the BBC World Service or go to the programme page.

        "content": "Tottenham's Champions League ambitions came crashing down as Juventus produced two goals inside three second-half minutes to decide the destiny of their last-16 tie. Son Heung-min's scrambled finish six minutes before the interval strengthened Spurs' position at Wembley after they recovered from two goals down to draw the first leg in Turin 2-2. In an eventful first 45 minutes, Son and Harry Kane had wasted chances for the hosts, while Juventus were denied a clear penalty when Douglas Costa was brought down by Jan Vertonghen. Tottenham appeared to be in control until Gonzalo Higuain turned in Sami Khedira's flick to give Juventus a 64th-minute lifeline - which they capitalised on ruthlessly and Paulo Dybala raced clear for the decisive goal three minutes later. Mauricio Pochettino's side fought to revive their chances but to no avail, coming agonisingly close in the dying moments when Kane's header hit the inside of the post but bounced right on the goal-line. For Spurs, who last reached the Champions League quarter-finals in 2010-11, it was a first defeat in 18 matches, while Juventus are unbeaten since 22 November - a run of 20 games. The London club are the first English team to be eliminated from this season's Champions League. Elsewhere on Wednesday, Manchester City lost 2-1 to Basel but went through 5-2 aggregate win to join Liverpool in the quarter-finals. Manchester United and Chelsea could make it four Premier League sides in the last eight of Europe's top club competition when they play the second legs of their ties next week. United entertain Sevilla on Tuesday following a goalless first leg in Spain, before Chelsea play at Barcelona on Wednesday after it finished 1-1 at Stamford Bridge. Pochettino has performed outstanding work in piecing together an exciting and talented Tottenham team - but familiar questions will be asked after this devastating loss. Spurs showed maturity as well as excellence to come from two goals down to earn a draw in Turin in the first leg, putting themselves in a favourable position to finish the job and secure a place in the quarter-finals. And yet, from a position of strength bolstered even further by Son's goal just before the interval, Spurs once again came up short. There is no doubting the quality in this Tottenham side and they were excellent in spells at Wembley, but with two Premier League title campaigns promising much but unable to deliver and an FA Cup semi-final loss to Chelsea last season, the requirement for tangible success is intensifying. The hosts missed chances and suffered ill luck in the closing moments when Kane's header somehow stayed out, but in the end they paid a heavy price for three minutes of slackness that undid all the fine work from the first leg. The best sides back up quality with trophies. Spurs now need the FA Cup this season. Juventus could have been forgiven for believing luck was against them when referee Szymon Marciniak and his assistant somehow failed to penalise Vertonghen for a first-half challenge on Costa in the area. They had been put under pressure by Spurs and survived a succession of near misses - but showed their ruthlessness to deliver those two devastating blows and then the resilience to fiercely protect their advantage. Juventus have a streak of experience a mile wide through the core of Massimiliano Allegri's side and it was epitomised when the old firm of keeper Gianluigi Buffon and Giorgio Chiellini celebrated as if a goal had been scored after the veteran defender made a crucial clearance late on. And for Buffon, who has previously said he will conclude a glittering career if Juve fail to win the Champions League this season, the dream lives on. Son's outstanding season continued as he scored the goal that put Spurs in control of this tie until they let it slip from their grasp. The South Korea international has now scored 16 goals in 42 games this term and been involved in 25 goals in total, testimony to his growing influence. And yet it could have been even better. He forced an early save from Buffon and fired another good opportunity across the face of goal before scoring with a scuffed finish. Son was inches off target late on as Spurs pressed - his performance mirroring that of his team on a night when they got plenty right but could not make the crucial moments count. Former Premier League striker Chris Sutton on BBC Radio 5 live I'm shell-shocked and so are the Spurs players. It was three minutes of sheer madness - they were in total control in the first half. Juventus love defending. They defended for their lives and they saw the game out pretty well. Higuain took his chance when he got it and you have to say the second goal was beautifully worked. Spurs will feel unlucky, especially after that Harry Kane chance in the last minute. Pochettino is a dreamer, but this turned into a nightmare. They've been put out by a side who were cuter, more street-wise, and took their chances. Tottenham return to Premier League action on Sunday with an away game at Bournemouth (16:00 GMT kick-off) and then play at Swansea in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup on Saturday, 17 March (12:15). Juventus, second in Serie A, play at home to Udinese on Sunday (14:00) and then against Atalanta on Wednesday, 14 March. Line-ups\nMatch Stats\nLive Text\nMatch ends, Tottenham Hotspur 1, Juventus 2.

        "content": "Suspected domestic abusers could be electronically tagged under government proposals for England and Wales. Other measures in the draft Domestic Abuse Bill include tougher sentences for child abusers and more protection for victims who testify in court. There is a new definition of economic abuse - if people are denied access to jobs or money, or forced to take loans. Prime Minister Theresa May said the bill could \"completely transform the way we tackle domestic abuse\". Proposed Domestic Abuse Protection Orders (DAPOs) would allow police and courts to intervene earlier where abuse is suspected. The orders would allow courts to electronically monitor suspects' whereabouts before they have been found guilty of - or even committed - a crime. DAPOs would bring together elements from existing protective orders, while giving courts the power to set a wider range of restrictions and for longer periods than the current 28 days. Other measures being considered include: It is estimated that almost two million adults in England and Wales have been victims of domestic abuse in the past year while 95 women and men were killed by current or former partners in 2016-17. 'Radical change'\nHome Secretary Amber Rudd said: \"It is appalling that in 21st-Century Britain, nearly two million people every year - the majority of them women - suffer abuse at the hands of those closest to them. \"Through this bill I want to fundamentally change the way we as a country think about domestic abuse, recognising that it is a crime that comes in many forms - physical, emotional, economic.\" Suzanne Jacob, chief executive of domestic abuse charity SafeLives, said: \"We welcome the focus on the urgent need to hold perpetrators to account and to prioritise the needs and safety of women and girls. \"The time for piecemeal sticking plasters is over, we need radical change.\" Katie Ghose, chief executive of Women's Aid, said the bill was an opportunity to \"include policies on housing, education, health, immigration and the welfare system... to ensure that every survivor and her child can safely escape domestic abuse\". But she cautioned the the \"ambition will be undermined if there is not a long-term, sustainable funding plan for refuges in place\". The consultation period for the draft bill will run until 31 May.

        "content": "Media playback is not supported on this device England lost to the United States in the SheBelieves Cup finale and missed out on winning the competition. Phil Neville's Lionesses needed one point against the hosts in Orlando to clinch the four-team tournament on goal difference - but lost to Karen Bardsley's second-half own goal. The breakthrough came when Mille Bright's sliced clearance hit keeper Bardsley and went into the net. Ellen White almost equalised late on but her header hit the post. Neville was looking to win the invitational tournament in his first three games as a first-team senior manager. A 4-1 victory over France was followed by a 2-2 draw against Olympic champions Germany. The comprehensive win over France meant they just needed to draw against the USA to edge them on goal difference. For about 40 minutes they were the match of the Americans, but then the quality started to tell late in the first half and continued after the break. Megan Rapinoe and Mallory Pugh both forced saves from Bardsley, with teenager Pugh also hitting the outside of the post following a mazy run. Their goal came when Rapinoe's cross hit Abbie McManus and then Bright's clearance went in off her keeper. Neville brought on Toni Duggan and Nikita Parris and both players had chances, with Duggan curling wide from 20 yards and Parris forcing a save.

        "content": "Women are more likely than men to be affected by climate change, studies show. UN figures indicate that 80% of people displaced by climate change are women. Roles as primary caregivers and providers of food and fuel make them more vulnerable when flooding and drought occur. The 2015 Paris Agreement has made specific provision for the empowerment of women, recognising that they are disproportionately impacted. In central Africa, where up to 90% of Lake Chad has disappeared, nomadic indigenous groups are particularly at risk. As the lake's shoreline recedes, women have to walk much further to collect water. \"In the dry season, men go to the towns... leaving women to look after the community,\" explains Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, coordinator of the Association of Indigenous Women and People of Chad (AFPAT). With dry seasons now becoming longer, women are working harder to feed and care for their families without support. \"They become more vulnerable... it's very hard work,\" Ibrahim recently told the BBC's 100 Women initiative. A global problem\nIt is not just women in rural areas who are affected. Globally, women are more likely to experience poverty, and to have less socioeconomic power than men. This makes it difficult to recover from disasters which affect infrastructure, jobs and housing. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, African American women were among the worst affected by flooding in Louisiana. As sea levels rise, low-lying cities like New Orleans will be increasingly at risk. \"In New Orleans, there was much higher poverty among the African American population before Katrina,\" says Jacquelyn Litt, professor of women's and gender studies at Rutgers University. \"More than half the poor families in the city were headed by single mothers,\" she told BBC News. \"[They] are reliant on interdependent community networks for their everyday survival and resources. The displacement that happened after Katrina essentially eroded those networks. It places women and their children at much greater risk.\" In the immediate aftermath of extreme events, emergency shelters can be inadequately equipped to support women. The Superdome, in which evacuees were temporarily housed after Hurricane Katrina, didn't have enough sanitary products for the women accommodated there. Increased incidences of violence against women, including sexual assault and rape, have also been documented in the wake of disasters. 'Natural' disasters?\nMuch as climate change is accelerated by human behaviours, the impact of weather and climate events is influenced by societal structures. Disasters do not affect all people equally. In the wake of the 2004 tsunami, an Oxfam report found that surviving men outnumbered women by almost 3:1 in Sri Lanka, Indonesia and India. While no one cause was clear, there were similar patterns across the region. Men were more likely to be able to swim, and women lost precious evacuation time trying to look after children and other relatives. Another study spanning 20 years noted that catastrophic events lowered women's life expectancy more than men; more women were being killed, or they were being killed younger. In countries where women had greater socioeconomic power, the difference reduced. Half the world\nIn recognition of this vast disparity, governments and organisations working on climate change are gradually moving to include women's voices in policy and planning. The UN has highlighted the need for gender sensitive responses to the impacts of climate change, yet the average representation of women in national and global climate negotiating bodies is below 30%. The numbers don't improve at the local level. \"Women are often not involved in the decisions made about the responses to climate change, so the money ends up going to the men rather than the women,\" environmental scientist Diana Liverman told the BBC's Science in Action programme on the World Service this week. As an author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), whose reports influence climate change policy, Liverman has been monitoring the numbers of women involved. Twenty-five percent of those nominated to participate in the next report are women. \"IPCC has been very receptive to this and is actually discussing how they can support women better,\" explains Liverman. \"Women are half the world. It's important they participate in all major decisions,\" \"Climate change is not a fight for power,\" points out Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, \"it's a fight for survival.\" ",

        "content": "Danish inventor Peter Madsen is due to go on trial over the death of Swedish journalist Kim Wall aboard his homemade submarine last August. He faces charges including murder, dismemberment and \"sexual relations other than intercourse of a particularly dangerous nature\". He denies murdering her after she boarded the vessel in pursuit of a story, but admits cutting up her body. Around 40 witnesses are set to give evidence over the next few weeks. Prosecutors will attempt to fill in the gaps in an already horrific jigsaw puzzle of details surrounding the 30-year-old's death, says the BBC's Maddy Savage in Copenhagen. A cyclist found the remains of the journalist's dismembered torso on a nearby beach 10 days after she disappeared following an interview with Peter Madsen on his submarine. Weeks later, police divers discovered other parts of her body in plastic bags weighed down with metal. Mr Madsen told police she had died when a heavy hatch on the submarine fell on her head. However, he later changed this account and maintained she had been killed by carbon monoxide poisoning inside the submarine while he was up on deck. If he is found guilty Peter Madsen, 47, is likely to get a life sentence - typically meaning around 15 to 17 years in prison without parole - or be sent to a secure psychiatric hospital. Ms Wall had had a long career in journalism, having previously reported from North Korea, the South Pacific, Uganda and Haiti, writing for the New York Times, Guardian, Vice and the South China Morning Post.

It is their best ever finish. Their performance against France was excellent, their resilience against Germany and at times they created against USA tonight. It's positive for England moving forward. Just think about the players England are missing too. Without those players, they have still managed to compete with some of the best teams in the world. England were very well organised and created chances. I thought Ellen White had equalised. But that's two sloppy defensive goals they've conceded. They'll look at this game and reflect and think: 'What do we have to improve on to beat the world champions?' It'll be cutting out defensive errors. England are next in action on 6 April when they play Women's World Cup qualifying group one leaders Wales in Southampton. The Lionesses have won their opening three qualifying matches and are trying to secure their place at the main competition in France next year.

        "content": "Adults who move back home after moving away are causing their parents stress and conflict, a study suggests. Parents' whose adult children move back into the family home saw a decline in their quality of life and wellbeing, researchers at the London School of Economics and Political Science found. The research analysed data from people aged between 50 and 75 from 17 European countries, not including the UK. They found parents' quality of life fell when an adult child \"boomeranged.\" The study found that this slump in wellbeing happened only when there were no other children still at home - there was no impact on parents if other children were already living in the family home. 'Empty nest'\nResearchers measured quality of life and wellbeing across four areas: Higher scores indicated a better quality of life. The study found that when a child returned home to an \"empty-nest\", scores fell by an average of 0.8 points. It said such a drop had a substantial effect on quality of life and was similar to developing an age-related disability, such as difficulties with walking or getting dressed. The research paper, published in the journal Social Science & Medicine, says: \"Over the past half century, intergenerational co-residence has declined dramatically in Western countries. \"However, this pattern has recently altered, and in some countries multigenerational co-residence has increased; a shift interpreted as a family response to high unemployment rates, poor job prospects and financial hardship among young adults.\" The paper explores the effects of different reasons for returning home, such as unemployment and partnership breakdown, saying these are, in themselves, distressing to parents. But after controlling for this, the researchers found the return of a child still caused a significant decline in parents' wellbeing. The researchers assessed only adults up to the age of 75, to reduce the chance that returning home was driven by parents' need for support. The paper says: \"The findings show that returning home was correlated with a decline in parent's quality of life when there were no other children in the parental home. \"Parents enjoy their independence when their children leave the home, and refilling an empty nest may be regarded as a violation of this life-course stage.\" Study author Dr Marco Tosi said: \"Our work shows that in contexts where family orientations and welfare institutions foster individuals' independence, returns home by adult children have negative implications for parents' well-being. \"Across Europe, this effect is greater in Protestant than in Catholic countries, but we see it in all countries. \"When children leave the parental home, marital relationships improve and parents find a new equilibrium. \"They enjoy this stage in life, finding new hobbies and activities. When adult children move back, it is a violation of that equilibrium.\" Although the study did not cover the UK, it was highly likely that the trends would be very similar in the UK, Dr Tosi added, particularly as it was a predominantly Protestant country. The 17 countries covered by the research were: France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Luxembourg, Belgium, Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Estonia and Poland.

        "content": "Stefan Golaszewski has written two of the BBC's best-received sitcoms of recent years. Him & Her took viewers into the lives of 20-somethings Steve and Becky in their cramped flat in London. Mum - starring Oscar nominee Lesley Manville (Phantom Thread) - is pulling in viewers with its painfully tentative romance between recently widowed Cathy and old friend Michael. Golaszewski says an ambition is to change the way female characters are written on screen. He grew up in Chingford in London's north-eastern suburbs. So far, his work has strayed from there only rarely. Until its final series, Him & Her didn't move from the small flat the central characters shared in Walthamstow. The first two series of Mum have been set nearby, in leafier Chingford (though the show's exteriors are actually filmed in Croxley Green in Hertfordshire). At 37, Golaszewski has now become a Hertfordshire resident himself, moving recently to Harpenden with his wife and two small children. Golaszewski says he's often frustrated at how TV portrays female characters. \"After Him & Her four years ago I wrote a few other bits and pieces but I came back to the sitcom again. As a structure and a format it can contain a great deal of popular appeal. But by the nature of the subjects you explore it has the capacity for depth too. \"When I first started writing Him & Her I was interested in the structure of each episode but nowadays with Mum I'm more caught up in the structure of the whole series. I'm finding the longer arc much more interesting. \"One of the ideas behind Mum was that I think the way TV - and society generally - presents and regards women over a certain age didn't seem truthful. I wanted to look at someone who's reaching a stage in life where our culture would probably regard them as washed up. But why should they be? \"It's always bothered me and, in a different way, it was also there in the Becky character in Him & Her (played by Sarah Solemani). \"Becky was my deliberate attempt to portray a young woman who was sexually interested through desire not need. She has an active will which is in no way problematic. In fact it was often her boyfriend Steve (Russell Tovey) who could appear the less confident one. I was trying to undermine the traditional way that relationship might be written.\" Golaszewski says Mum (already recommissioned for its third and final series) tries to be realistic about falling in love. \"Whenever you watch a film or a drama, the truth is often short-changed essentially for the sake of plot. On screen people fall in love incredibly easily and incredibly quickly. Actually it's terribly difficult. But I'm interested in the minutiae of falling in love: I wanted to watch it happen in a glacial way.\" He says he always wanted Manville in the role of the woman who loses her husband in her 50s. \"I'd seen Lesley in the film Another Year (written and directed by Mike Leigh) and I was completely bowled over. When Lesley said yes we were able to build our superb cast around her. I know it's a cliche but while we're filming it's like we're a family.\" Most of the humour in the series doesn't come directly from Cathy or from Michael (played by Peter Mullan): there's a lurking tragedy in the way they seem incapable of expressing their powerful desire for one another. So far Cathy has stoically accepted her family's apparent blindness to her need for love. But Golaszewski says he always bears in mind the audience's expectations of comedy too. \"So some of Mum's other characters are deliberately written larger. You have the grandparents (played by Karl Johnson and Marlene Sidaway) who may show an edge of the grotesque. But as the story progresses I hope I explain the roots of some of the behaviour you see on screen.\" He also had another specific ambition with Mum. \"I really wanted to explore the relationship between a woman and her daughter-in-law. It's such a basic part of family life and a really interesting dynamic. But hardly anyone writes about it. \"For me it's important that my writing is about kindness and understanding. It's about the nuance of togetherness and not separation. I'm writing about things that bring us together.\" Half way through the arc of Mum, Golaszewski is keeping silent about what will happen in the final series, which he's busy writing. \"I sit down at nine to write, then go out and get some exercise at lunchtime. Then I write again until about 5.30. And I don't write at the weekends or bank holidays.\" With the final series of Him & Her he took the radical step of dropping the characters into a totally new situation - a hellish but utterly hilarious wedding ceremony with its chaotic build-up. But is he aware that with Mum some viewers are by now getting close to shouting at Cathy and Michael to get it together before it's all too late and the series ends? \"I lead a relatively hermetically sealed existence at home with my wife and kids. I'm always surprised to find anyone's watching at all. The cast is more recognisable of course and after series one they told me anecdotes about things people would say in the street. But you have to write what's in your own head.\" Golaszewski has also directed the current series of Mum. He says the BBC have been supportive in letting him pursue his vision. \"We were allowed to make a pilot episode of Mum, which is getting rare. I had a basic feeling where each of the characters will go and what the show is about. But a lot of the detail comes in the writing: I make notes in my phone as I'm walking about. \"When I wrote the first series of Him & Her I was 28. It was the first thing I'd written for telly and it was only by series three and four that I was starting to know which buttons to push. So now I don't panic so much if I find I can't do it. Some days I will look at what I wrote the day before and maybe I thought it was great but I realise it's terrible. \"In fact the reason something is unworkable is often what made it appear attractive in the first place. As a writer you can be seduced by concept. But concepts aren't very useful when you're trying to write the truth about human beings.\" Mum is on BBC Two on Tuesdays and is also available on BBC iPlayer.

        "content": "South Africa's Rivonia Trial, which saw the imprisonment of anti-apartheid activists including Nelson Mandela, has taken on huge significance in the story of the country's struggle for freedom. Now, more than 60 years later, all of the roughly 300 hours of proceedings are available to listen to for the first time. The BBC's Gavin Fischer, who has a personal connection to the trial, looks at what the tapes can reveal about the \"trial that changed a nation\". The Rivonia Trial, lasting from October 1963 to June 1964, has been well documented as a pivotal point in the fight against the white minority government in South Africa. It brought Nelson Mandela to the world stage. His famous speech from the dock, declaring that freedom and equality was \"an ideal for which I am prepared to die\", became a rallying cry for black people under the apartheid regime, and set the young lawyer on a path to become the country's first democratically elected president 30 years later. It could have been very different. Mandela and his co-accused faced the death penalty for acts of sabotage against the state. It was my great uncle, Bram Fischer, who led their defence team, and was part of saving their lives. He took great risks in getting involved, as he was also an anti-apartheid activist who could have been in the dock at the Rivonia Trial. More myth than man to me\nIn fact, just a few years later, he too would be arrested and sentenced to life in prison. Seen as a traitor to his own white, Afrikaner people, he was badly mistreated and died while still in custody in 1975, before I was born. But by being given access to the newly digitised tapes from the Rivonia Trial, I have been able to go back to a time before tragedy overtook Bram's life. It's been my first chance to hear him speak. Polite to all he addresses, his calm tones are shot through with a seam of fierce authority. Eyes shut and headphones on, I listen. For the first time my great uncle, who has been more myth than man to me, starts to become real. The Rivonia Trial is itself now steeped in a kind of myth, part of the great story of South Africa's journey to freedom. The new recordings give the opportunity to hear some of the journey's most famous moments. There's the searing power of Mandela's speech, Walter Sisulu's impressive philosophical outwitting of the prosecutor, Elias Motsoaledi's humble but striking detailing of the life of black people in South Africa, and even the defiant humour of Ahmed Kathrada and Denis Goldberg. Immersing myself in the recordings, I've been able to forget the historical significance of these moments and simply be overawed by them. Not knowing what the future held, these men didn't beg for clemency or deny their actions, they used the trial to highlight the injustice being perpetrated by the government. To hear them speak is a privilege. I have also found myself getting lost in some of the trial's more mundane moments: The background chatter, the scraping of chairs, the thuds and silences as the recording equipment is adjusted. I revel in it all as the sounds swell and fall, pulling me back to that time. Then, from the midst of the crackle and hiss of the recordings, come moments of startling resonance I never knew existed and which are rarely documented in the story of the Rivonia Trial. Thomas Mashifane was a state witness, tortured into giving evidence against the accused. He had worked at a farm called Liliesleaf in Johannesburg, which Mandela and others had used as a hideout. He knew nothing of their activities, and his testimony is filled with innocuous detail, irrelevant to the case. Yet, at its end, he speaks up, unprompted, about being beaten and humiliated by the police. I can't breathe for the horror of it. I want to shrink from what white people did back then; but I also want to run over and hug him for forcing the court to hear what really happened. When I get to that moment, I have to take my headphones off, I just cannot sit in that courtroom any more. Weeks later, I meet Mr Mashifane's daughter Elizabeth. She's kind, though her manner is distant, hardened in preparation for reliving her father's ordeal. But as I play her the tape, this strength seems to drain away. It's the first time she has ever heard this testimony. \"It makes me feel like it happened yesterday,\" she tells me. As she listens, Elizabeth looks away from me, lost in her father's words. I try to fill the silence that follows, searching for something - anything - positive to say. I end up asking if she is proud of the fact that he spoke up. For a moment, her eyes turn back to me. \"But did it make any difference?\" she asks. No answer is necessary. Turning away again, she says more quietly: \"None of them were treated like humans.\" Thwadi Makena was also a labourer at Liliesleaf, and the only one left alive today. When I meet him, he strikes me as a quiet, humble man. Yet, as I play him the tape of himself giving evidence, Mr Makena's thin face comes alive and he chuckles with delight. \"I feel very excited to hear my voice after so many years. It's just so amazing - I can't believe it,\" he tells me. As with most of those I have spoken to, recalling details of the case turns Mr Makena's mood more sombre. He was held by police, made to feel like a criminal and says the impact it had remains to this day. \"I tend to feel they might come back and say some new information has been revealed and [I] need to come and make some confession,\" he says. \"That fear has always been there.\" Not an end, but a beginning\nWhile the recordings contain details which can bring back difficult memories, in playing them to those closest to the trial, I have found all have appreciated the chance to hear voices they thought lost forever. It is clear even short snippets of tape can help reclaim these stories from the dehumanising mass of the apartheid state. Laws may have changed since democracy was won, but grinding structural injustice remains a reality for so many South Africans. I too often lose these individuals' stories in an effort to find sense in the state of this country. The more tales of poverty I hear, the less I understand the cause or the solution. So these tapes have a lesson for me: Don't become numb. Listening is at least a start. There is no chance to hear the verdicts of the trial. Those tapes haven't been found. Maybe we'll never hear the moments when the judge showed what little mercy he could find, in the law and in himself, sentencing all the accused to life in prison. Life, not death. Not an end, but a beginning. Maybe even the beginning of a new chapter in the country's history. But as the audio plays, that story is still in the future. The tapes fuzz and hiss and you can sense the tension of what might come to pass. In these moments, the Rivonia Trial feels not so much of the past, but of the present. As I listen, my great uncle is still alive and the people around me suffer, fight and survive, not knowing what their future holds. ",

        "content": "The White House says there could be exemptions to US plans to impose tariffs on metal imports, in a softening of its tough stance. Canada, Mexico and other countries may see \"carve-outs\" on national security grounds, a spokeswoman said. US President Donald Trump has said steel products will face a 25% tariff, with 10% on aluminium goods. Meanwhile, China threatened an \"appropriate and necessary response\" in any trade war with the US. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China and the US should strive to be partners rather than rivals. The EU has proposed retaliatory measures against a number of US goods including bourbon and peanut butter. Despite opposition at home and abroad, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the US president would sign the measures in by the end of the week, with US media reporting it could happen as early as Thursday. But she added: \"There are potential carve-outs for Mexico and Canada based on national security, and possibly other countries as well based on that process. That would be [on] a case-by-case and country by country basis.\" President Trump has previously suggested that planned tariffs for Canada and Mexico could be abandoned if a \"new and fair\" North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) is signed. Why is Mr Trump doing this?\nMr Trump has railed against the US trade deficit, arguing that other countries have been \"taking advantage of\" the US for decades. One of his campaign promises was to rebuild the US steel and aluminium industries which he said has suffered \"disgraceful\" treatment from other countries, in particular cheap Chinese imports. From Bush 1 to present, our Country has lost more than 55,000 factories, 6,000,000 manufacturing jobs and accumulated Trade Deficits of more than 12 Trillion Dollars. Last year we had a Trade Deficit of almost 800 Billion Dollars. Bad Policies & Leadership. Must WIN again! #MAGA End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump Last week he dismissed concerns he could trigger a trade war, instead saying \"trade wars are good\" and were something the US would easily win. Mr Trump has already hinted he could drop plans to impose tariffs on Mexican and Canadian metals but linked it to the US getting a better deal in the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Mexico and Canada are among the main suppliers of steel to the US. What's the reaction been?\nThe US plans have sparked worldwide alarm and jolted stock markets. Critics argue that the tariffs would fail to protect American jobs and would ultimately raise prices for consumers. International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde warned \"nobody wins\" in a trade war, saying it would harm global economic growth. The EU has set out tit-for-tat plans to impose import duties on bourbon, peanut butter, cranberries, orange juice, steel, and industrial products. Other countries are also considering retaliatory steps. Members of Mr Trump's Republican party are concerned too, with House Speaker Paul Ryan saying he wanted to see tariffs that were \"more surgical and more targeted\". Tuesday saw the departure of top White House economic advisor Gary Cohn, who is a strong supporter of free trade. ",

        "content": "Sex sells. It's an old mantra, but one which the car industry has been wedded to for many years. Since the 1960s and 70s, it has been common at the major motor shows to see models next to the latest shiny machinery. Here in Geneva this year, there are perhaps fewer models on the stands than there have been in the past - but they are still very visible. So in the 21st Century, in the age of #MeToo, what are we to make of such attitudes? I thought I'd ask some of the women who work at the show. If you've never been to one of these events before, there are a few things to bear in mind. Firstly, the clientele on the press and trade days is very masculine. Men in suits are the dominant breed. That seems to reflect the makeup of an industry in which only two mainstream CEOs are women; Mary Barra at General Motors and Citroen's Linda Jackson. However, there are lots of women working here. Many of them are hostesses, employed to welcome clients onto the stands, and provide information on the cars to inquisitive passers-by. Their role is very different to that of the models. Their dress is generally smart, but businesslike, their demeanour is affable - and they are formidably well-informed about the cars they look after. There are male hosts as well, but they are a lot harder to find. Wandering around the show, I met Julia - an Italian student, here to earn some money while she works towards a degree in international relations. Her job at the show is to take pictures of showgoers next to a classic car, in front of an advertising hoarding. I ask her what she thinks of the glamour models. \"It's not a good situation right now to find women like this,\" she says. \"But at the same time, women are responsible for themselves, they made their choice\" She also told me comfort was important - she thought people should not be asked to wear high heels for long periods, for example. I'm no expert, but some of the outfits worn by the models here certainly don't look designed for comfort. A little later, while filming on David Brown Automotive's stand, I speak to Michelle Gay. She is the marketing director for the company - a specialist manufacturer which creates exquisite designs that hark back to classic cars of the 1960s. But occasionally customers ask her to pose for photos in front of its products, something she says she does not really appreciate. Ms Gay thinks people should be looking at beautiful cars, rather than beautiful people - and car companies should use experts to draw attention to their creations. \"Ideally you go for knowledgeable people, people that can talk about the products\", she says. \"Everybody's here to see cars. People should be here talking about the cars, and not looking for nice things that are there to look at, that aren't cars!\" But Anna Vinson disagrees. She's a Youtuber - and has come to the show to gather material for her channel, Girl on Swiss Roads. \"I was a glamour model myself, when I was very, very young\", she tells me. \"I actually quite like it. I think the cars look beautiful, but I think you need a little bit extra to bring them to life\" Anna thinks it is possible to be just too politically correct. \"It's not about treating women like a piece of meat - I disagree with that. I'm a woman, and I like seeing beautiful women myself\", she says. \"I think they add a nice bit of spice\". There's no question that female models do attract a great deal of attention at car shows. The stands where they are striking poses are invariably surrounded by photographers, in a way that others are not. For smaller manufacturers and niche operators, that kind of attention can be very valuable. For mainstream carmakers it's different. It was always hard to see how sitting a supermodel on the bonnet of an uninspiring sedan could hope to improve sales. This week, the bosses of a handful of major manufacturers told me they no longer had any use for female models on their stands. But without a doubt, some exotic brands still try to sell a classic masculine fantasy. Get the (very expensive) car, and you'll get the girl. It seems sexism, for some, can still be very profitable. And it's hard to see that changing. ",

        "content": "The #MeToo movement against male harassment has empowered women in the US and elsewhere, but it is not the only women's movement to have an impact over the last year. We asked BBC journalists to choose other key triumphs that have made this a momentous year for women around the world. A rice bunny rebellion: Lara Owen, East Asia Women's Affairs Journalist\nThe #MeToo movement to expose harassment has become a worldwide phenomenon, but in a country like China - a one-party state with strict censorship - women have fewer ways to challenge the status quo. That hasn't stopped them from using a combination of two emojis - a bowl of rice and a rabbit - to get round the authorities. In early January, Luo Xixi, a female graduate of a well-known Beijing university wrote an open letter on Chinese social media platform Weibo describing her former professor had tried to pressure her into sex. The university launched an investigation which found Chen Xiaowu guilty of sexual harassment and removed him from his post. While this has happened in China before, the issue has for the most part been ignored in public discourse. This time it was different. What followed was a movement spearheaded by Chinese feminists, university students and alumni across China, but soon some universities warned students to tone down their activism. There were reports of open letters being deleted and hashtags censored. \"Rice bunny\" - which in Mandarin Chinese is pronounced \"mi tu\" - became a nickname for the movement. Rice bunnies might sound cute, but they have given Chinese women a tool to discuss their experience of sexual harassment without fear of censorship. A cabin size coup: Nina Nazarova, Russia Women's Affairs Journalist\nTwo female flight attendants sued the major Russian airline Aeroflot for alleged discrimination in September, saying they had been shifted to less lucrative routes because of their body size. While more young female activists talk about the importance of body positive attitude, a lot of people in Russia still believe that in order to be successful a woman should be young, thin and conventionally sexually attractive. Evgenia Magurina and Irina Ierusalimskaya learned this the hard way when, after six and 19 years respectively of working for Aeroflot, their salaries dropped by 30% in summer 2016. When they confronted their bosses they were told they didn't meet the size limit Aeroflot had set for its cabin crew. This was a Russian size 48 - about a UK 14 or US 12. That's why, instead of long-haul flights - to Miami for example - they had been relegated to shorter night trips around Russia, \"so no-one will see us\" they told the BBC. The two flight attendants lost their first case in court, which angered many on social media, but later won on appeal. The judge ruled that Aeroflot had to pay them their full salaries and also awarded both women compensation for emotional distress. Although the compensation was purely symbolic - 5,000 roubles (\u00a365) each - Ms Magurina and Ms Ierusalimskaya were pleased with the outcome as the court also told the airline to eliminate the article in its regulations concerning body size. Sharing vital statistics: Vanessa Buschschluter, Latin America and Caribbean editor, BBC News website\nBeauty pageants continue to draw huge audiences in Latin America. That's probably not surprising given that Latin American candidates have won more than 20 of the Miss Universe pageants since they started in 1952. Traditional ideas of female beauty are still held high in Latin American societies where machismo rules and women are meant to, above all, look pretty. That's also why plastic surgery is so popular, not just with the rich, but across society. Pageants are also seen as a chance for young women, who may lack other opportunities, to get highly paid jobs as models, in advertising or in TV - as well as to travel, if not the world, than at least the country. There has been some criticism of their prevalence in the region. In 2012 the then-governor of the Colombian province of Antioquia banned pageants from schools. \"School is for studying, not for runways,\" he said, and promoted science competitions instead. But even so beauty pageants in the region have generally remained politics-free zones, except for the often-expressed desire of contestants for \"world peace\". So it came as a total surprise when participants in Peru's Miss Universe pageant came on stage one by one in October reciting not their bust, waist and hip measurements but statistics of gender violence. \"My measurements are: 2,202 cases of reported murders of women in the last year in my country,\" one contestant said. \"My measurements are: 70% of women have been harassed in the street,\" said another. While the statements had been planned with the organisers of the event, the statistics came as a surprise to viewers, many of whom had tuned in for an evening of light entertainment. Some said that the pageant was not the right forum, but many more supported the move and expressed their solidarity on social media under the hashtag #MisMedidasSon (#MyMeasurementsAre). The poster girl of change: Sarah Buckley, 100 Women Journalist\nIn the terrible aftermath of the Valentine's Day fatal shooting in Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Florida, a young woman emerged to spit out the collective fury of her fellow students. Tearful but impassioned, 18-year-old Emma Gonzalez crystallised the indignation and grief of her community in an eloquent and rhetorical address. \"I am going to happily ask [US President Trump] how much money he received from the National Rifle Association [NRA],\" she said, adding, \"OK. You want to know something? It doesn't matter because I already know,\" she proclaimed. \"$30 million!\", she went on. \"And divided by the number of gunshot victims in the United States, in the one and one-half months in 2018 alone, that comes out to being $5,800 [per victim]. Is that how much these people are worth to you, Trump?\" As a Latina, bisexual woman Ms Gonzalez represents many of the communities who have felt victimised ever since President Trump came to power, but her speech was anything but disempowered. \"This is the movement that you're going to read about in a text book one day,\" she told the BBC. \"You're either killing the children or you are saving them.\" First name terms: Faranak Amidi, Middle East Women's Affairs Journalist\nIn Afghanistan's largely conservative society, calling and identifying a woman in public by her first name is taboo. Indeed in many parts of Afghanistan it is considered a disgrace for men if their mother, sister, wife or daughter's first name is known to men outside their family. It is not a legal ban, but rather a cultural barrier. On everything from wedding invitations to gravestones, women's names are left off - they are usually referred to simply as 'the daughter of Mr X', or simply, 'Miss'. In public women are simply referred to as 'the wife of', 'the mother of', or 'the daughter of', a man. Last year Afghan women started an online campaign called #WhereIsMyName, aimed at breaking this taboo and reclaiming women's identities. Laleh Osmani, one of the campaign organisers, was motivated to start the campaign when she came across the death notice of the wife of a famous poet on Facebook. In the notice there was no mention of the name of the deceased, or her female relatives. She realised that even among the intellectual elite, who might be expected to be more open minded, this tradition was being upheld. The women behind the campaign urged clerics and mullahs to help change the culture surrounding women's identities. A lipstick up to the patriarchy: Divya Arya, South Asia Women's Affairs Journalist\nAn unusual rebellion took centre stage in India during the hot summer, featuring hundreds of selfies using the middle finger. The Hindi-language film Lipstick Under My Burkha was finally released in India, examining the lives and desires of four women from small-town India, after a six-month legal tussle with the film censors. It had initially been refused certification for being too \"lady oriented\" with \"continuous sex scenes\", \"abusive words\" and \"audio pornography\". The Censor Board did not elaborate on these objections but it is not unusual for it to suggest cuts or ban films altogether, and film makers often have to approach higher tribunals to get their films passed. In the recent past, the board has been criticised by the film industry for being irrational and making decisions on an inconsistent basis. It has been asked to edit out scenes involving sex and violence, swear words or even a kiss. The director of Lipstick Under My Burkha, Alankrita Shrivastava, told the BBC, \"The Central Board of Film Certification is outdated and illogical. Its members have no idea about gender issues and gender politics.\" Bollywood has traditionally shied away from being very confrontational, but that is changing. For Ms Shrivastava and the makers of her film, just getting the certification (with some cuts) was not enough. They launched a new poster that used lipstick as the middle finger of a woman's hand. The female leads of the film then all posted similar photos, using the hashtag #LipstickRebellion, and the trend caught on. For more than a month, as the film was being shown, both actors and the public - both men and women - posted selfies giving the middle finger to patriarchy. No more 'marry your rapist': Alma Hassoun, Arabic Women's Affairs Journalist\nIn many communities in Arabic cultures, women who have been raped are seen as a source of shame for their families and so the crime is hidden to avoid a scandal. Women are neither socially nor legally supported to speak up and the rapists who are identified are legally exempt from punishment if they marry their victims. It is not easy to explain how powerful this patriarchal mindset is, but it lives in a context in which sex outside of marriage is not acceptable for women. Indeed in many cultures, being a virgin is a prerequisite for future wives. Last summer, Tunisia, Lebanon and Jordan scrapped the laws which saved rapists from jail if they married their victims. This is something local activists have been pushing for for years. In Lebanon, for example, in one of the campaigns more than 30 white wedding dresses were hung from nooses between the palm trees. Earlier, women dressed in wedding dresses made from bandages to protest against the law. Similarly, Jordanians launched an e-campaign to stress their demands. Egypt was the first Arabic country to scrap the law in 1999, but change is slow, and three countries in one year feels like a watershed moment. A full stop to bus stop violence: Abigail Ony Nwaohuocha, Africa Women's Affairs Journalist\nOn 19 July 2017 three men were sentenced to death for robbing, stripping, and sexually assaulting a female passenger for wearing a miniskirt at a public bus stop in Kenya's Githurai district. The case ruling was momentous for women not only in Kenya but all over Africa. This was one of two landmark cases involving the sexual assault and violent robbery of women on public transport in a country where women make up the majority of commuters. For many Kenyan women like Naomi Mwaura, a reproductive health and gender rights activist who helped organise the protest, \"this ruling is the strong message needed to criminalise violence against women and reaffirm the rights of women to live free of violence in public spaces, especially the transport industry\". Three years earlier, in November 2014, hundreds of people came together on the Nairobi streets for a historic march to protest the sexual violence of women in the capital, after a video of the attack surfaced online. The protest was later coined #MyDressMyChoice and influenced the court's decision and became a global movement. The Kenyan's court pronouncement sent a clear signal to the rest of Africa that women's rights are not to be tampered with. \"I feel honoured to have supported the cause,\" said Ms Mwaura who helped organize the protest, \"and most importantly, to see justice in my lifetime.\" What is 100 Women?\nBBC 100 Women names 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year.

        "content": "Counter-terrorism officers are working to uncover the origin of the nerve agent used in the attempted murder of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury. The pair were found unconscious and are critically ill in hospital, along with a policeman who went to their aid. A source told BBC News the chemical used on Sunday was likely to be rarer than Sarin or VX nerve agents. Home Secretary Amber Rudd is expected to make a statement in the Commons. Police said government scientists had identified the nerve agent used, but would not make that information public at this stage. The source familiar with the investigation told the BBC it was likely to be rarer than the Sarin gas thought to have been used in Syria and in an attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995. And it was said not to be VX - the nerve agent used to kill the half brother of the Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Malaysia last year. Col Skripal, 66, was convicted of passing secrets to MI6 but given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a \"spy swap\". It is known that he and his 33-year-old daughter had visited The Bishop's Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury before they were found collapsed on a bench near the Maltings shopping centre. But police have yet to say if they know how and where the poison was administered. Addressing reporters outside New Scotland Yard, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said: \"This is being treated as a major incident involving attempted murder, by administration of a nerve agent.\" \"Having established that a nerve agent is the cause of the symptoms... I can also confirm that we believe that the two people who became unwell were targeted specifically.\" He added: \"Our role now of course is to establish who is behind this and why they carried out this act.\" Nerve agents are highly toxic chemicals that stop the nervous system working and shut down bodily functions. They normally enter the body through the mouth or nose, but can also be absorbed through the eyes or skin. Mr Rowley said there was no evidence of a widespread health risk to the public. Police said they want to speak to anyone who was in the centre of Salisbury on Sunday afternoon. They are particularly keen to hear from people who ate at Zizzi or drank in pub between 13:00 and 16:00 GMT. Both sites remain closed to the public. There is also a cordon in place outside Mr Skripal's Salisbury home and part of a business park in nearby Amesbury. Hundreds of detectives, forensic officers, analysts and intelligence officers are working on the case, which has drawn comparison with the killing of the Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko with radioactive polonium-210 in London in 2006. A public inquiry concluded his death was probably carried out with the approval of President Putin. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs on Tuesday that the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the Skripal case. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, but is open to co-operating with British police if requested. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said foreign media had used the case as part of an anti-Russian campaign. Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Col Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years. Do you have any information to share on this story?

        "content": "On Thursday it will be four years since Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 disappeared. With the mystery still unsolved, some relatives of passengers have criticised plans for a memorial in Australia. The memorial is scheduled to be completed in Perth, on the west coast, by September. According to the Australian government, the site will honour the 239 people on board when the plane went missing in 2014. It is also designed to recognise Australia's role in the failed recovery mission. However, some relatives have condemned the idea of a memorial when the plane has not been found. They also fear it could become a tourist attraction - or a curse - and argue they should have been better consulted. 'Absolutely ridiculous'\nA proposal for an Australian-based tribute was first floated in 2014, but it was not authorised by the government until last year. Australian Danica Weeks, whose husband Paul was on the flight, said she was blindsided by a recent email that said the memorial's design was up for tender. \"No-one was consulted. It's absolutely ridiculous,\" she said. \"We haven't found the plane yet, so why are we having a memorial?\" For her, the memorial represents Australian authorities \"closing the chapter\" on the missing flight, even as a privately funded search continues. \"They're just doing it for their own benefit,\" she told the BBC. \"I hate to say it, but it's just obviously a tourist attraction.\" Jeanette Maguire, whose sister and brother-in-law Cathy and Bob Lawton were on the flight, said she appreciated the gesture but it was ill-advised. \"There's no point in having a memorial when we can't get past 'where are they?'\" she said. \"We want you to spend the time and effort on actually finding them.\" Both families said they had received little information on what the memorial might look like, or include. Authorities have said it will be built in a central, easily accessible island on the Swan River in Perth. The city was the base for the official search by Australia, Malaysia and China in the southern Indian Ocean. More than two-thirds of those on board were from China, which lies more than 5,000km (3,100 miles) from Perth. Jiang Hui, whose mother Jiang Cuiyun was on board, said he believed that distance would prevent Chinese families from visiting the site. But Mr Jiang said he was also most angered by a memorial pre-dating the discovery of the plane. \"In the eyes of the Chinese, a monument can only be erected after it is confirmed that person is dead,\" said Mr Jiang, who acts as a representative for several Chinese MH370 families. \"Maybe you don't understand Asian people's customs. If you haven't found the people, the monument is like putting a curse on them.\" He also accused Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of keeping Chinese families in the dark. He said Chinese relatives only found out about the memorial from media reports. Chinese families wrote an open letter to the Australian government in January, calling for the project to be cancelled, and asking to be consulted on future plans. They have not received a response. When asked by the BBC about such opposition, the Australian government said it had consulted Australian families and they would \"continue to be engaged during the design process\". The government did not respond to a question about non-Australian families. The state government of Western Australia (WA), which is funding half of the project, said it had raised relatives' concerns with Canberra. \"The WA Government understands the sensitivities, and expected consultation with families of those missing to be very thorough,\" a spokesman said. Design interest\nA public tender for the A$126,000 (\u00a370,000; $98,000) memorial, which closed on 31 January, attracted many submissions from local and international artists, the state government said. Artists were asked to design a site that helps \"reflect upon personal loss while engendering a sense of peace\". The tender noted the island site was carefully selected because \"the connection with the water is significant\". The tender also said designs should respect \"Chinese cultural sensitivities\". It advised that MH370 passengers should be referred to as \"those lost\" rather than \"those who died\", and not include a list of names. The successful design is expected to be revealed in April and be built by September. Wait continues\nBy then, the outcome of the privately funded Ocean Infinity search for the plane will also be known. Malaysia has confirmed the search, which began in January, will conclude in June. \"I hope they are successful in finding the plane, and the answers that we so desperately need four years on,\" Ms Weeks said. \"We deserve the right to have a proper goodbye.\" ",

        "content": "An Australian farmer has found six cows lying dead in a row, in what experts have attributed to a lightning strike. The animals were discovered next to a barbed-wire fence on a paddock in Queensland last week, a few days after a heavy storm. The cows' owner, Derek Shirley, said he was \"stunned\" by the find. Dr Sabrina Lomax, a livestock expert from Sydney University, said she believed all six animals had been touching the fence when they died. \"In these sort of freak accidents, it was just an inconvenient placement of the animals in regards to the [lightning] strike,\" said Dr Lomax, an animal behaviour and welfare researcher. \"They would have died instantly from a massive heart attack.\" Mr Shirley, whose farm is about 70km (40 miles) south of Brisbane, said he initially thought the cows had been poisoned. \"You just do not see them all lined up against the fence,\" Mr Shirley said. \"You could nearly run a ruler on them.\" Science commentator Dr Karl Kruszelnicki said the cows may have been shocked when the lightning hit the ground. \"The electric field goes in through their back legs, through the body\u2026 and they have a heart attack,\" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. In 2016, more than 300 reindeer were killed in a lightning storm in Norway. ",

        "content": "China has said it is \"cheering on\" North and South Korea after they agreed to hold a leaders' summit on reducing tensions on the peninsula. But foreign ministry officials have cautioned it is too early to assume the talks will bring a lasting breakthrough on the central issue - nuclear weapons. The two Koreas held a landmark meeting in Pyongyang earlier this week. The South Korean delegation is now en route to the US, and are expected to pass on a message from Kim Jong-un. South Korea has said the North has indicated it is prepared to give up its nuclear weapons programme - a defining feature of its politics for decades - if the US agrees to guarantee its security. \"We cannot reveal everything to the media but we do have additional views of North Korea we will relay to the United States when we visit the US,\" South Korea's head of national security Chung Eui-yong told reporters. He and Suh Hoon (C), head of the National Intelligence Service, will head to Japan, Russia and China to brief them on the developments. The US, which only this week increased its sanctions on Pyongyang over the death of Mr Kim's brother Kim jong-nam, has said it is open to talking to North Korea, but only if it commits to denuclearisation. The past year has seen fierce exchanges of threats between the US and North Korea. North Korea has test-fired increasingly powerful missiles and at one point seemed primed to fire a missile towards the tiny US Pacific territory of Guam. But the Winter Olympics in South Korea provided an unexpected window for diplomacy, with North Korea appearing to be pushing for a de-escalation. South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong-un have now agreed to meet at the border and discuss a halt to the weapons testing. \"We are cheering them on\", Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters on Thursday. He said China, North Korea's main economic supporter, hoped both sides would seize the change to denuclearise the peninsula while acknowledging each others' \"legitimate security concerns\". Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the summit would be \"an important step in the right direction\" and called on the US and North Korea to \"engage in dialogue sooner rather than later\". However the prime minister of Japan, which saw two North Korean missiles fly over its territory last year, voiced distrust of North Korea's motives. Shinzo Abe said Pyongyang had used past instances of diplomacy to quietly develop its nuclear capabilities and missiles. \"Talks for the sake of talks are meaningless and we should never loosen sanctions just because North Korea is open to talks,\" he said. \"North Korea has to show concrete actions toward denuclearisation by committing to abandon its nuclear programme via complete, verifiable and irreversible means.\" The last time major international talks were held to persuade North Korea to disarm were the so-called Six Party Talks involving North and South Korea, the US, China Japan, and Russia. North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear and weapons programme in exchange for aid and reduced sanctions. But the talks broke down in 2008, after failing to agree on how to verify the North's commitments, and in 2009 North Korea conducted its second nuclear weapons test. ",

        "content": "Many trains in Spain have been cancelled as workers prepare to strike to highlight gender inequalities on International Women's Day. Three-hundred trains will not be operating on Thursday, the country's transport ministry announced. A 24-hour strike, called by 10 unions, has been the subject of much debate. Feminist groups have also asked women to spend no money and to ditch their domestic chores for the day. But some have come out against the strike. The ruling centre-right party, the Partido Popular (PP), said the action was \"for feminist elites and not real women with everyday problems\". While 10 of Spain's unions have called for 24-hour strikes, two of the most powerful have asked their members to participate in a two-hour stoppage. Madrid's underground network will also be disrupted. Actress and model Penelope Cruz has cancelled planned public events and will go on \"domestic\" strike. Two of the five female ministers in Spain's conservative government, Agriculture Minister Isabel Garc\u00eda Tejerina and the president of the Madrid region Cristina Cifuentes, have said they will be observing a day of work-to-rule. A poll of 1,500 people, quoted in the daily newspaper El Pa\u00eds, suggested 82% supported the strike while 76% thought women in Spain had harder lives than men. \"There is a ceiling that a woman reaches, no matter how prepared she is, no matter how many masters she may have\", Elvira Gonz\u00e1lez, a pharmacist in the Madrid suburb of Vallecas told El Pa\u00eds. In Spain, women were paid 13% and 19% less than their male counterparts in the public and private sectors respectively, data from the European Union's statistical provider Eurostat said. In 2016, women's gross hourly earnings in the European Union were on average 16.2 % below those of men. You might also like:\n",

        "content": "The death of a homeless man who played piano on the street has struck a chord with many in the Canadian city of Edmonton, Alberta. Ryan Arcand was used to the sounds of the city - cars honking, people shouting, the steady hum of traffic - while living on the street. He died last week at the age of 46 after years of struggling with alcoholism, mental health and homelessness. But the legacy of his music will live on. A video of him playing a song he wrote on a piano in downtown Edmonton went viral on YouTube in 2014 with more than 11 million views. Arcand was a member of the Alexander First Nation in Alberta and was placed in the foster-care system along with his brother at the age of three or four, family members told CBC. It was in foster care where the musician first found a piano in a basement. \"It was as though we were meant for each other,\" Arcand explained to the CBC shortly after the YouTube video went viral. \"You're looking at the piano and you're falling in love with it.\" He learned to play themes from television and movies by ear, and later began to write his own music. At 13, he says he ran away to the city of Edmonton where he lived on the streets. Alcohol soon became the driving force in his life, but beneath the haze, his love of music persisted, he said. He played on pianos in churches, hospitals and in Sir Winston Churchill square. That was where Roslyn Polard discovered him one day, and took the video that would make him famous. The song he played for her was appropriately called \"The Beginning\". His newfound notoriety earned him the nickname \"piano man\" and helped get him into supportive housing. Polard used the money she made from the video to buy a piano for the housing complex's lobby so that he could play every day. But he would soon begin shuffling between housing, the streets, jail and hospital for the next few years. Soon he was barred from playing in Sir Winston Churchill square and many of his other regular spots after getting caught with open beer bottles. \"I've been drinking. It's terrible\u2026I don't know what to do anymore,\" he told APTN television network in 2016 after a six-month stint in jail for petty crime. \"(My music) is a broken dream. A dream that could've been\u2026There's no more hope out there for me, to be honest.\" In mourning him, friends and family say they are remembering his character. \"In his best moments, he had a faith that really humbled me, as a priest,\" Rev Kris Schmidt, an associate priest at St Joseph's Basilica where Arcand sometimes attended church, told the CBC. \"When he wasn't drinking, he was a joy to have around.\" His family will bury him on the Alexander First Nation this weekend. \"I find comfort in knowing his struggles that he went through, all that sadness ... is in the past,\" his cousin Chris Yellowbird told the CBC.

The top four women in the report by publisher Hurun - and five of the top 10 - come from the Asian superpower. Zhou Qunfei, who founded a firm that makes glass used to cover laptops and smartphones, was the world's richest self-made woman, with $9.8bn (\u00a37.1bn). Her company Lens Technology has contracts with some of the biggest technology firms, and counts Apple and Samsung as its main customers. Ms Zhou, who came from a poor rural background, also featured on the Forbes Billionaires list released earlier this week. Forbes ranked her as the world's 16th richest woman overall, with all of those above her appearing to have inherited or married into their wealth. In total, 28 of the top 50 on the Hurun self-made list are from China. Ms Zhou took the top spot from Beijing-based real estate developer Chen Lihua ($8.1bn). Ms Chen, who runs Fu Wah International, slipped to third after her wealth barely changed since 2017. Another property developer, Wu Yajun from the western city of Chongqing, moved into second place. She is worth $9.3bn after a staggering 83% leap in her fortune in just 12 months. The richest self-made woman from outside China is American Diane Hendricks, the co-founder of Wisconsin-based ABC Supply, one of the US's largest distributors of roofing and windows. Chief executive of Vietnamese airline VietJet, Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao, is the highest new entrant on the list, with Hurun putting her wealth at $2.8bn. Fortunes growing\nIndia, which has a similar sized population, has only has one woman on the list - Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw who runs pharmaceutical giant Biocon Also noticeable from the list is the huge growth in the fortunes of the billionaires in just the past year. Ms Zhou, for example, is worth 45% more than she was in 2017, with another woman on the list, Hong Kong pharmaceuticals executive Zheng Xiangling more than doubling her wealth. ",

        "content": "The poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in Salisbury once again dominates coverage in the papers, with the Daily Telegraph, Times and Daily Mirror all leading their reports on the news a police officer who went to their aid is also fighting for his life. The Independent website says it has been told by sources that Britain's security services are hunting a network of highly trained assassins, responsible for what the paper calls the \"brutal and sophisticated attack\" in Salisbury. The Financial Times says it marks one of the first times a nerve agent has been used away from the battlefield, while the Daily Mirror talks of a \"deadly toxin on the streets of Britain\". Elsewhere, the Telegraph expects Home Secretary Amber Rudd to make a Commons statement in the coming hours amid what it describes as \"growing speculation that the Russian ambassador will be expelled from London\". The Daily Mirror says Britain is preparing to expel \"dozens\" of Russian diplomats and spies. The suspicion in Downing Street, says the Guardian, will be that the Kremlin has carried out \"another brazen assassination operation on British soil\", despite its furious denials of involvement. Women mean business\nAccording to the Daily Mirror, \"rolling out the red carpet\" for the Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, was \"a shameful act\". It accuses Theresa May of \"grovelling before a despotic ruler of a brutal kingdom\" - further proof, the paper says, of this government's lack of ethics. However, the Sun says he is credited with dragging Saudi Arabia into the 21st Century and protesters outside No 10 were unaware that inside Mrs May was convincing him to drop his blockade of Yemen. According to the Times, the crown prince offers \"a compelling vision of change\" for his country. Britain should work closely with him and press for even deeper reforms, it says. The Daily Telegraph has a banner across the front page reminding readers that it is International Women's Day. It announces the launch of a campaign, backed by business leaders, MPs and academics, to help women entrepreneurs raise capital to start a business. The Guardian marks the day with a number of opinion pieces by women - including one from Theresa May, describing domestic abuse legislation being unveiled as part of her \"longstanding commitment\" to end it. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning There is a blunt response from some quarters to the warning from the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, that trade with the UK will be \"more complicated and costly\" after Brexit. According to the Sun, Mr Tusk and the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier are not putting their citizens and economies first - they care only about the sanctity of the EU and its institutions. The Daily Mail agrees, accusing them of putting obstacles in the way of a trade deal. But according to the Guardian, the UK side has systematically failed to grasp that inside or outside the single market is a binary choice. 'Decline of a giant'\nThe Daily Mail's Richard Kay claims an exclusive with a report that Meghan Markle has been baptised into the Church of England in a secret ceremony with Prince Harry at her side. The intimate 45 minute service was conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury at the Chapel Royal on Tuesday evening, he says, using water from the River Jordan. Finally, the announcement that this week's edition of the music paper, NME, will be the last to appear in print form provokes pages of nostalgic outpourings, not least from Tony Parsons in the Sun. He began his career there as a 22 year old in 1977, and describes a world steeped in drugs, drink, pop, rock and punk. \"No one cared if we breathed fumes of alcohol over the typewriters after a three-day bender,\" he writes, \"so long as we hit our deadlines\". The Guardian laments \"the decline of a music giant\". NME, according to its music critic, Alexis Petridis, had become \"an irrelevant shadow of its former self\". ",

He is the first Indian to receive the award, considered to be architecture's highest honour. Doshi studied in Mumbai before travelling to Paris in the 1950s to work for the Franco-Swiss pioneer, Le Corbusier. He will be awarded $100,000 (\u00a380,591) at a ceremony in Toronto in May. Previous winners include J\u00f8rn Utzon who designed the Sydney Opera House, Oscar Niemeyer of Brazil and the British-Iraqi designer, Zaha Hadid. \"Balkrishna Doshi has always created an architecture that is serious, never flashy or a follower of trends,\" said the Pritzker jury. The jury added that Doshi \"constantly demonstrates that all good architecture and urban planning must not only unite purpose and structure but must take into account climate, site, technique, and craft, along with a deep understanding and appreciation of the context in the broadest sense\". \"Projects must go beyond the functional to connect with the human spirit through poetic and philosophical underpinnings.\" Doshi thanked the jury and said in a statement that his works \"are an extension of my life, philosophy and dreams trying to create treasury of the architectural spirit\". \"Every object around us, and nature itself - lights, sky, water and storm - everything is in a symphony,\" Doshi was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency. \"This symphony is what architecture is all about.\" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to Twitter to congratulate him. Congratulations to renowned architect Balkrishna Doshi for winning the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. This honour is a fitting recognition of his outstanding work, which has spanned decades and made a notable contribution to society. https://t.co/vhKGegfeCv End of Twitter post by @narendramodi Doshi's wide ranging work in buildings include institutions, mixed-use complexes, housing projects, public spaces, galleries, and private residences. He designed a top management school in the southern city of Bangalore and a well-known low cost housing scheme in the central city of Indore. More than 6,500 homes in the Indore scheme now house some 80,000 low to middle income people. A system of houses, courtyards and a labyrinth of internal pathways make it one of the most notable low cost housing schemes in India. \"It seems I should take an oath and remember it for my lifetime: to provide the lowest class with the proper dwelling,\" Doshi said in 1954. He became one of the most influential architects of post-independence India, fusing international modernist principles with local traditions. Doshi began studying architecture in 1947, the year India gained Independence, at Mumbai's famous Sir JJ School of Architecture. Working under Le Corbusier, he returned to India in 1954 and worked on the Modernist guru's projects in the cities of Chandigarh and Ahmedabad. Doshi also collaborated with Louis Kahn, another of the 20th century's Modernist giants. ",

        "content": "Hello. Here's your morning briefing: Russian spy attacked with nerve agent\nFormer Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were attacked with a nerve agent, in a case now being treated as attempted murder, police say. They are attempting to trace the origin of the chemicals used. Mr and Ms Skripal remain in a critical condition, having been found unconscious on a bench outside a shopping centre in Salisbury, Wiltshire, at the weekend. A police officer who attended the scene is also in hospital in a serious condition. Home Secretary Amber Rudd is expected to address the House of Commons on developments later. Nerve agents - toxic chemicals that stop the nervous system working - are not normally available to criminal gangs or terrorist groups, writes BBC News correspondent Richard Galpin. They are usually manufactured in laboratories under government control, which means \"suspicion will now be very much focused on Russia\", he adds. Moscow denies any involvement. CCTV coverage has been released of Mr Skripal buying scratchcards five days before the attack. So, what do we know so far about events leading up to the attack on him and his daughter? And what does the case mean for UK-Russia relations? Florida shooting: Gun control law moves step closer\nSince the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, last month, surviving students have been campaigning for changes to gun laws. And now it looks like they might have had some success. Florida's House of Representatives has passed a bill raising the minimum age to buy a gun from 18 to 21 and imposing a three-day waiting period on all sales. It now goes to the state's governor. But the bill doesn't include a ban on the sale of assault-style weapons, despite that being a key demand of students and their parents.

        "content": "Counter-terrorism officers are working to uncover the origin of the nerve agent used in the attempted murder of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury. The pair were found unconscious and are critically ill in hospital, along with a policeman who went to their aid. A source told BBC News the chemical used on Sunday was likely to be rarer than Sarin or VX nerve agents. Home Secretary Amber Rudd is expected to make a statement in the Commons. Police said government scientists had identified the nerve agent used, but would not make that information public at this stage. The source familiar with the investigation told the BBC it was likely to be rarer than the Sarin gas thought to have been used in Syria and in an attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995. And it was said not to be VX - the nerve agent used to kill the half brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Malaysia last year. Col Skripal, 66, was convicted of passing secrets to MI6 but given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a \"spy swap\". It is known that he and his 33-year-old daughter had visited the Bishop's Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury before they were found collapsed on a bench near the Maltings shopping centre. A witness, who saw the pair at the restaurant, told the BBC Mr Skripal was acting \"very strange\" and was \"very agitated\". \"He seemed to lose his temper... and he just started screaming at the top of his voice, he wanted his bill and he wanted to go.\" Police have yet to say if they know how and where the poison was administered. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said: \"This is being treated as a major incident involving attempted murder, by administration of a nerve agent. \"Having established that a nerve agent is the cause of the symptoms... I can also confirm that we believe that the two people who became unwell were targeted specifically.\" He added: \"Our role now of course is to establish who is behind this and why they carried out this act.\" Nerve agents are highly toxic chemicals that stop the nervous system working and shut down bodily functions. They normally enter the body through the mouth or nose, but can also be absorbed through the eyes or skin. Mr Rowley said there was no evidence of a widespread health risk to the public. Police said they wanted to speak to anyone who was in the centre of Salisbury on Sunday afternoon. They are particularly keen to hear from people who ate at Zizzi or drank in the Bishop's Mill pub between 13:00 and 16:00 GMT. Both sites remain closed to the public. There is also a cordon in place outside Mr Skripal's Salisbury home and part of a business park in nearby Amesbury. Hundreds of detectives, forensic officers, analysts and intelligence officers are working on the case, which has drawn comparison with the killing of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko with radioactive polonium-210 in London in 2006. A public inquiry concluded his death was probably carried out with the approval of President Putin. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs on Tuesday that the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the Skripal case. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, but is open to co-operating with British police if requested. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said foreign media had used the case as part of an anti-Russian campaign. Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Col Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years. Do you have any information to share on this story?

        "content": "Some countries may be exempt from US plans to impose tariffs on metal imports, the White House has announced. The exemptions - on national security grounds - included Canada, Mexico, spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said. Reports, however, suggested the apparent softening of the US stance would last for only 30 days. US President Donald Trump has said steel products will face a 25% tariff, with 10% on aluminium goods. He is expected to sign the plan on Thursday. Meanwhile, China threatened an \"appropriate and necessary response\" in any trade war with the US. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China and the US should strive to be partners rather than rivals. The EU has proposed retaliatory measures against a number of US goods including bourbon and peanut butter. Despite opposition at home and abroad, Ms Sanders said the US president would sign the measures in by the end of the week. But she added: \"There are potential carve-outs for Mexico and Canada based on national security, and possibly other countries as well based on that process. That would be [on] a case-by-case and country by country basis.\" President Trump has previously suggested that planned tariffs for Canada and Mexico could be abandoned if a \"new and fair\" North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) is signed. White House trade policy adviser Peter Navarro said on Wednesday that the tariffs would start in 15 to 30 days' time and there would be \"a clause that does not impose these tariffs immediately on Canada and Mexico\". Both countries knew the president was not \"messing around in this\", he added. Why is Mr Trump doing this?\nMr Trump has railed against the US trade deficit, arguing that other countries have been \"taking advantage of\" the US for decades. One of his campaign promises was to rebuild the US steel and aluminium industries which he said has suffered \"disgraceful\" treatment from other countries, in particular cheap Chinese imports. From Bush 1 to present, our Country has lost more than 55,000 factories, 6,000,000 manufacturing jobs and accumulated Trade Deficits of more than 12 Trillion Dollars. Last year we had a Trade Deficit of almost 800 Billion Dollars. Bad Policies & Leadership. Must WIN again! #MAGA End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump Last week he dismissed concerns he could trigger a trade war, instead saying \"trade wars are good\" and were something the US would easily win. Mr Trump has already hinted he could drop plans to impose tariffs on Mexican and Canadian metals but linked it to the US getting a better deal in the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Mexico and Canada are among the main suppliers of steel to the US. What's the reaction been?\nThe US plans have sparked worldwide alarm and jolted stock markets. Critics argue that the tariffs would fail to protect American jobs and would ultimately raise prices for consumers. International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde warned \"nobody wins\" in a trade war, saying it would harm global economic growth. The EU has set out tit-for-tat plans to impose import duties on bourbon, peanut butter, cranberries, orange juice, steel, and industrial products. Other countries are also considering retaliatory steps. Members of Mr Trump's Republican party are concerned too, with House Speaker Paul Ryan saying he wanted to see tariffs that were \"more surgical and more targeted\". Tuesday saw the departure of top White House economic advisor Gary Cohn, who is a strong supporter of free trade. ",

        "content": "A quarter of women rescued from modern slavery in the UK are pregnant and facing \"shocking\" levels of danger and deprivation, says a charity. Hestia, which runs safe houses, says pregnant women can escape or be abandoned by traffickers and left to sleep rough without any healthcare. \"Many contemplate suicide. All are isolated and long for contact with their mothers,\" says the study. The charity says \"urgent action\" is needed to help such vulnerable women. Hestia, one of the UK's biggest providers of support for victims of slavery, says there is insufficient help for the security, health and psychological needs of trafficked and often traumatised women who are pregnant or have recently given birth. The charity, which last year worked with almost 900 adults, is to publish a report highlighting the \"harrowing\" risks facing enslaved pregnant women who have been living in \"constant fear\". The report says that a \"disproportionately high number of women who have been victims of modern slavery present into our service pregnant, often very late in their pregnancy\". These women, who could be held as sex workers or in domestic servitude, have often had no access to healthcare. The report says some of the pregnancies were the result of rape, and women's health can be seriously damaged by being \"forced to consume alcohol or take drugs whilst they were being exploited\". Becoming pregnant could have been the trigger to end their servitude - either because they wanted to protect their child or because they have lost their value to their captors. A spokeswoman for the charity said that families keeping women in domestic servitude might not want to support a mother and baby. In one case, a woman was driven to a park and abandoned there, until she was helped by local people who found her. Women have often been trafficked through different countries and can be completely disorientated about their location, says the charity. \"Issy's\" story\n\"When Issy became pregnant, she tried to conceal it from her captors. \"When they found out, she was forcibly taken to an abortion clinic. Issy was desperate to let one of the health professionals know she did not want to go through with the abortion, but she did not speak their language and was terrified of the consequences if she was seen attracting attention. \"However, the clinic refused to perform the abortion without a medical certificate as Issy was in the second trimester of her pregnancy (13th to 27th week of pregnancy). \"Issy was returned to the flat where she was being kept and was ordered to continue having sex with her clients until they no longer wanted her. \"She overheard her captors say that they would wait until Issy's baby was born and then they would take it from her so she could continue working. \"Issy knew she had to escape. She chose a moment when her captors were distracted and ran out of the house. An older woman saw Issy visibly distressed and took her to a police station.\" Issy is a real person, but her name has been changed. Women who have been tricked by promises of work, or brought illegally into the UK, might have no documents or have anyone they can ask for help. Among such pregnant women who had left slavery, 16% became rough sleepers, others relied for food and clothes on foodbanks and charities. The report says the way that women had been mistreated raises \"questions about the human capacity for evil\". But it also says that the women's stories show \"great kindness on the part of strangers\". There were \"everyday citizens\" who had to helped to rescue women, by calling the police or intervening when they were in hospital or even \"providing a distraction for traffickers\". Who are modern slaves?\nA spokeswoman for the charity says there needs to be greater recognition of the needs of pregnant women - such as appropriate accommodation and access to health care and support for mental health problems. But there is also another emotional gap in the \"lack of family\" when women are feeling most isolated and anxious. \"It's heartbreaking. You need your mum more than ever at that point,\" she says.

        "content": "New gun control measures for Florida have passed another legal hurdle, weeks after one of the worst school shootings in US history. The state's House of Representatives passed a bill raising the age to buy a gun from 18 to 21 and imposing a three-day waiting period on all gun sales. The bill, already passed by the Senate, now goes to the state governor. Seventeen people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on 14 February. Expelled former student Nikolas Cruz, 19, has been charged with 17 counts of murder. He is suspected of using a legally bought AR-15 semi-automatic rifle to carry out the 10-minute attack, gunning down teachers and students. What is in the new law?\nIn addition to raising the age and bringing in the three-day waiting period, the legislation: The legislation does not include a ban on the sale of assault-style weapons like the AR-15, despite it being a key demand of Parkland students and their parents. Florida law already mandates a three-day waiting period for the purchase of a handgun but a person as young as 18 can buy a rifle with no waiting period. The Republican-controlled House debated the bill for about eight hours on Wednesday before voting 67-50 in favour. Has the move been welcomed?\nRyan Petty, whose daughter was among those killed, hailed the House's vote in a tweet. He said: \"We know that when it comes to preventing future acts of school violence, today's vote is just the beginning of our journey.\" State Democratic Party legislators who backed the bill said it was necessary despite the \"poison pill\" of allowing more guns in schools under the guardian programme. Florida now joins at least six other states in allowing school employees to carry firearms. Following the Parkland shooting, many surviving students had lobbied politicians for greater gun control. Gun control activists will hope the Florida measures will be a turning point in their battle with the powerful National Rifle Association and others who defend firearms ownership under the Second Amendment of the US constitution. On the day the vote passed, a 17-year-old woman student was killed in a suspected accidental shooting at a high school in Alabama. What happens now?\nGovernor Rick Scott will need to sign the bill, known as the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act, into law. It will automatically become law within 15 days unless he vetoes it. Mr Scott has not yet said he will back it, telling reporters he would \"review the bill line by line\" and consult victims' families. He has previously said he opposes US President Donald Trump's call to arm teachers. He had also previously opposed increasing the purchase age from 18 to 21. ",

        "content": "Counter-terrorism officers are working to uncover the origin of the nerve agent used in the attempted murder of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury. The pair were found unconscious and are critically ill in hospital, along with a police officer who went to their aid. A source told BBC News the chemical used on Sunday was likely to be rarer than Sarin or VX nerve agents. Home Secretary Amber Rudd is expected to make a statement in the Commons. Speaking on ITV's Good Morning Britain, Ms Rudd said the police officer remained in a very serious condition but was \"talking and engaging\" so she was \"optimistic\" for him. Police said government scientists had identified the nerve agent used, but would not make that information public at this stage. The source familiar with the investigation told the BBC it was likely to be rarer than the Sarin gas thought to have been used in Syria and in an attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995. And it was said not to be VX - the nerve agent used to kill the half brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Malaysia last year. Col Skripal, 66, was convicted of passing secrets to MI6 but given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a \"spy swap\". It is known that he and his 33-year-old daughter had visited the Bishop's Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury before they were found collapsed on a bench near the Maltings shopping centre. A witness, who saw the pair at the restaurant, told the BBC Mr Skripal was acting \"very strange\" and was \"very agitated\". \"He seemed to lose his temper... and he just started screaming at the top of his voice, he wanted his bill and he wanted to go.\" Police have yet to say if they know how and where the poison was administered. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said: \"This is being treated as a major incident involving attempted murder, by administration of a nerve agent. \"Having established that a nerve agent is the cause of the symptoms... I can also confirm that we believe that the two people who became unwell were targeted specifically.\" He added: \"Our role now of course is to establish who is behind this and why they carried out this act.\" Nerve agents are highly toxic chemicals that stop the nervous system working and shut down bodily functions. They normally enter the body through the mouth or nose, but can also be absorbed through the eyes or skin. Mr Rowley said there was no evidence of a widespread health risk to the public. Police said they wanted to speak to anyone who was in the centre of Salisbury on Sunday afternoon. They are particularly keen to hear from people who ate at Zizzi or drank in the Bishop's Mill pub between 13:00 and 16:00 GMT. Both sites remain closed to the public. There is also a cordon in place outside Mr Skripal's Salisbury home and part of a business park in nearby Amesbury. Hundreds of detectives, forensic officers, analysts and intelligence officers are working on the case, which has drawn comparison with the killing of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko with radioactive polonium-210 in London in 2006. A public inquiry concluded his death was probably carried out with the approval of President Putin. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs on Tuesday that the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the Skripal case. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, but is open to co-operating with British police if requested. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said foreign media had used the case as part of an anti-Russian campaign. Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Col Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years. Do you have any information to share on this story?

An appeal by the parents of the 12-month-old to continue his life-support treatment was dismissed by European judges on Tuesday. Isaiah suffered \"catastrophic\" brain damage due to being deprived of oxygen at birth. His parents fought a lengthy legal battle with King's College Hospital to allow further care for their son. Isaiah's father said he was \"so proud\" of his \"brave\" son as his life-support was withdrawn on Wednesday. Takesha Thomas and Lanre Haastrup had asked the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to intervene after losing two court battles in the UK., but the case was again dismissed by judges. An ECHR spokesman said the application had been declared \"inadmissible\". Doctors said Isaiah was in a low level of consciousness, could not move or breathe independently and was connected to a ventilator. King's College Hospital in London said providing further intensive care treatment was not in his best interests. ",

        "content": "Friends sitting round a Christmas tree, two long-distance lovers talking on the phone, a man fixing the internet connection for his partner. At first glance, some of Dima Nachawi's illustrations could show couples from almost anywhere in the world - but the rest of the collection tells a very different story; of air strikes, injuries and death. These pictures illustrate how real people live - and love - in Eastern Ghouta, an area of Syria where conditions have been described as \"hell on earth\" by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. \"They [the residents] still live their daily lives, they still fall in love and try to protect their beloved ones,\" says Dima. Dima grew up in Syria, but left the country a number of years ago and now lives in Beirut, where she has a career as an artist. She has worked on a variety of creative projects, looking at the situation in Syria. This \"Love is...\" collection, published on social media, shows real people and and the effect the conflict has had on their relationships. Each illustration depicts a different, anonymous couple and Dima only reveals a few details about the people she draws. \"This project was very difficult, especially the one in which the woman died,\" she says, describing the image below. \"I was imagining how the illustration was going to look but at the same time it weighed very heavy on my heart. \"It's very difficult to illustrate something that has an unhappy ending.\" \"But I was also grateful that I had this chance to reflect on the other lives of the Syrians, where they survive, they love, they are not victims, they are people that can take action and they have agency. \"This is what I want to reflect through my illustrations.\" Residents are reported to be fleeing the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta enclave as the situation there was described as \"beyond critical\". Some aid has been able to reach the rebel-held area but charities say much more is needed. More than 700 people have been killed in recent weeks, many of them children. Dima is critical of the way the international media portrays the people of Syria. \"On the human level, we are stereotyped as refugees and victims,\" she says. \"I prefer to talk to people [in Syria] to see how they're doing in their daily life and how they are trying to live and survive.\" Dima says she finds it \"very difficult\" to watch the conflict from afar. \"Every time I feel bad, I try to do something. I know that I have followers all around the world and I'm conveying a message, telling those people something that they don't know about Syria. \"I try through illustration and art to do something about it and maybe I can't massively change the current situation but I know that my illustrations are preserving something for the cultural memory, for the next generation to see and know what happened.\" What is 100 Women?\nBBC 100 Women names 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year and shares their stories.

        "content": "Snowboarder Owen Pick will be Great Britain's flag bearer at the Winter Paralympics opening ceremony in South Korea on Friday. Games debutant Pick, 26, lost his leg aged 18 while serving with the British Army in Afghanistan. He will lead out the British team at the 35,000-capacity Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium. \"To represent my country under the same flag as I fought under is huge for me,\" he said. Up to 670 athletes from 68 nations, including Russians competing under a neutral flag, will walk out into the stadium at the opening ceremony, which begins at 11:00 GMT. Two North Korean competitors, who will race in cross-country skiing, are expected to walk under a united flag with South Korea's athletes, as happened at the Winter Olympics. Britain's 17-strong team will be their biggest at a Winter Paralympics since Turin 2006, when 20 athletes took part, including a para-ice hockey team. GB will be represented in five sports - alpine skiing, snowboard, wheelchair curling and the two Nordic skiing disciplines of biathlon and cross country. Scott Meenagh will be the first British athlete to compete in Nordic skiing at a Paralympics in 20 years. Four years ago in Sochi, GB took home six medals, their highest tally for 30 years. There was gold for Kelly Gallagher and guide Charlotte Evans in the super-G, a wheelchair curling bronze, plus fourskiing medals in the visually-impaired category for Jade Etherington, who retired after the Games, and her guide Caroline Powell. The target for GB at Pyeongchang is to win between six and 12 medals, with an ambition of at least seven. If achieved, it would be their second-highest medal haul after the 10 at Innsbruck, Austria, in 1984 and their best since National Lottery funding began in 1997. \"It is quite a lot, and it's also a really tough target,\" said ParalympicsGB's chef de mission Penny Briscoe. \"Not that we should be daunted by that, because obviously investment is linked to performance. \"And the increased investment post-Sochi means that we're hoping that that will have had a positive impact on the preparation of the athletes.\" Gallagher, with guide Gary Smith, will compete in four out of the five alpine skiing disciplines, and will defend her super-G title, but is coming in off an injury-hit 2017. She will be joined in the visually-impaired classification by teenagers Menna Fitzpatrick (guided by Jennifer Kehoe) and Millie Knight (guided by Brett Wild). The pair, both 19, will begin the British interest on Saturday when they compete in the downhill at 00:30 GMT and will carry GB's greatest medal prospect, along with Gallagher, on the alpine slopes. Fitzpatrick was the first Briton to become overall IPC World Cup champion in 2016 and Knight took gold among four individual medals at the 2017 World Championships. GB will have snowboard interest at a Paralympics for the first time, after the sport's introduction four years ago, with James Barnes-Miller and Ben Moore in the upper limb impairment classification and Pick in the lower limb classification. All three will race in snowboard cross on Monday and banked slalom on Friday, and will offer outside chances of medals after all registered top-10 finishes at the most recent World Championships. Four out of the five members of the 2014 bronze medal-winning wheelchair curling team, skipped by Aileen Neilson, will return in the hope of a repeated medal success. The line-up of Neilson, Gregor Ewan, Hugh Nibloe, Bob McPherson and Angie Malone won bronze at the 2017 World Championships at the same venue where they will start their Paralympic Games campaign against world champions Norway on Saturday. Repeating what happened at the Winter Olympics last month, Russian athletes who are deemed to be clean by the International Paralympic Committee will be able to compete under a team known as Neutral Paralympic Athletes (NPA). The Russian Paralympic Committee remains suspended after a report found evidence of state-sponsored doping. Around 30 Russian athletes, all of whom must have had at least two anti-doping tests in the past six months, are expected to compete across alpine skiing, biathlon, cross country, snowboard and wheelchair curling. That is compared with 68 athletes at Sochi, where Russia topped the medal table with a record total of 80. Briscoe said the British Paralympic Association feels \"comfortable\" with the inclusion of Russian athletes at the Games. \"The IPC took a strong position regarding Russia in 2016,\" she said. \"Some progress has been made but not as much as heeds to be.\" \"Strategically, the IPC has made a very good decision by allowing athletes who can demonstrate they are clean to compete in the Games. We hope eventually that NPC Russia can compete as part of the Paralympic family.\" Temperatures in Pyeongchang are not as low as they were for the Olympics last month, sitting at about 0C. That could even reach 10C by the closing ceremony on Sunday 18 March - although it could drop to -7C for the opening ceremony. However, snowfall since the end of the Olympics and further snowfall on Thursday could cause problems. Alpine training at the Jeongseon Alpine Centre was cancelled on Wednesday because of low visibility and again succumbed to the weather on Thursday because of snowfall. IPC president Andrew Parsons told BBC Sport on Thursday: \"We have a lot of snow today so we will have to see how that affects the opening ceremony, which is outdoors. \"We have been working closely with the organising committee but when it comes to the skiing we have to see how it goes - and see about the quality and how much snow we have. But we have experienced officials on the ground to make the right decisions. \"We are not worried about fitting everything in - there are plans in place.\" ",

        "content": "Brexit should not overshadow plans to boost growth, a business lobby group conference will be told on Thursday. The biggest challenges facing businesses in the UK are to do with \"fundamentals\" rather than Brexit, the British Chambers of Commerce says. The UK government said it was committed to its industrial strategy and boosting productivity. Policy makers have wrestled with low UK productivity growth since the financial crisis. 'Training system'\n\"Government can do more than one thing at once,\" Adam Marshall, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) told BBC 5 live's Wake Up To Money. \"The best possible Brexit deal will not matter to the UK's competitiveness if the roads remain potholed and congested, if you can't get mobile phone coverage around the UK, if business broadband is poor and companies can't get the people they need because the training system isn't working to deliver for them.\" In a speech to a BCC conference in London, Mr Marshall will say: \"Successive governments have acknowledged that more could be done to get the basics right for business. \"Indeed, the current government's developing industrial strategy is upfront about many of these challenges. \"Yet the leadership and the infrastructure simply aren't there to make change happen.\" The BCC will call on the government to fund repairs on local roads, improve the capacity of railways and airports, build more houses, get rid of of mobile phone \"not-spots\", make the apprenticeship system stable and come up with a clear and easy-to-use immigration system. 'Fit for the future'\nMr Marshall will also say that \"business communities are worried about\" policies being put forward by the Labour leadership, particularly nationalisation. His comments echo earlier calls by the BCC for clarity of leadership. A Department for Business, Energy and Industry Strategy spokesperson said: \"The government's commitment to boosting the productivity and earning power of people and places across the UK remains steadfast. \"Through our industrial strategy, we are building a Britain fit for the future, with a plan to help businesses create better, higher-paying jobs in every part of the UK.\" It said its \u00a31.7bn Transforming Cities Fund will \"address weaknesses in city transport systems while improving connectivity, reducing congestion and introducing new mobility services and technology\". The spokesperson added that the government had committed to raising research and development investment to 2.4% of GDP by 2027 \"ensuring our world-class research and innovation base continues to thrive\". The UK government is in continuing discussions with the European Union about Brexit. On Wednesday, the EU rejected a UK argument that financial services should be included in a free-trade agreement.

        "content": "US President Donald Trump obtained a restraining order against an adult film actress to prevent her from speaking publicly about their alleged affair, legal documents show. Mr Trump's personal lawyer obtained the order against Stormy Daniels in private arbitration proceedings last month. It bars her from sharing \"confidential information\" about their alleged relationship, US media report. Mr Trump says allegations against him are all false. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed to reporters on Wednesday that the president had won arbitration proceedings against the actress, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. \"This case has already been won in arbitration and anything beyond that, I would refer you to the president's outside counsel,\" she said. Mr Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, emailed the restraining order to Ms Clifford's lawyer on 28 February, according to NBC News. \"The document itself is to remain confidential and not to be disclosed to anyone as per the terms of the judge's order,\" the email said. Details of the restraining order have emerged a day after Ms Clifford filed a lawsuit against Mr Trump, alleging that a non-disclosure contract she signed was invalid. She said the agreement, drawn up before the 2016 election, was \"void\" because he had not signed it. The civil lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles on Tuesday, says that only days before the election, Ms Clifford and Mr Cohen signed a \"hush agreement\" but Mr Trump did not, \"thus rendering it legally null and void and of no consequence\". The restraining order, issued on 27 February, bars Ms Clifford from sharing any information related to this non-disclosure agreement. Mr Cohen confirmed last month that he had privately paid Ms Clifford $130,000 (\u00a395,000) but did not say what it was for. He said neither Mr Trump nor the Trump Organization was a party to this transaction. ",

        "content": "Snowboarder Owen Pick will be Great Britain's flagbearer at the Winter Paralympics opening ceremony in South Korea on Friday. Games debutant Pick, 26, lost his leg aged 18 while serving with the British Army in Afghanistan. He will lead out the British team at the 35,000-capacity Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium. \"To represent my country under the same flag as I fought under is huge for me,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I got a message from the British Paralympic Association on Wednesday saying they needed to speak to me after my team meeting. \"I thought I was in trouble, but I found out I was going to be flag bearer, which was amazing. \"I had no idea. I was really really surprised and happy when I found out. It's wicked.\" Up to 670 athletes from 68 nations, including Russians competing under a neutral flag, will walk out into the stadium at the opening ceremony, which begins at 11:00 GMT. Two North Korean competitors, who will race in cross-country skiing, are expected to walk under a united flag with South Korea's athletes, as happened at the Winter Olympics. Britain's 17-strong team will be their biggest at a Winter Paralympics since Turin 2006, when 20 athletes took part, including a para-ice hockey team. GB will be represented in five sports - alpine skiing, snowboard, wheelchair curling and the two Nordic skiing disciplines of biathlon and cross country. Scott Meenagh will be the first British athlete to compete in Nordic skiing at a Paralympics in 20 years. Four years ago in Sochi, GB took home six medals, their highest tally for 30 years. There was gold for Kelly Gallagher and guide Charlotte Evans in the super-G, a wheelchair curling bronze, plus fourskiing medals in the visually-impaired category for Jade Etherington, who retired after the Games, and her guide Caroline Powell. The target for GB at Pyeongchang is to win between six and 12 medals, with an ambition of at least seven. If achieved, it would be their second-highest medal haul after the 10 at Innsbruck, Austria, in 1984 and their best since National Lottery funding began in 1997. \"It is quite a lot, and it's also a really tough target,\" said ParalympicsGB's chef de mission Penny Briscoe. \"Not that we should be daunted by that, because obviously investment is linked to performance. \"And the increased investment post-Sochi means that we're hoping that that will have had a positive impact on the preparation of the athletes.\" Gallagher, with guide Gary Smith, will compete in four out of the five alpine skiing disciplines, and will defend her super-G title, but is coming in off an injury-hit 2017. She will be joined in the visually-impaired classification by teenagers Menna Fitzpatrick (guided by Jennifer Kehoe) and Millie Knight (guided by Brett Wild). The pair, both 19, will begin the British interest on Saturday when they compete in the downhill at 00:30 GMT and will carry GB's greatest medal prospect, along with Gallagher, on the alpine slopes. Fitzpatrick was the first Briton to become overall IPC World Cup champion in 2016 and Knight took gold among four individual medals at the 2017 World Championships. GB will have snowboard interest at a Paralympics for the first time, after the sport's introduction four years ago, with James Barnes-Miller and Ben Moore in the upper limb impairment classification and Pick in the lower limb classification. All three will race in snowboard cross on Monday and banked slalom on Friday, and will offer outside chances of medals after all registered top-10 finishes at the most recent World Championships. Four out of the five members of the 2014 bronze medal-winning wheelchair curling team, skipped by Aileen Neilson, will return in the hope of a repeated medal success. The line-up of Neilson, Gregor Ewan, Hugh Nibloe, Bob McPherson and Angie Malone won bronze at the 2017 World Championships at the same venue where they will start their Paralympic Games campaign against world champions Norway on Saturday.

        "content": "A Texas appeals court has overturned a man's conviction after finding a judge had inappropriately electrified him in court, US media report. Terry Lee Morris was convicted of soliciting sexual performance from a child and was sentenced to 60 years. Judge George Gallagher ordered the bailiff to activate a stun belt sending 50,000 volts through Morris when he allegedly refused to answer questions. The higher court found that stun belts cannot be used as punishment in court. Mr Morris appealed his 2014 conviction alleging that his constitutional rights were violated when the judge used the belt as punishment for not answering questions properly. The belts - used by courtrooms such as the one Tarrant County in Texas - are affixed around the legs or midsection of a suspect in court and are used to deliver a shock to the person should they become violent. Mr Morris said he was too scared to return to court out of more electrical shocks, the Texas Eighth Court of Appeals in El Paso heard. The appeals court ruled on 28 February that Mr Morris' shocks and removal from the court was a violation of his constitutional right to be present and confront witnesses during his trial. The decision was first reported by the Texas Lawyer news website on Tuesday. He has now been ordered to stand for a new trial. During the case in which Mr Morris was convicted of soliciting sexual acts from a 15-year-old girl, Judge Gallagher asked him to enter his plea of \"guilty or not guilty\". When Mr Morris responded by saying he had a lawsuit against Judge Gallagher and his defence lawyer, the judge warned him that he would shock him if he did not \"follow the rules\", the Washington Post newspaper reported, citing court transcripts. Mr Morris asked the judge to recuse himself because of the lawsuit when the judge directed the bailiff to shock him. The judge ordered the defendant to be shocked two more times as Mr Morris told the court he had a history of mental illness and complained that he was being \"tortured\". Mr Morris's attorney, Bill Ray, told the Texas Lawyer that he did not object to the use of the stun belt because his client was acting \"like a loaded cannon ready to go off\", and that he did not really believe that he was being shocked. The appeals court said the order clarifies that all Texas judges are not allowed to shock defendants for refusing to follow the court's rules of decorum. \"Never before have we seen any behaviour like this, nor do we hope to ever see such behaviour again,\" wrote appeals court Justice Yvonne Rodriguez. \"We must speak out against it, lest we allow practices like these to affront the very dignity of the proceedings we seek to protect and lead our courts to drift from justice into barbarism.\" More on stun weapons\n",

        "content": "Counter-terrorism officers are working to uncover the origin of the nerve agent used in the attempted murder of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury. They are in a serious condition alongside a police officer who helped, but he has been \"talking and engaging\". BBC News understands the chemical used on Sunday was likely to be rare. The home secretary said there was \"nothing soft\" about the UK's response to state activity. Amber Rudd told Radio 4's Today: \"Let me be clear, we are absolutely robust about any crimes committed on these streets of the UK.\" Police said government scientists had identified the nerve agent used, but would not make that information public at this stage. The source familiar with the investigation told the BBC it was likely to be rarer than the Sarin gas thought to have been used in Syria and in an attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995. And it was said not to be VX - the nerve agent used to kill the half brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Malaysia last year. Col Skripal, 66, was convicted of passing secrets to MI6 but given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a \"spy swap\". It is known that he and his 33-year-old daughter had visited the Bishop's Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury before they were found collapsed on a bench near the Maltings shopping centre. A witness, who saw the pair at the restaurant, told the BBC Mr Skripal was acting \"very strange\" and was \"very agitated\". \"He seemed to lose his temper... and he just started screaming at the top of his voice, he wanted his bill and he wanted to go.\" Police have yet to say if they know how and where the poison was administered. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said: \"This is being treated as a major incident involving attempted murder, by administration of a nerve agent. \"Having established that a nerve agent is the cause of the symptoms... I can also confirm that we believe that the two people who became unwell were targeted specifically.\" He added: \"Our role now of course is to establish who is behind this and why they carried out this act.\" Nerve agents are highly toxic chemicals that stop the nervous system working and shut down bodily functions. They normally enter the body through the mouth or nose, but can also be absorbed through the eyes or skin. Mr Rowley said there was no evidence of a widespread health risk to the public. Police said they wanted to speak to anyone who was in the centre of Salisbury on Sunday afternoon. They are particularly keen to hear from people who ate at Zizzi or drank in the Bishop's Mill pub between 13:00 and 16:00 GMT. Both sites remain closed to the public. There is also a cordon in place outside Mr Skripal's Salisbury home and part of a business park in nearby Amesbury. Hundreds of detectives, forensic officers, analysts and intelligence officers are working on the case, which has drawn comparison with the killing of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko with radioactive polonium-210 in London in 2006. A public inquiry concluded his death was probably carried out with the approval of President Putin. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs on Tuesday that the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the Skripal case. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, but is open to co-operating with British police if requested. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said foreign media had used the case as part of an anti-Russian campaign. Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal is a retired Russian military intelligence officer who was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Col Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years. Do you have any information to share on this story?

        "content": "Shares in Countrywide, Britain's largest estate agent group, have sunk more than 20% after it warned of tough times in the housing market. Countrywide, whose brands include Bairstow Eves and Gascoigne Pees, posted a sharp fall in profits and said about 150 head office jobs would go. It reported a \u00a3208.1m after-tax loss in 2017, versus a \u00a317.5m profit in 2016. Executive chairman Peter Long admitted that the patience of investors had been \"sorely tested\". The profit figures were dragged lower by one-off costs as Countrywide continued to restructure the business. But even with these are stripped out, pre-tax profits more than halved to \u00a325.2m, from \u00a352.7m in 2016. Countrywide, which called 2017 \"a disappointing year\", said trading had remained under pressure since the start of 2018 with a pipeline of work \"significantly\" below a year earlier. Falling sales\nIts previous chief executive, Alison Platt, left last month after a profit warning and announcement of a further restructuring of the business which included investment in digital operations to compete with online estate agents such as Purplebricks. Countrywide said on Thursday that it was axing about 150 of its 450-strong head office team as part of a cost-cutting drive. The firm employs about 8,000 nationwide. The results announcement laid bare the problems in its core sales and lettings arm, where earnings sank 47% to \u00a314.9m. Across sales and lettings in London, earnings fell 44% to \u00a311.5m. Mr Long said the group was working to resolve poor performance in sales and lettings, but admitted it would \"take time\". \"We believe these business units are fixable, know what we have to do to restore them and the steps to take that should result in a return to profitable growth. \"This will take time, but ultimately there will be much upside for our group and our shareholders, whose patience has been sorely tested recently.\" ",

An appeal by the parents of the 12-month-old to continue his life-support treatment was dismissed by European judges on Tuesday. Isaiah suffered \"catastrophic\" brain damage due to being deprived of oxygen at birth. His parents fought a lengthy legal battle with King's College Hospital to allow further care for their son. Isaiah's father said he was \"so proud\" of his \"brave\" son as he died at 19:50 GMT on Wednesday - hours after his life-support was withdrawn. Takesha Thomas and Lanre Haastrup had asked the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to intervene after losing two court battles in the UK, but the case was again dismissed by judges. An ECHR spokesman said the application had been declared \"inadmissible\". Doctors said Isaiah was in a low level of consciousness, could not move or breathe independently and was connected to a ventilator. King's College Hospital in London said providing further intensive care treatment was not in his best interests. A spokesman for the hospital said: \"The trust always provided Isaiah with the very best care, and the decision to apply to the courts to withdraw treatment was only made after careful consideration and after consultation with the family. \"We recognise that this has been an extremely difficult time for Isaiah's family as well as those involved in his care since birth.\" ",

Their disabilities mean that they are often most at risk from physical and sexual abuse, and many are unable to leave their homes unaccompanied. By becoming able to defend themselves, more than 60 women have been able to return to school, find jobs and become active members of society. Several have gone on to compete in national championships, winning medals and mentoring other visually impaired women in their area. Sudama started learning judo in 2014, and since then her confidence has grown considerably. She has been able to return to school. Before, she was unable to attend because her parents had to work and no other relatives were regularly available to take her. \"Before learning judo I was thinking: 'How will I go out? How will my life go on?' I used to be afraid to go to school alone. My mother and father wouldn't allow me, because it was far away.\" After returning to school, Sudama began teaching judo to her friends and later qualified as a trainer. She has gone on to win gold and silver medals in Delhi, Goa, Gurugram and Lucknow. After competing at the National Blind Judo championships in New Delhi, the young women have gained a huge level of respect within their communities. However, they still face challenges. After two years of training, 20-year-old Janki went on to win a gold medal at the National Blind and Deaf Judo Championships. She has recently been selected to compete again at the International Blind Championships, which are taking place in Turkey. But it will be very hard for her family to raise sufficient funds for her to go. Janki remains positive. \"I feel very happy that I represented my country,\" she says. \"I never thought my life would be so changed after playing judo and learning self-defence.\" The classes are organised with the help of Sightsavers charity.

        "content": "The #MeToo movement against male harassment has empowered women in the US and elsewhere, but it is not the only women's movement to have an impact over the last year. We asked BBC journalists to choose other key triumphs that have made this a momentous year for women around the world. A rice bunny rebellion: Lara Owen, East Asia Women's Affairs Journalist\nThe #MeToo movement to expose harassment has become a worldwide phenomenon, but in a country like China - a one-party state with strict censorship - women have fewer ways to challenge the status quo. That hasn't stopped them from using a combination of two emojis - a bowl of rice and a rabbit - to get round the authorities. In early January, Luo Xixi, a female graduate of a well-known Beijing university wrote an open letter on Chinese social media platform Weibo describing her former professor had tried to pressure her into sex. The university launched an investigation which found Chen Xiaowu guilty of sexual harassment and removed him from his post. While this has happened in China before, the issue has for the most part been ignored in public discourse. This time it was different. What followed was a movement spearheaded by Chinese feminists, university students and alumni across China, but soon some universities warned students to tone down their activism. There were reports of open letters being deleted and hashtags censored. \"Rice bunny\" - which in Mandarin Chinese is pronounced \"mi tu\" - became a nickname for the movement. Rice bunnies might sound cute, but they have given Chinese women a tool to discuss their experience of sexual harassment without fear of censorship. A cabin size coup: Nina Nazarova, Russia Women's Affairs Journalist\nTwo female flight attendants sued the major Russian airline Aeroflot for alleged discrimination in September, saying they had been shifted to less lucrative routes because of their body size. While more young female activists talk about the importance of body positive attitude, a lot of people in Russia still believe that in order to be successful a woman should be young, thin and conventionally sexually attractive. Evgenia Magurina and Irina Ierusalimskaya learned this the hard way when, after six and 19 years respectively of working for Aeroflot, their salaries dropped by 30% in summer 2016. When they confronted their bosses they were told they didn't meet the size limit Aeroflot had set for its cabin crew. This was a Russian size 48 - about a UK 14 or US 12. That's why, instead of long-haul flights - to Miami for example - they had been relegated to shorter night trips around Russia, \"so no-one will see us\" they told the BBC. The two flight attendants lost their first case in court, which angered many on social media, but later won on appeal. The judge ruled that Aeroflot had to pay them their full salaries and also awarded both women compensation for emotional distress. Although the compensation was purely symbolic - 5,000 roubles (\u00a365) each - Ms Magurina and Ms Ierusalimskaya were pleased with the outcome as the court also told the airline to eliminate the article in its regulations concerning body size. Sharing vital statistics: Vanessa Buschschluter, Latin America and Caribbean editor, BBC News website\nBeauty pageants continue to draw huge audiences in Latin America. That's probably not surprising given that Latin American candidates have won more than 20 of the Miss Universe pageants since they started in 1952. Traditional ideas of female beauty are still held high in Latin American societies where machismo rules and women are meant to, above all, look pretty. That's also why plastic surgery is so popular, not just with the rich, but across society. Pageants are also seen as a chance for young women, who may lack other opportunities, to get highly paid jobs as models, in advertising or in TV - as well as to travel, if not the world, than at least the country. There has been some criticism of their prevalence in the region. In 2012 the then-governor of the Colombian province of Antioquia banned pageants from schools. \"School is for studying, not for runways,\" he said, and promoted science competitions instead. But even so beauty pageants in the region have generally remained politics-free zones, except for the often-expressed desire of contestants for \"world peace\". So it came as a total surprise when participants in Peru's Miss Universe pageant came on stage one by one in October reciting not their bust, waist and hip measurements but statistics of gender violence. \"My measurements are: 2,202 cases of reported murders of women in the last year in my country,\" one contestant said. \"My measurements are: 70% of women have been harassed in the street,\" said another. While the statements had been planned with the organisers of the event, the statistics came as a surprise to viewers, many of whom had tuned in for an evening of light entertainment. Some said that the pageant was not the right forum, but many more supported the move and expressed their solidarity on social media under the hashtag #MisMedidasSon (#MyMeasurementsAre). The poster girl of change: Sarah Buckley, 100 Women Journalist\nIn the terrible aftermath of the Valentine's Day fatal shooting in Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Florida, a young woman emerged to spit out the collective fury of her fellow students. Tearful but impassioned, 18-year-old Emma Gonzalez crystallised the indignation and grief of her community in an eloquent and rhetorical address. \"I am going to happily ask [US President Trump] how much money he received from the National Rifle Association [NRA],\" she said, adding, \"OK. You want to know something? It doesn't matter because I already know,\" she proclaimed. \"$30 million!\", she went on. \"And divided by the number of gunshot victims in the United States, in the one and one-half months in 2018 alone, that comes out to being $5,800 [per victim]. Is that how much these people are worth to you, Trump?\" As a Latina, bisexual woman Ms Gonzalez represents many of the communities who have felt victimised ever since President Trump came to power, but her speech was anything but disempowered. \"This is the movement that you're going to read about in a text book one day,\" she told the BBC. \"You're either killing the children or you are saving them.\" First name terms: Faranak Amidi, Middle East Women's Affairs Journalist\nIn Afghanistan's largely conservative society, calling and identifying a woman in public by her first name is taboo. Indeed in many parts of Afghanistan it is considered a disgrace for men if their mother, sister, wife or daughter's first name is known to men outside their family. It is not a legal ban, but rather a cultural barrier. On everything from wedding invitations to gravestones, women's names are left off - they are usually referred to simply as 'the daughter of Mr X', or simply, 'Miss'. In public women are simply referred to as 'the wife of', 'the mother of', or 'the daughter of', a man. Last year Afghan women started an online campaign called #WhereIsMyName, aimed at breaking this taboo and reclaiming women's identities. Laleh Osmani, one of the campaign organisers, was motivated to start the campaign when she came across the death notice of the wife of a famous poet on Facebook. In the notice there was no mention of the name of the deceased, or her female relatives. She realised that even among the intellectual elite, who might be expected to be more open minded, this tradition was being upheld. The women behind the campaign urged clerics and mullahs to help change the culture surrounding women's identities. A lipstick up to the patriarchy: Divya Arya, South Asia Women's Affairs Journalist\nAn unusual rebellion took centre stage in India during the hot summer, featuring hundreds of selfies using the middle finger. The Hindi-language film Lipstick Under My Burkha was finally released in India, examining the lives and desires of four women from small-town India, after a six-month legal tussle with the film censors. It had initially been refused certification for being too \"lady oriented\" with \"continuous sex scenes\", \"abusive words\" and \"audio pornography\". The Censor Board did not elaborate on these objections but it is not unusual for it to suggest cuts or ban films altogether, and film makers often have to approach higher tribunals to get their films passed. In the recent past, the board has been criticised by the film industry for being irrational and making decisions on an inconsistent basis. It has been asked to edit out scenes involving sex and violence, swear words or even a kiss. The director of Lipstick Under My Burkha, Alankrita Shrivastava, told the BBC, \"The Central Board of Film Certification is outdated and illogical. Its members have no idea about gender issues and gender politics.\" Bollywood has traditionally shied away from being very confrontational, but that is changing. For Ms Shrivastava and the makers of her film, just getting the certification (with some cuts) was not enough. They launched a new poster that used lipstick as the middle finger of a woman's hand. The female leads of the film then all posted similar photos, using the hashtag #LipstickRebellion, and the trend caught on. For more than a month, as the film was being shown, both actors and the public - both men and women - posted selfies giving the middle finger to patriarchy. No more 'marry your rapist': Alma Hassoun, Arabic Women's Affairs Journalist\nIn many communities in Arabic cultures, women who have been raped are seen as a source of shame for their families and so the crime is hidden to avoid a scandal. Women are neither socially nor legally supported to speak up and the rapists who are identified are legally exempt from punishment if they marry their victims. It is not easy to explain how powerful this patriarchal mindset is, but it lives in a context in which sex outside of marriage is not acceptable for women. Indeed in many cultures, being a virgin is a prerequisite for future wives. Last summer, Tunisia, Lebanon and Jordan scrapped the laws which saved rapists from jail if they married their victims. This is something local activists have been pushing for for years. In Lebanon, for example, in one of the campaigns more than 30 white wedding dresses were hung from nooses between the palm trees. Earlier, women dressed in wedding dresses made from bandages to protest against the law. Similarly, Jordanians launched an e-campaign to stress their demands. Egypt was the first Arabic country to scrap the law in 1999, but change is slow, and three countries in one year feels like a watershed moment. A full stop to bus stop violence: Abigail Ony Nwaohuocha, Africa Women's Affairs Journalist\nOn 19 July 2017 three men were sentenced to death for robbing, stripping, and sexually assaulting a female passenger for wearing a miniskirt at a public bus stop in Kenya's Githurai district. The case ruling was momentous for women not only in Kenya but all over Africa. This was one of two landmark cases involving the sexual assault and violent robbery of women on public transport in a country where women make up the majority of commuters. For many Kenyan women like Naomi Mwaura, a reproductive health and gender rights activist who helped organise the protest, \"this ruling is the strong message needed to criminalise violence against women and reaffirm the rights of women to live free of violence in public spaces, especially the transport industry\". Three years earlier, in November 2014, hundreds of people came together on the Nairobi streets for a historic march to protest the sexual violence of women in the capital, after a video of the attack surfaced online. The protest was later coined #MyDressMyChoice and influenced the court's decision and became a global movement. The Kenyan's court pronouncement sent a clear signal to the rest of Africa that women's rights are not to be tampered with. \"I feel honoured to have supported the cause,\" said Ms Mwaura who helped organize the protest, \"and most importantly, to see justice in my lifetime.\" What is 100 Women?\nBBC 100 Women names 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year.

        "content": "US President Donald Trump obtained a restraining order against an adult film actress to prevent her from speaking publicly about their alleged affair, legal documents show. Mr Trump's personal lawyer obtained the order against Stormy Daniels in private arbitration proceedings last month. It bars her from sharing \"confidential information\" about their alleged relationship, US media report. Mr Trump says allegations against him are all false. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed to reporters on Wednesday that the president had won arbitration proceedings against the actress, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. \"This case has already been won in arbitration and anything beyond that, I would refer you to the president's outside counsel,\" she said. Mr Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, emailed the restraining order to Ms Clifford's lawyer on 28 February, according to NBC News. \"The document itself is to remain confidential and not to be disclosed to anyone as per the terms of the judge's order,\" the email said. Details of the restraining order have emerged a day after Ms Clifford filed a lawsuit against Mr Trump, alleging that a non-disclosure contract she signed was invalid. She said the agreement, drawn up before the 2016 election, was \"void\" because he had not signed it. The civil lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles on Tuesday, says that only days before the election, Ms Clifford and Mr Cohen signed a \"hush agreement\" but Mr Trump did not, \"thus rendering it legally null and void and of no consequence\". It also refers to last month's \"bogus arbitration proceeding\" where the restraining order was obtained by Mr Cohen. The order, issued on 27 February, bars Ms Clifford from sharing any information related to the non-disclosure agreement. Mr Cohen confirmed last month that he had privately paid Ms Clifford $130,000 (\u00a395,000) but did not say what it was for. He said neither Mr Trump nor the Trump Organization was a party to this transaction. ",

        "content": "Shares in Countrywide, Britain's largest estate agent group, have sunk more than 20% after it warned of tough times in the housing market. Countrywide, whose brands include Bairstow Eves and Gascoigne Pees, posted a sharp fall in profits and said about 150 head office jobs would go. It reported a \u00a3208.1m after-tax loss in 2017, versus a \u00a317.5m profit in 2016. The firm has been hit by a slowdown in the market as well as the growth of online agents such as Purplebricks. The profit figures were also dragged lower by one-off costs as Countrywide continued to restructure the business. But even with these are stripped out, pre-tax profits more than halved to \u00a325.2m, from \u00a352.7m in 2016. Countrywide, which called 2017 \"a disappointing year\", said trading had remained under pressure since the start of 2018 with a pipeline of work \"significantly\" below a year earlier. Cost-cutting drive\nIts previous chief executive, Alison Platt, left last month after a profit warning and announcement of a further restructuring of the business which included investment in digital operations to compete with online rivals. Countrywide said on Thursday that it was shedding about 150 of its 450-strong head office team as part of a cost-cutting drive. The firm employs about 8,000 nationwide. The results announcement laid bare the problems in its core sales and lettings arm, where earnings sank 47% to \u00a314.9m. Across sales and lettings in London, earnings fell 44% to \u00a311.5m. Executive chairman Peter Long admitted that the patience of investors had been \"sorely tested\". He said the group was working to resolve poor performance in sales and lettings, but admitted it would \"take time\". \"We believe these business units are fixable, know what we have to do to restore them and the steps to take that should result in a return to profitable growth.\" Some of the problems facing the housing sector were underlined on Thursday with news that the number of homes on estate agents' books had dwindled to a new low. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said average property stock levels per branch on agents' books fell to a new record low of just under 42, as inquiries from new buyers, new instructions from sellers and newly-agreed sales continued to drift lower in February. New buyer inquiries fell for the 11th month in a row, while sales trends have remained similar over the past six months, Rics said. Where can you afford to live?

England go into the match after a comprehensive defeat in Scotland in their last game, and Jones said: \"We want a response from the players this week. \"Mike Brown has been excellent for us but he was a little bit off against Scotland and we've decided to start Anthony Watson. \"We want to attack a little bit more so Anthony starts at full-back with Elliot Daly on the left and Jonny May right.

At first glance, some of Dima Nachawi's illustrations could show couples from almost anywhere in the world - but the rest of the collection tells a very different story; of air strikes, injuries and death. These pictures illustrate how real people live - and love - in Eastern Ghouta, an area of Syria where conditions have been described as \"hell on earth\" by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. \"They [the residents] still live their daily lives, they still fall in love and try to protect their beloved ones,\" says Dima. Dima grew up in Syria, but left the country a number of years ago and now lives in Beirut, where she has a career as an artist. She has worked on a variety of creative projects, looking at the situation in Syria. This \"Love is...\" collection, published on social media, shows real people and and the effect the conflict has had on their relationships. Each illustration depicts a different, anonymous couple and Dima only reveals a few details about the people she draws. \"This project was very difficult, especially the one in which the woman died,\" she says, describing the image below. \"I was imagining how the illustration was going to look but at the same time it weighed very heavy on my heart. \"It's very difficult to illustrate something that has an unhappy ending.\" \"But I was also grateful that I had this chance to reflect on the other lives of the Syrians, where they survive, they love, they are not victims, they are people that can take action and they have agency. \"This is what I want to reflect through my illustrations.\" Residents are reported to be fleeing the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta enclave as the situation there was described as \"beyond critical\". Some aid has been able to reach the rebel-held area but charities say much more is needed. More than 700 people have been killed in recent weeks, many of them children. Dima is critical of the way the international media portrays the people of Syria. \"On the human level, we are stereotyped as refugees and victims,\" she says. \"I prefer to talk to people [in Syria] to see how they're doing in their daily life and how they are trying to live and survive.\" Dima says she finds it \"very difficult\" to watch the conflict from afar. \"Every time I feel bad, I try to do something. I know that I have followers all around the world and I'm conveying a message, telling those people something that they don't know about Syria. \"I try through illustration and art to do something about it and maybe I can't massively change the current situation but I know that my illustrations are preserving something for the cultural memory, for the next generation to see and know what happened.\" What is 100 Women?\nBBC 100 Women names 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year.

The Italian giants came from behind to win 2-1 in the second leg of their last-16 Champions League tie at Wembley on Wednesday for a 4-3 aggregate win. \"It's the history of Tottenham,\" added the 33-year-old Italy international. \"We knew Tottenham have fantastic players and are an amazing side - but they concede many chances every game.\" After a 2-2 draw in Italy, Son Heung-min put Spurs 3-2 ahead on aggregate before two goals in three second-half minutes - from Gonzalo Higuain and Paulo Dybala - took Juventus, runners-up in 2016-17, into the last eight. Tottenham had late chances, including Harry Kane heading against the post in the 90th minute, but Chiellini excelled as Juve advanced. \"For us it is an amazing night,\" added the centre-back. \"It was very difficult and we knew before this match and also before the first game. But we believed it and believed in the win. \"Tottenham have always created many chances to score - but they miss always something at the end. \"We believe in the history - we saw it yesterday between Paris and Real. The history is important, with experience it is important and we used our skill.\" Despite the defeat, Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino said he was \"proud\" of his side. \"In less than three minutes we conceded two goals - two big mistakes - and that is why we are out,\" said the Argentine. \"In both legs we deserved more. We played fantastic football until that first goal and we dominated.\" Tottenham are fourth in the Premier League and face Swansea in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup and Pochettino expects his team to learn from the experience. \"We are very disappointed, but it is part of growing. We will keep going,\" he added. \"We created a lot of chances, it is clear we deserved a lot more. In football it is not about deserving, you have to score goals and not concede. \"It was tough but very positive for the future. You need this type of game and experience to build you as a player to compete at this level. \"They only came to our goal two or three times - not much - but they have quality so if you make a mistake they will score.\" Former Premier League striker Chris Sutton on BBC Radio 5 live Over the course of the two games - but for 15-20 minutes - Tottenham dominated a big European side. They can count themselves unfortunate, but they will have to learn lessons from it. The most important thing for Spurs is not to lose their heads. It's a disappointing defeat but it's important that there is no wild reaction. Keep this group together. They are building something special and it will come. Keep Kane, keep Alli, and keep the core of this team, and I'm sure they will win a trophy. ",

        "content": "An Indian woman at the centre of an inter-religious marriage row may now live with her husband, the Supreme Court has ruled. Hadiya Jahan, who is in her 20s, was born into a Hindu family, but converted to Islam and married a Muslim man. Her family alleged she was brainwashed as part of an anti-Hindu conspiracy, prompting a lower court to annul the marriage. India's top court has now set aside the ruling, restoring their marriage. Marriages between Hindus and Muslims have long attracted censure in conservative Indian families, but the attachment of a deeper, sinister motive to them is a recent phenomenon. Hadiya Jahan, earlier known by her Hindu name Akhila Asokan, has always insisted that she acted out of her own free will. Radical Hindu fringe groups have described her case as a typical example of \"love jihad\" - a term they use to accuse Muslim men of participating in a \"conspiracy to turn Hindu women from their religion by seducing them\". Ms Jahan and her husband appealed after the high court in the state of Kerala annulled their marriage. The Supreme Court ordered an independent investigation. She was summoned to testify by the top court on whether she had been forced to convert. Ms Jahan told the three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra, that she wanted her freedom and to see her husband, who would support her financially. She also said that she had been kept in \"unlawful custody\" by her parents. In November, a top court bench allowed Ms Jahan to leave her father's custody and resume her studies. ",

Employees will get a 5% bonus, down from 6% last year and the lowest since 1954, when it was 4%. Annual profit, before the partnership bonus, tax and exceptional items, fell 21.9% to \u00a3289.2m. Company chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield said 2017 had been a \"challenging year\", as expected, with \"subdued\" consumer demand. He said weakness in sterling had led to higher costs, putting pressure on the business's profit margin. \"This was why we chose to reduce the proportion of profits paid as partnership bonus last year so as to absorb these impacts while continuing to invest in the future and in strengthening our balance sheet,\" Sir Charlie said. He said the firm remain committed to increasing pay rates for non-management staff, and that the average hourly rate of pay for a non-management workers was \u00a38.91. 'Volatile' year ahead\nLike-for-like sales - which strip out the impact of store openings - at the John Lewis department stores were up 0.4%. At Waitrose, sales returned to growth, with like-for-like sales rising 0.9%. Gross sales for the full-year period were up 2% at \u00a311.6bn. The partnership said it had been hit by exceptional costs of \u00a3282.5m, including \u00a3111.3m on restructuring branch, distribution and retail operations, and another \u00a372.8m on redundancy payments. \"We expect trading to be volatile in 2018-19, with continuing economic uncertainty and no let up in competitive intensity.

The film has been praised for being the first Hollywood superhero movie to have a predominately black cast. The term \"inclusion rider\" was a big feature at the Oscars after being used by Frances McDormand at the end of her best actress acceptance speech. It was invented by media researcher Stacy Smith during a talk in which she came up with ways to show more women, ethnic minorities and people with disabilities on screen. According to the University of Southern California, where Dr Smith is a professor, the concept of an inclusion rider is: \"A-list actors can incorporate a clause in their contracts that stipulates that inclusion, both on camera and behind the scenes for crew members, be reflected in films. \"The rider states that women, people of colour, people with disabilities, and members of LGBT and marginalised communities who are traditionally under-represented be depicted on screen in proportion to their representation in the population.\" Other A-listers have also signalled they are willing to support the cause.

        "content": "Suspected domestic abusers could be electronically tagged under government proposals for England and Wales. The draft Domestic Abuse Bill will also propose tougher sentences where children are involved and more support for victims who testify in court. There is a new definition of economic abuse - if people are denied access to jobs or money, or forced to take loans. Prime Minister Theresa May said the bill could \"completely transform the way we tackle domestic abuse\". Proposed Domestic Abuse Protection Orders (DAPOs) would allow police and courts to intervene earlier where abuse is suspected. The orders would allow courts to electronically monitor suspects' whereabouts before they have been found guilty of - or even committed - a crime. DAPOs would bring together elements from existing protective orders, while giving courts the power to set a wider range of restrictions and for longer periods than the current 28 days. Other measures being considered include: It is estimated that almost two million adults in England and Wales have been victims of domestic abuse in the past year while 95 women and men were killed by current or former partners in 2016-17. 'Ambitious about protecting women'\nHome Secretary Amber Rudd said: \"It is appalling that in 21st-Century Britain, nearly two million people every year - the majority of them women - suffer abuse at the hands of those closest to them.\" Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme Ms Rudd said the new definition of economic abuse would help prosecute perpetrators of domestic violence, who raid their victims' bank accounts or force them to take out loans. She added that judges prescribing \"early intervention initiatives\" such as alcohol treatment programmes for abusers could stop \"behaviour early on\". On International Women's Day she said: \"If we want to be really ambitious about equality, ambitious about protecting women, this is exactly the sort of change we need to take head on.\" Euleen Hope suffered a decade of physical and emotional abuse from her partner for more than a decade. She said she required hospital treatment more than a dozen times and would grow her fringe to cover the black eyes. \"He already said to me he'll say when it's over, and then he told me he'd organise to have someone throw acid in my face [if I left].\" Her former partner was eventually jailed in 2015 for GBH and assault after her sister got in contact with the police. Suzanne Jacob, chief executive of domestic abuse charity SafeLives, said: \"We welcome the focus on the urgent need to hold perpetrators to account and to prioritise the needs and safety of women and girls. \"The time for piecemeal sticking plasters is over, we need radical change.\" Katie Ghose, chief executive of Women's Aid, said the bill was an opportunity to \"include policies on housing, education, health, immigration and the welfare system... to ensure that every survivor and her child can safely escape domestic abuse\". But she cautioned the \"ambition will be undermined if there is not a long-term, sustainable funding plan for refuges in place\". The consultation period for the draft bill will run until 31 May. ",

Mary McAleese was speaking in Rome ahead of the Voices of Faith conference, which features prominent Catholic women from around the world. They are celebrating International Women's Day by demanding a greater say for women in Church governance. Pope Francis has declined to attend their meeting or to celebrate Mass for those attending. Vatican Radio has censored its reports on their demand for gender equality. \"The Catholic Church is one of the last great bastions of misogyny,\" said Mrs McAleese. \"It's an empire of misogyny. \"There are so few leadership roles currently available to women. Mrs McAleese said women do not have strong role models in the Church they can look up to. A Church hierarchy that is \"homophobic and anti-abortion is not the Church of the future\", she added. \"We don't want to be what the Pope describes as 'the strawberry on the cake', she said. \"Our voices stir the winds of change, so we must speak out,\" she added. 'Not appropriate'\nIn previous years this Catholic women's movement has celebrated International Women's Day by meeting inside the Vatican, but this year their list of 2018 speakers did not meet with official approval. Senior Vatican officials are took objection to the inclusion of a Ugandan woman who champions Lesbian and Gay Catholic rights in her country, where homosexuality is a crime. They also excluded Tina Beattie, an English Catholic professor of theology. Irish-born US cardinal Kevin Farrell, a senior Vatican official, said it was \"not appropriate\" for the women to be taking part in the conference. The meeting is now taking place in the headquarters of the Jesuit religious order just across the road from Vatican City. Pope Francis has said he supports greater inclusion of women in top Vatican jobs, but is not in favour of allowing women to be ordained as priests. ",

        "content": "An anti-census campaigner in New Zealand was hoping to avoid Wednesday's compulsory national count by hiding in a Tardis, it's reported. The self-styled Laird McGillicuddy, otherwise known as Graeme Cairns, said he was using the Doctor Who time-travelling space craft to boycott the five-yearly census by \"travelling in time\", the New Zealand Herald reports. Mr Cairns, who was once the leader of the satirical McGillicuddy Serious Party, has a history of unusual stunts to protest against the census, which is compulsory for all New Zealanders. He once claimed not to be in New Zealand by hovering above the city of Hamilton in a hot-air balloon, and on another occasion declared himself \"temporarily dead\". He risks a fine of up to NZ$500 (US$362; \u00a3261) for refusing to fill out the form, the Stuff.co.nz website says. Five years ago, there were around 100 prosecutions for census avoidance. Census concerns\nWhile most of New Zealand's approximate 4.7m population were taking part in the census, there were some concerns that the results may be skewed due to accessibility problems. The census was conducted primarily online, but Stuff.co.nz said some people who requested paper versions of the form had not received them; while some blind New Zealanders said they had experienced real difficulties completing the forms. The opposition New Zealand National Party said a lack of disabled access to the forms meant that \"it's likely the results will be skewed, because so many people from this sector of society won't be represented\". It's a concern echoed among the country's indigenous population, with Maori Television saying that \"Kaumatua (Maori elders), the disabled and youth seem to be particularly at risk of being left out\" because they're not online, or have not received the access codes required to access the forms. With the census being a tool to help the government make decisions about future funding, there are fears that groups most in need of government assistance may not be counted accurately.

        "content": "Danish inventor Peter Madsen has denied murdering Swedish journalist Kim Wall on his homemade submarine, at the opening of his trial in Copenhagen. Mr Madsen has admitted dismembering the 30-year-old's body and disposing of it at sea, but says she died accidentally. Her remains were found by a passing cyclist, 11 days after she interviewed the inventor last August. Mr Madsen is charged with murder, dismemberment and aggravated sexual assault. He faces a life sentence if convicted, which typically means 15 to 17 years in prison without parole. At the beginning of his trial on Thursday, his lawyer told judges he denied murder but admitted \"violating the law about indecent handling of a corpse\". Around 40 witnesses are set to give evidence, as prosecutors attempt to shed light on the circumstances of Wall's death. What do we know about what happened?\nKim Wall, a freelance journalist, boarded Peter Madsen's UC3 Nautilus on the evening of 10 August 2017 to interview him for a story. She had left her boyfriend at a going-away party the couple were having ahead of a planned move to Beijing. When she did not return, her boyfriend alerted the police. Peter Madsen was rescued the next morning as his vessel was sinking. He initially told police that he had dropped off the reporter before the vessel began to go down. But he later said she died when a heavy hatch on the submarine fell on her head. Eleven days later, a cyclist found the remains of the journalist's headless torso on a nearby beach. Weeks later, police divers discovered other parts of her body in plastic bags weighed down with metal. The 47-year-old Dane - the skipper and designer of the Nautilus, a 17m- (56ft) long privately-owned submarine - changed his version of events several times. After saying a hatch fell on her head, he maintained instead that she had been killed by carbon monoxide poisoning inside the submarine while he was up on deck.

        "content": "Women workers in Spain are marking International Women's Day with an unprecedented strike targeting gender inequality and sexual discrimination. Work was being halted as part of a 24-hour strike organised by the 8 March Commission and backed by 10 unions and some of Spain's top women politicians. Hundreds of marches with the slogan \"if we stop, the world stops\" are planned. International Women's Day events are also being held in dozens of other nations across the world. What's happening in Spain?\nWomen taking part will stop work and have been urged by organisers to spend no money and ditch any domestic chores for the day. One of the effects will be the cancellation of 300 trains on Thursday, the transport ministry said, with Madrid's underground network also disrupted. Marches in Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Valencia and a number of other cities were leading events in 200 Spanish locations. The 8 March Commission is behind the strike. Its manifesto calls for \"a society free of sexist oppression, exploitation and violence\" and says: \"We do not accept worse working conditions, nor being paid less than men for the same work.\" El Pais said most sectors would be affected and a poll of 1,500 people for the daily newspaper suggested 82% supported the strike, while 76% thought women in Spain had harder lives than men. Feminist groups only want women to strike, to show how important their absence is, but Spanish law does not allow for single-gender strikes and men were welcome to support it. Some have opposed the strike. The ruling centre-right party, the Partido Popular (PP), said the action was \"for feminist elites and not real women with everyday problems\". However, two of the five female ministers in Spain's conservative government, Agriculture Minister Isabel Garc\u00eda Tejerina and the president of the Madrid region Cristina Cifuentes, have said they will be observing a day of work-to-rule. Actress Penelope Cruz cancelled planned public events and said she would go on \"domestic\" strike. The mayors of Madrid and Barcelona - Manuela Carmena and Ada Colau - are also backing the strike. In Spain, women were paid 13% and 19% less than their male counterparts in the public and private sectors respectively, data from the European Union's statistical provider Eurostat said.

The woman, who has not been officially named, was found guilty of \"encouraging moral corruption\", Tehran prosecutor Abbas Jafari-Dolatabadi said. He added that 21 months of the woman's sentence had been suspended and that she was in need of medical treatment. It follows dozens of similar arrests of Iranian women in recent weeks. Most of those detained for defying the country's strict law on appearing in public in a headscarf have been released without charge. The woman sentenced in the capital, Tehran, on Wednesday was jailed for three months without parole. She is \"in need of long-term medical treatment and has to be seen by a psychiatrist\", Mr Jafari-Dolatabadi said. He criticised the suspension of the majority of her sentence and argued that she should serve the full term of her penalty. In December, an Iranian woman who was detained after defiantly taking off her headscarf and holding it on a stick in Tehran became the face of protests in the country. Images of her standing on a telecoms box in a busy street in the city were widely shared on social media. The woman was later freed. The photograph of the woman was first widely used in connection to the White Wednesday campaign in which women in Iran wear white to protest against the country's strict dress code. Since the Iranian revolution in 1979, women have been forced to cover their hair according to Islamic law on modesty. ",

Arsenal twitterdom has found an innovative way to call for an end to Arsene Wenger's 21-year tenure as manager: by comparing him to former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe. Comparisons between the two men have been the basis for jokes all season long, but the meme really took off after Arsenal's 2-1 defeat to Brighton over the weekend. And the heat on Wenger has only continued in advance of Thursday's Europa League match against AC Milan. Thousands chimed in. I\u2019ve always wondered what it would take for Wenger to be sacked.

Two notes were attached that simply read: \"Try Carndonagh, Co Donegal.\" \"How this got here, I just don't know,\" Mr Crumlish told BBC Radio Foyle. \"There was nobody in the house when it arrived so it was just left outside in one of my cars.\" He said neither the name nor address on the parcel were readable in any way, adding that two local postmen had somehow figured out where it was to go. \"I've been talking to the postman, John from Moville,\" said Mr Crumlish. \"Between himself and another postman they have done a bit of head-storming and came up with the idea: 'It must be for Shane.'\" Mr Crumlish said a few years ago he often ordered collectibles, and was a frequent recipient of similar parcels. \"They must have figured it from there,\" he said.

Employees will get a 5% bonus, down from 6% last year and the lowest since 1954, when it was 4%. Annual group profit, before the partnership bonus, tax and exceptional items, fell 21.9% to \u00a3289.2m. John Lewis Partnership chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield said 2017 had been a \"challenging year\", as expected, with \"subdued\" consumer demand. He said weakness in sterling had led to higher costs, putting pressure on the business's profit margin. \"This was why we chose to reduce the proportion of profits paid as partnership bonus last year so as to absorb these impacts while continuing to invest in the future and in strengthening our balance sheet,\" Sir Charlie said. He said the firm remained committed to increasing pay rates for non-management staff, and that the average hourly rate of pay for a non-management workers was \u00a38.91. 'Volatile' year ahead\nLike-for-like sales - which strip out the impact of store openings - at the John Lewis department stores were up 0.4%. At Waitrose, sales returned to growth, with like-for-like sales rising 0.9%. Gross sales for the full-year period were up 2% at \u00a311.6bn. The partnership said it had been hit by exceptional costs of \u00a3282.5m, including \u00a3111.3m on restructuring branch, distribution and retail operations, and another \u00a372.8m on redundancy payments. It said 1,440 members of staff had left the business through redundancy in the past year. There was a a 77% fall in pre-tax profits to \u00a3103.9m. \"We expect trading to be volatile in 2018-19, with continuing economic uncertainty and no let up in competitive intensity. We therefore anticipate further pressure on profits,\" John Lewis said. How does the John Lewis Partnership work?\nFashion boost\nThe company said that its John Lewis stores had increased its market share in fashion, homewares, electrical goods and home technology, with sales in the latter category up by 2.6%. Fashion sales climbed 3.2%, boosted by a strong performance in womenswear, up 5.0%. Sales of its own-brand womenswear rose 14.9%.

        "content": "Suspected domestic abusers could be electronically tagged under government proposals for England and Wales. The draft Domestic Abuse Bill will also propose tougher sentences where children are involved and more support for victims who testify in court. There is a new definition of economic abuse - if people are denied access to jobs or money, or forced to take loans. Prime Minister Theresa May said the bill could \"completely transform the way we tackle domestic abuse\". Proposed Domestic Abuse Protection Orders (DAPOs) would allow police and courts to intervene earlier where abuse is suspected. The orders would allow courts to electronically monitor suspects' whereabouts before they have been found guilty of - or even committed - a crime. DAPOs would bring together elements from existing protective orders, while giving courts the power to set a wider range of restrictions and for longer periods than the current 28 days. Other measures being considered include: It is estimated that almost two million adults in England and Wales have been victims of domestic abuse in the past year while 95 women and men were killed by current or former partners in 2016-17. 'Ambitious about protecting women'\nHome Secretary Amber Rudd said: \"It is appalling that in 21st-Century Britain, nearly two million people every year - the majority of them women - suffer abuse at the hands of those closest to them.\" Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme Ms Rudd said the new definition of economic abuse would help prosecute perpetrators of domestic violence, who raid their victims' bank accounts or force them to take out loans. She added that judges prescribing \"early intervention initiatives\" such as alcohol treatment programmes for abusers could stop \"behaviour early on\". On International Women's Day she said: \"If we want to be really ambitious about equality, ambitious about protecting women, this is exactly the sort of change we need to take head on.\" Euleen Hope suffered a decade of physical and emotional abuse from her partner for more than a decade. She said she required hospital treatment more than a dozen times and would grow her fringe to cover the black eyes. \"He already said to me he'll say when it's over, and then he told me he'd organise to have someone throw acid in my face [if I left].\" Her former partner was eventually jailed in 2015 for GBH and assault after her sister got in contact with the police. Suzanne Jacob, chief executive of domestic abuse charity SafeLives, said: \"We welcome the focus on the urgent need to hold perpetrators to account and to prioritise the needs and safety of women and girls. \"The time for piecemeal sticking plasters is over, we need radical change.\" Katie Ghose, chief executive of Women's Aid, said the bill was an opportunity to \"include policies on housing, education, health, immigration and the welfare system... to ensure that every survivor and her child can safely escape domestic abuse\". But she cautioned the \"ambition will be undermined if there is not a long-term, sustainable funding plan for refuges in place\". The consultation period for the draft bill will run until 31 May. ",

        "content": "Counter-terrorism officers are working to uncover the origin of the nerve agent used in the attempted murder of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury. The pair are still critically ill after being found on a bench in Salisbury. A police officer, who was in intensive care, is now \"stable and conscious\", Wiltshire's chief constable said. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the nerve agent used was \"very rare\" and denied the UK's response was soft. She told Radio 4's Today: \"Let me be clear, we are absolutely robust about any crimes committed on these streets of the UK.\" Police said government scientists had identified the nerve agent used, but would not make that information public at this stage. The source familiar with the investigation told the BBC it was likely to be rarer than the Sarin gas thought to have been used in Syria and in an attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995. And it was said not to be VX - the nerve agent used to kill the half brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Malaysia last year. Col Skripal, 66, was convicted of passing secrets to MI6 but was given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a \"spy swap\". It is known that he and his 33-year-old daughter had visited the Bishop's Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found collapsed on a bench near the Maltings shopping centre. A witness, who saw the pair at the restaurant, told the BBC Mr Skripal was acting \"very strange\" and was \"very agitated\". \"He seemed to lose his temper... and he just started screaming at the top of his voice, he wanted his bill and he wanted to go.\" Police have yet to say if they know how and where the poison was administered. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said Russia was becoming an \"ever greater threat\", amid speculation the attack could have some element of state involvement. \"Russia's being assertive, Russia's being more aggressive, and we have to change the way that we deal with it because we can't be in a situation in these areas of conflict where we are being pushed around by another nation,\" he told ITV's Good Morning Britain. Police said they wanted to speak to anyone who was in the centre of Salisbury on Sunday afternoon. They are particularly keen to hear from people who ate at Zizzi or drank in the Bishop's Mill pub between 13:00 and 16:00 GMT. Both sites remain closed to the public. There is also a cordon in place outside Mr Skripal's Salisbury home and part of a business park in nearby Amesbury. Speaking on Wednesday, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said: \"This is being treated as a major incident involving attempted murder, by administration of a nerve agent. He said Col Skripal and his daughter were \"targeted specifically\". \"Our role now of course is to establish who is behind this and why they carried out this act,\" he added. Nerve agents are highly toxic chemicals that stop the nervous system working and shut down bodily functions. They normally enter the body through the mouth or nose, but can also be absorbed through the eyes or skin. Mr Rowley said there was no evidence of a widespread health risk to the public. 'State responsibility'\nHundreds of detectives, forensic officers, analysts and intelligence officers are working on the case, which has drawn comparison with the killing of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko with radioactive polonium-210 in London in 2006. A public inquiry concluded his death was probably carried out with the approval of President Vladimir Putin. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs on Tuesday the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the Skripal case. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, but is open to co-operating with British police if requested. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said foreign media had used the case as part of an anti-Russian campaign. Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal is a retired Russian military intelligence officer who was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Col Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years. Do you have any information to share on this story?

        "content": "Architect Balkrishna Doshi, known for his pioneering work in low-cost housing, has won this year's prestigious Pritzker Prize. Doshi, 90, is the first Indian to win the award, which is regarded as the highest honour in the field. \"Balkrishna Doshi has always created an architecture that is serious, never flashy or a follower of trends,\" said the Pritzker jury. Over a career spanning six decades, Doshi became one of the most influential architects of post-independence India, fusing international modernist principles with local traditions. The jury added that Doshi \"constantly demonstrates that all good architecture and urban planning must not only unite purpose and structure but must take into account climate, site, technique, and craft, along with a deep understanding and appreciation of the context in the broadest sense\". Doshi thanked the jury and said in a statement that his works \"are an extension of my life, philosophy and dreams trying to create treasury of the architectural spirit\". \"Every object around us, and nature itself - lights, sky, water and storm - everything is in a symphony,\" Doshi was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency. Doshi studied in Mumbai, before travelling to Paris in the 1950s to work for the Franco-Swiss pioneer and iconic 20th century Modernist, Le Corbusier. He stands out for his wide-ranging work in buildings, which include academic institutions, mixed-use complexes, housing projects, public spaces, galleries and private residences. One of his favourite housing projects is one that he designed for Life Insurance Corporation in the western city of Ahmedabad. \"Here I knew that the houses would be occupied by several generations of the same family, that they would identify with it, that there will be a strong sense of belonging and that their needs will change, and that they may modify parts of it,\" Doshi said in a press release. Known for reimagining low-cost housing, his design of one such scheme in the central city of Indore has more than 6,500 homes for some 80,000 low to middle income people. A system of houses, courtyards and a labyrinth of internal pathways make it one of the most notable low-cost housing schemes in India. \"It seems I should take an oath and remember it for my lifetime: to provide the lowest class with the proper dwelling,\" Doshi said in 1954. Doshi began studying architecture in 1947, the year India gained independence, at Mumbai's famous Sir JJ School of Architecture. And many of his notable works also include structures of institutions, like a top management school in the southern city of Bangalore. In an interview with CNN, Doshi said that by winning this award, he hopes to draw attention to the infrastructure of social housing in India. \"These people have nothing - no land, no place, no employment,\" he said. \"But if the government gives them a little piece of land, they can get a feeling of, 'I'm going to work hard, and find a way to build my own home.' If you put them together as a community, there's cooperation, there's sharing, there's understanding and there's this whole diffusion of religion, caste, custom and occupation.\" He will be awarded $100,000 (\u00a380,591) at a ceremony in Toronto in May. Previous winners of the coveted prize include J\u00f8rn Utzon who designed the Sydney Opera House, Oscar Niemeyer of Brazil and the British-Iraqi designer, Zaha Hadid. Photos courtesy VSF, AFP ",

        "content": "South Africa's Rivonia Trial, which saw Nelson Mandela and other anti-apartheid activists jailed, was a key moment in the country's struggle for freedom. Now, more than 60 years later, all of the roughly 300 hours of proceedings are available to listen to for the first time. The BBC's Gavin Fischer, who has a personal connection to the trial, looks at what the tapes can reveal. The Rivonia Trial, lasting from October 1963 to June 1964, has been well documented as a pivotal point in the fight against the white minority government in South Africa. It brought Nelson Mandela to the world stage. His famous speech from the dock, declaring that freedom and equality was \"an ideal for which I am prepared to die\", became a rallying cry for black people under the apartheid regime, and set the young lawyer on a path to become the country's first democratically elected president 30 years later. It could have been very different. Mandela and his co-accused faced the death penalty for acts of sabotage against the state. It was my great-uncle, Bram Fischer, who led their defence team, and was part of saving their lives. He took great risks in getting involved, as he was also an anti-apartheid activist who could himself have been in the dock at the Rivonia Trial. More myth than man to me\nIn fact, just a few years later, he too would be arrested and sentenced to life in prison. Seen as a traitor to his own white, Afrikaner people, he was badly mistreated and died while still in custody in 1975, before I was born. But by being given access to the newly digitised tapes from the Rivonia Trial, I have been able to go back to a time before tragedy overtook Bram's life. It's been my first chance to hear him speak. Polite to all he addresses, his calm tones are shot through with a seam of fierce authority. Eyes shut and headphones on, I listen. For the first time my great uncle, who has been more myth than man to me, starts to become real. The Rivonia Trial is itself now steeped in a kind of myth, part of the great story of South Africa's journey to freedom. The new recordings give the opportunity to hear some of the journey's most famous moments. There's the searing power of Mandela's speech, Walter Sisulu's impressive philosophical outwitting of the prosecutor, Elias Motsoaledi's humble but striking detailing of the life of black people in South Africa, and even the defiant humour of Ahmed Kathrada and Denis Goldberg. Immersing myself in the recordings, I've been able to forget the historical significance of these moments and simply be overawed by them. Not knowing what the future held, these men didn't beg for clemency or deny their actions, they used the trial to highlight the injustice being perpetrated by the government. To hear them speak is a privilege. I have also found myself getting lost in some of the trial's more mundane moments: the background chatter, the scraping of chairs, the thuds and silences as the recording equipment is adjusted. I revel in it all as the sounds swell and fall, pulling me back to that time. Then, from the midst of the crackle and hiss of the recordings, come moments of startling resonance I never knew existed and which are rarely documented in the story of the Rivonia Trial. Thomas Mashifane was a state witness, tortured into giving evidence against the accused. He had worked at a farm called Liliesleaf in Johannesburg, which Mandela and others had used as a hideout. He knew nothing of their activities, and his testimony is filled with innocuous detail, irrelevant to the case. Yet, at its end, he speaks up, unprompted, about being beaten and humiliated by the police. I can't breathe for the horror of it. I want to shrink from what white people did back then; but I also want to run over and hug him for forcing the court to hear what really happened. When I get to that moment, I have to take my headphones off, I just cannot sit in that courtroom any more. Weeks later, I meet Mr Mashifane's daughter Elizabeth. She's kind, though her manner is distant, hardened in preparation for reliving her father's ordeal. But as I play her the tape, this strength seems to drain away. It's the first time she has ever heard this testimony. \"It makes me feel like it happened yesterday,\" she tells me. As she listens, Elizabeth looks away from me, lost in her father's words. I try to fill the silence that follows, searching for something - anything - positive to say. I end up asking if she is proud of the fact that he spoke up. For a moment, her eyes turn back to me. \"But did it make any difference?\" she asks. No answer is necessary. Turning away again, she says more quietly: \"None of them were treated like humans.\" Thwadi Makena was also a labourer at Liliesleaf, and the only one left alive today. When I meet him, he strikes me as a quiet, humble man. Yet, as I play him the tape of himself giving evidence, Mr Makena's thin face comes alive and he chuckles with delight. \"I feel very excited to hear my voice after so many years. It's just so amazing - I can't believe it,\" he tells me. As with most of those I have spoken to, recalling details of the case turns Mr Makena's mood more sombre. He was held by police, made to feel like a criminal and says the impact it had remains to this day. \"I tend to feel they might come back and say some new information has been revealed and [I] need to come and make some confession,\" he says. \"That fear has always been there.\" Not an end, but a beginning\nWhile the recordings contain details which can bring back difficult memories, in playing them to those closest to the trial, I have found all have appreciated the chance to hear voices they thought lost forever. It is clear even short snippets of tape can help reclaim these stories from the dehumanising mass of the apartheid state. Laws may have changed since democracy was won, but grinding structural injustice remains a reality for so many South Africans. I too often lose these individuals' stories in an effort to find sense in the state of this country. The more tales of poverty I hear, the less I understand the cause or the solution. So these tapes have a lesson for me: don't become numb. Listening is at least a start. There is no chance to hear the verdicts of the trial. Those tapes haven't been found. Maybe we'll never hear the moments when the judge showed what little mercy he could find, in the law and in himself, sentencing all the accused to life in prison. Life, not death. Not an end, but a beginning. Maybe even the beginning of a new chapter in the country's history. But as the audio plays, that story is still in the future. The tapes fuzz and hiss and you can sense the tension of what might come to pass. In these moments, the Rivonia Trial feels not so much of the past, but of the present. As I listen, my great uncle is still alive and the people around me suffer, fight and survive, not knowing what their future holds. ",

        "content": "Phil Neville urged England women to \"remember the pain\" of losing to the United States in the SheBelieves Cup. The Lionesses needed a point against the hosts in Orlando to win the four-team tournament on goal difference - but lost to a second-half own goal by goalkeeper Karen Bardsley. Neville told his players to stay on the pitch afterwards and watch the US lift the trophy. \"Defeat hurts and you hope next time it kicks them on,\" said the head coach. Neville was looking to win the invitational tournament in his first three games as a first-team senior manager. A 4-1 victory over France was followed by a 2-2 draw against Olympic champions Germany. The comprehensive win over France meant they just needed to draw against the USA to finish above them on goal difference. Ellen White almost equalised late on but her header hit the post, but Neville, 41, said the experience will help them at next summer's Women's World Cup in France. \"Sometimes you've got to see the opposition lift a trophy because it sticks with you, and the next time we come to SheBelieves or another competition, you hope they remember this pain,\" he said. \"I've stayed balanced throughout the tournament because were on a journey. They've taken on board so many messages since we've been together and embraced what I've wanted. As a manager, that's all you can ask. Media playback is not supported on this device \"I think we're where we want to be. We're challenging the best teams in the world and people are starting to talk about England.\" Neville said a nervous start was partly to blame for his side's defeat against a team ranked number one in the world. \"I wanted them to enjoy today and play with freedom and a smile on their faces,\" he said. \"I think there was a real hunger in the last 30 minutes that we probably didn't show in the first 30 minutes. \"But we were up against a real quality team who played like the number one team in the world. That's the challenge now for us - to get there.\" It was the third game in a row that Chelsea defender Millie Bright has been involved in an opposition goal. Gaetane Thiney's shot for France in the opener hit Bright's back before going in - but it was awarded to the attacker rather than as an own goal. The defender then scored an own goal against Germany when a Siobhan Chamberlain clearance ricocheted off her and into the net. Against the US, Bright's clearance hit Bardsley and went in. Media playback is not supported on this device \"There's nothing you can say,\" said Neville. \"She's performed brilliantly. She played the first game when she was sick and was outstanding in the second. \"She just gets on with it and doesn't demand too much attention. \"These things happen. You have runs of games where luck goes against you but I just want her to continue to play at the standards she's set at this tournament and if she does that she'll have no problems.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Neville said growing belief will be key to his side's hopes of becoming world champions in 2019. He said: \"We want to close the gap in 12 months' time. We're improving step by step but we have to show more self-belief and character in terms of getting on the ball. \"But I've got some young players who realised after 50 minutes they can play in that arena. Next time they play against the USA, they will be better for this experience.\" England are next in action on 6 April when they play Women's World Cup qualifying group one leaders Wales in Southampton. The Lionesses have won their opening three qualifying matches and are trying to secure their place at the finals in France next year. ",

Between Sunday and Tuesday, the RAC received 218 calls for breakdowns relating to potholes, compared with 104 between February and March. It says the extreme cold weather has caused freezing water to get into cracks on already bad road surfaces. The Department for Transport said it was investing \u00a323bn on roads. Local councils fix a pothole every 19 seconds, according to the Local Government Association. Driving into them can cause broken suspension springs, damaged shock absorbers and distorted wheels. The RAC said consequences from the cold snap could last for years to come as conditions \"wreak havoc\" on the roads. \"Our roads were already in a poor state of repair before the extreme cold weather hit. \"We fear this spring may see the emergence of almost as many potholes as daffodils.\" Meanwhile, charity Cycling UK has warned potholes pose a high risk of personal injury or in the worst cases death.

A Department for Transport spokesman said it was investing a \"record\" \u00a323 billion on roads. \"We know road surfaces are a concern for all road users and that is why we are providing local highway authorities in England, with just under \u00a36 billion to help improve the condition of our local highway networks. \"We are also giving local authorities a record \u00a3296 million through the pothole action fund - that's enough to fix just under 6 million potholes.\" ",

        "content": "A man has pleaded not guilty to stealing actress Frances McDormand's Oscar after Sunday's ceremony. McDormand was named best actress - but her statuette briefly went missing at the lavish after-show Governor's Ball. Terry Bryant filmed himself holding a statuette and telling other guests he was a winner, before being arrested. His lawyer Daniel Brookman said: \"There's a difference between holding an Oscar and what he is charged with, so that will play out in court.\" The 47-year-old had been in police custody on a grand theft charge, but was released without having to pay bail following Wednesday's hearing after the judge ruled he did not pose a flight risk. Judge Deborah Brazil heard testimony from his rabbi Naomi Levy, who described him as a \"sweet, gentle man of faith\". Ms Levy added: \"I think we are living in an unusual time in America. I believe that maybe perhaps his story is a commentary on our whole society and its obsession with its 15 minutes of fame.\" Police said Mr Bryant was a ticket holder for the Governor's Ball. He was ordered to return to court on 28 March. Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said he faces up to three years in jail if convicted. The Oscar was retrieved and later returned to McDormand, who won for her role in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. It's the actress's second Oscar, 21 years after her first for Fargo.

        "content": "Counter-terrorism officers are working to uncover the origin of the nerve agent used in the attempted murder of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury. The pair are still critically ill after being found on a bench in Salisbury. A police officer, who was in intensive care, is now \"stable and conscious\", Wiltshire's chief constable said. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the nerve agent used was \"very rare\" and denied the UK's response was soft. A Downing Street spokesman said the attack was an \"appalling and reckless crime\" and those responsible would face a \"robust\" response. Police said government scientists had identified the nerve agent used, but would not make that information public at this stage. The source familiar with the investigation told the BBC it was likely to be rarer than the Sarin gas thought to have been used in Syria and in an attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995. And it was said not to be VX - the nerve agent used to kill the half brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Malaysia last year. Col Skripal, 66, was convicted of passing secrets to MI6 but was given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a \"spy swap\". It is known that he and his 33-year-old daughter had visited the Bishop's Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found collapsed on a bench near the Maltings shopping centre. A witness, who saw the pair at the restaurant, told the BBC Mr Skripal was acting \"very strange\" and was \"very agitated\". \"He seemed to lose his temper... and he just started screaming at the top of his voice, he wanted his bill and he wanted to go.\" Police have yet to say if they know how and where the poison was administered. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said Russia was becoming an \"ever greater threat\", amid speculation the attack could have some element of state involvement. \"Russia's being assertive, Russia's being more aggressive, and we have to change the way that we deal with it because we can't be in a situation in these areas of conflict where we are being pushed around by another nation,\" he told ITV's Good Morning Britain. Police said they wanted to speak to anyone who was in the centre of Salisbury on Sunday afternoon. They are particularly keen to hear from people who ate at Zizzi or drank in the Mill pub between 13:00 and 16:00 GMT. Both sites remain closed to the public. There is also a cordon in place outside Mr Skripal's Salisbury home and part of a business park in nearby Amesbury. Speaking on Wednesday, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said: \"This is being treated as a major incident involving attempted murder, by administration of a nerve agent. He said Col Skripal and his daughter were \"targeted specifically\". \"Our role now of course is to establish who is behind this and why they carried out this act,\" he added. Nerve agents are highly toxic chemicals that stop the nervous system working and shut down bodily functions. They normally enter the body through the mouth or nose, but can also be absorbed through the eyes or skin. Mr Rowley said there was no evidence of a widespread health risk to the public. 'State responsibility'\nHundreds of detectives, forensic officers, analysts and intelligence officers are working on the case, which has drawn comparison with the killing of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko with radioactive polonium-210 in London in 2006. A public inquiry concluded his death was probably carried out with the approval of President Vladimir Putin. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs on Tuesday the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the Skripal case. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, but is open to co-operating with British police if requested. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said foreign media had used the case as part of an anti-Russian campaign. Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal is a retired Russian military intelligence officer who was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Col Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years. Do you have any information to share on this story?

        "content": "A robot that can solve a Rubik's cube puzzle in 0.38 seconds has been developed by two researchers in the US. The current world record is 0.637 seconds, which was set by German engineer Albert Beer and his robot Sub1 Reloaded. The researchers realised they could solve the cube more quickly by using a different type of motor in their robot. They suggested the contraption could be tweaked to go faster but said they had \"lost interest\" in tuning the device. End of Youtube post by Ben Katz Ben Katz, a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, collaborated with Jared Di Carlo to create the robot. \"We noticed that all of the fast Rubik's Cube solvers were using stepper motors and thought that we could do better if we used better motors,\" said Mr Di Carlo in a blog post. Mr Katz said in his blog the 0.38 seconds included \"image capture and computation time, as well as actually moving the cube\". Their contraption used two PlayStation Eye cameras from the old PS3 console to identify the configuration of the cube. However, mistakes often resulted in a cube being destroyed. The system also had difficulty identifying the difference between the red and orange sides of the cube, so the researchers scribbled on the orange sides with a black marker pen. The motors took about 10 milliseconds to turn a side of the cube, with each move taking about 15 milliseconds in total. Mr Katz suggested the machine could be refined but described the process as \"time consuming\". \"For the time being, Jared and I have both lost interest in playing the tuning game, but we might come back to it eventually and shave off another 100 milliseconds or so,\" he wrote. The current record held by Mr Beer was recognised by Guinness World Records in 2017. ",

        "content": "A crowdfunding campaign has raised more than $33,000 (\u00a324,000) for the South African athlete who was attacked by a gang who tried to saw his legs off. The fund was set up on Wednesday after news of the horrific attack on Mhlengi Gwala began to spread around the world. He was doing triathlon training in Durban when he was pulled into bushes by attackers who used a chainsaw to cut into his legs before he escaped. He is now \"doing well\" after surgery, an official told the BBC. Dennis Jackson, director of the elite athlete programme for KwaZulu-Natal province, told the BBC's Newsday programme they would be doing everything possible to get Mr Gwala back on his feet. Mr Jackson said he was sure Mr Gwala - a \"shining ambassador\" for triathlon in South Africa - would compete again, although at what level remained to be seen. But he added: \"Don't be surprised if in a year or two, we see him back on the world stage.\" The story sent shockwaves through South Africa and beyond, leading one South African to set up the BackaBuddy fundraising page to \"get Mhlengi back on his bike\". The money raised - which stood at 400,000 rand ($33,550; \u00a324,175) as of Thursday morning - will help with medical bills and rehabilitation costs, the site says. Mr Gwala was due to compete in the South African national championships this month and has twice represented the country in international competitions. His money, phone and bicycle were not stolen and the motive for the attack is still unclear. Mr Jackson paid tribute to the athlete's determination and mental strength: \"Like a lot of young kids, he had a bit of trouble growing up but he decided that he wanted to change his life and take up sport, and that's what he did. \"So when people ask me now: 'Is he going to overcome this?' I say, 'For sure. He's got the mind, he's got the will, he's got the strength.'\" ",

        "content": "Danish inventor Peter Madsen has denied murdering Swedish journalist Kim Wall on his homemade submarine, at the opening of his trial in Copenhagen. Mr Madsen has admitted dismembering the 30-year-old's body and disposing of it at sea, but says she died accidentally. Her remains were found by a passing cyclist, 11 days after she interviewed the inventor last August. Mr Madsen is charged with murder, dismemberment and aggravated sexual assault. He faces a life sentence if convicted, which typically means 15 to 17 years in prison without parole. Around 40 witnesses are set to give evidence, as prosecutors attempt to shed light on the circumstances of Wall's death. What do we know about what happened?\nKim Wall, a freelance journalist, boarded Peter Madsen's UC3 Nautilus on the evening of 10 August 2017 to interview him for a story. She had left her boyfriend at a going-away party the couple were having ahead of a planned move to Beijing. When she did not return, her boyfriend alerted the police. Peter Madsen was rescued the next morning as his vessel was sinking. He initially told police that he had dropped off the reporter before the vessel began to go down. But he later said she died when a heavy hatch on the submarine fell on her head. Eleven days later, a cyclist found the remains of the journalist's headless torso on a nearby beach. Weeks later, police divers discovered other parts of her body in plastic bags weighed down with metal. The 47-year-old Dane - the skipper and designer of the Nautilus, a 17m- (56ft) long privately-owned submarine - changed his version of events several times. After saying a hatch fell on her head, he maintained instead that she had been killed by carbon monoxide poisoning inside the submarine while he was up on deck. He initially denied cutting up her body, but then admitted dismembering it and dumping the body parts in the sea. What has been said in court?\nPeter Madsen appeared calm on Thursday, wearing a black t-shirt, jeans and black glasses, but he did not address the court. Members of the Wall family were also in the session. His lawyer Betina Hald Engmark told the court he denied murder but admitted \"violating the law about indecent handling of a corpse\". The BBC's Maddy Savage, in the courtroom, says prosecutors have been setting out their evidence against the inventor. During the session, the prosecution said: Prosecution wants to make the argument that #KimWall's death was murder and it was premeditated #SubmarineTrial #PeterMadsen End of Twitter post by @maddysavage More than 100 journalists from all around the world were registered to cover the high-profile trial, expected to last 12 days spread over seven weeks. A verdict is expected on 25 April. Who was Kim Wall?\nThe journalist was born in 1987 and grew up in a close-knit community in the small town of Trelleborg in southern Sweden, just across the strait dividing Denmark from Sweden. She studied international relations at London School of Economics and went on to gain a place on the rigorous masters programme of Columbia University's School of Journalism - described as the \"Oxbridge of journalism\". She had a long career in journalism, having previously reported from North Korea, the South Pacific, Uganda and Haiti, writing for the New York Times, Guardian, Vice and the South China Morning Post.

        "content": "The attempted murder of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, using a nerve agent was a \"brazen and reckless attack\", Amber Rudd has said. The home secretary told MPs the attack in Salisbury was \"attempted murder in the most cruel and public way\". Counter-terrorism officers are working to uncover the origin of the nerve agent used in Sunday's attack. A police officer, who was in intensive care, is now \"stable and conscious\", Wiltshire's chief constable said. Both Col Skripal and his daughter are still critically ill after being found on a bench. Speaking earlier, Ms Rudd said the nerve agent used was \"very rare\" and denied the UK's response was soft. A Downing Street spokesman said the attack was an \"appalling and reckless crime\" and those responsible would face a \"robust\" response. Police said government scientists had identified the nerve agent used, but would not make that information public at this stage. The source familiar with the investigation told the BBC it was likely to be rarer than the Sarin gas thought to have been used in Syria and in an attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995. And it was said not to be VX - the nerve agent used to kill the half brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Malaysia last year. Col Skripal, 66, was convicted of passing secrets to MI6 but was given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a \"spy swap\". It is known that he and his 33-year-old daughter had visited the Bishop's Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found collapsed on a bench near the Maltings shopping centre. A witness, who saw the pair at the restaurant, told the BBC Mr Skripal was acting \"very strange\" and was \"very agitated\". \"He seemed to lose his temper... and he just started screaming at the top of his voice, he wanted his bill and he wanted to go.\" Police have yet to say if they know how and where the poison was administered. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said Russia was becoming an \"ever greater threat\", amid speculation the attack could have some element of state involvement. \"Russia's being assertive, Russia's being more aggressive, and we have to change the way that we deal with it because we can't be in a situation in these areas of conflict where we are being pushed around by another nation,\" he told ITV's Good Morning Britain. Police said they wanted to speak to anyone who was in the centre of Salisbury on Sunday afternoon. They are particularly keen to hear from people who ate at Zizzi or drank in the Mill pub between 13:00 and 16:00 GMT. Both sites remain closed to the public. There is also a cordon in place outside Mr Skripal's Salisbury home and part of a business park in nearby Amesbury. Speaking on Wednesday, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said: \"This is being treated as a major incident involving attempted murder, by administration of a nerve agent. He said Col Skripal and his daughter were \"targeted specifically\". \"Our role now of course is to establish who is behind this and why they carried out this act,\" he added. Nerve agents are highly toxic chemicals that stop the nervous system working and shut down bodily functions. They normally enter the body through the mouth or nose, but can also be absorbed through the eyes or skin. Mr Rowley said there was no evidence of a widespread health risk to the public. 'State responsibility'\nHundreds of detectives, forensic officers, analysts and intelligence officers are working on the case, which has drawn comparison with the killing of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko with radioactive polonium-210 in London in 2006. A public inquiry concluded his death was probably carried out with the approval of President Vladimir Putin. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs on Tuesday the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the Skripal case. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, but is open to co-operating with British police if requested. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said foreign media had used the case as part of an anti-Russian campaign. Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal is a retired Russian military intelligence officer who was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Col Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years. Do you have any information to share on this story?

        "content": "Police say a nerve agent was used in an attempt to murder the Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury, Wiltshire. The pair are critically ill, along with a police officer who was among the first to attend the scene. But what are nerve agents and what do they do? What are nerve agents?\nThey are highly toxic chemicals that prevent the nervous system from working properly, and can be fatal. They take different forms - including powder and gas - but they tend to be a liquid, which can seep through the skin. \"Nerve agents are possibly some of the most dangerous things that humans have ever made, after the atom bomb,\" says Dr David Caldicott, clinical senior lecturer at the faculty of medicine at Australian National University. What are the different types?\nThere are five types of nerve agent: The first three agents are clear, colourless, tasteless liquids. VX is the most deadly - a drop on the skin can kill a person within minutes. What was used in this case?\nPolice have not confirmed what agent was used, but a source has told the BBC it was likely to be rarer than sarin or VX nerve agents - two of the best known. When have they been used in the past?\nThe half-brother of North Korean President Kim Jong-un was killed by a nerve agent in an attack in Malaysia last year. Kim Jong-nam died after two women smeared his face with VX nerve agent in 2017 at Kuala Lumpur airport. The UN says the nerve agent sarin has been used by the Syrian government - in an attack on Ghouta, near Damascus, in 2013 and again in Khan Sheikhoun in the north-west of the country in April 2017, killing hundreds. In an attack on Tokyo's subway system in 1995, which killed 13 people, liquid sarin was placed in plastic bags that were pierced by umbrellas with sharpened tips. When Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned in London in 2006, a radioactive substance called polonium 210 was used in a cup of tea. What do they do to the body?\nNerve agents block the messages from the nerves to the muscles. This causes a collapse of many bodily functions. They will act within seconds or minutes if inhaled and slightly slower if exposure is the result of skin contamination. Symptoms include white eyes, as the pupils become constricted, convulsions, drooling and in the worse cases - coma, respiratory failure and death. If you have ever sprayed insect repellent at a fly, you might have seen it drop to the ground and lie on its back, legs twitching. This is the result of nerve agents taking hold. How are they delivered?\nThe nerve agent needs to be ingested, inhaled or to penetrate through the skin, so it usually requires the person delivering it to get very close to the people they are targeting. Only tiny amounts are required for it to take effect. It is so toxic that it would usually be transported in something tightly sealed and those who apply it will need protective clothing. Dr Andrea Sella, professor of inorganic chemistry at University College London, said because of the extreme toxicity of the nerve agents it would be \"very dangerous\" to the person who delivered the poisoning. Is there a risk to the public?\nDespite their extreme toxicity, Dr Sella said the agent posed \"very little risk\" to the public. You would need to be very close to these chemicals to be affected by them. They would also decompose relatively swiftly in damp conditions, Dr Sella said. Dr Hilary Walker, a former radiation scientist and health emergency planner, said there were \"well-rehearsed\" emergency procedures to prevent contamination by these chemicals. These included the hosing down of streets that took place in the immediate aftermath of the incident in Salisbury. What is the treatment?\nThere are antidotes to help reverse the effect of nerve agents, which the emergency services hold. But the sooner the treatment is delivered the better the chance of recovery. Knowing the exact substance enables more targeted treatment. Alastair Hay, emeritus professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds, said the people affected may well have been treated with atropine, which is one of the chemicals you use to treat individuals with this type of poisoning. \"The problem occurs if the treatment is not provided quickly, there is paralysis of the nerves and the muscles, and that inhibits breathing and leads to some damage in the brain. At this stage we don't know if that is a problem. \"Many people appear to recover without too many long-term problems but we won't know until we know the severity of their symptoms.\" Where are they made?\nNerve agents are not materials that can be made at home. Their level of toxicity is such that they are only to be manufactured in specialised facilities, such as a university or industrial laboratory. Discovered by accident in the 1930s by scientists trying to find a cost-effective pesticide, they proved to be highly toxic chemicals that eventually ended up in the hands of the German military. Russia, the US and the UK also started to experiment on chemical agents after World Was Two. Some experts say it is likely the nerve agent used has come from a state. But Dr Simon Cotton, a senior lecturer in chemistry at the University of Birmingham, said it could also have been made by a group with access to the right facilities. \"It could be a state making it but it doesn't have to be. People shouldn't jump to conclusions.\" How do you find where it came from?\nThe authorities would be looking for the container used to deliver the material, as the chemical contents would be a \"goldmine\", Dr Sella said. \"With this information it might well be possible to trace the origin of the substance, just as has been done for the Khan Sheikhoun attack in Syria.\" Chemical weapons expert Hamish de Bretton-Gordon said each country made chemical weapons \"slightly differently\" which might help scientists determine where this attack had come from. \"There is a footprint, there are markers,\" he said.

        "content": "Owners of Oculus Rift headsets could not use their devices for almost a day due to an administrative oversight. Oculus failed to renew a security certificate for some software, meaning headsets would not run key code. Security certificates are often used to authenticate software, and many computers refuse to run code lacking valid credentials. Oculus issued a software update early on Thursday, which it said would fix the problem. Critical time\nThe issue first came to light via social media when headset owners reported that the Oculus PC application was not working. An error message said that the program could not reach Oculus's runtime service. Soon after these reports started circulating, Oculus took to Twitter to acknowledge the problem. We\u2019re aware of an issue impacting people\u2019s ability to use Rift\u2019s software, and we\u2019re working to fix the problem. Please visit https://t.co/uM54CuqqIn for the latest\u2014thanks for your patience! End of Twitter post by @OculusRift It also posted a message to its support forum, apologising for the inconvenience and asking people to be patient while it worked on a fix. The company was criticised for taking too long to respond to queries and posting too little information about the problem. Many people could not wait for an official fix and traded tips on Reddit and other social-media sites about the best way to get around the problem. One suggested solution involved turning a PC's system clock backwards to make it appear as if the certificate had not expired. However, some reported that this then caused problems with other programs on the same PC. In a later update, Oculus said fixing the problem had proved tricky because the expired certificate meant many people could not download and install the update. Early on Thursday, Oculus found a way round this obstacle and provided a further update that renewed the certificate and got the core application working again. It said it would give a store credit to anyone \"impacted\" by the downtime. The security certificates at the heart of the problem are widely used to guarantee the authenticity of the code in applications. The certificates act like a passport for programs, and many machines refuse to run \"unsigned\" or uncertificated programs. \"Oculus are far from alone in experiencing these difficulties,\" said Craig Stewart, a spokesman for certification company Venafi. \"The average business has around 17,000 undiscovered or forgotten certificates in their environment and occasionally one will be as important as this one.\" Mr Stewart said many companies still managed their certificates manually, which could leave them prey to similar \"reputational crises\".

Between Sunday and Tuesday, the RAC received 218 calls for breakdowns relating to potholes, compared with 104 between February and March. It says the extreme cold weather has caused freezing water to get into cracks on already bad road surfaces. The Department for Transport said it was investing \u00a323bn on roads. Local councils fix a pothole every 19 seconds, according to the Local Government Association. Driving into them can cause broken suspension springs, damaged shock absorbers and distorted wheels. Parts of Wales and Yorkshire are facing fresh snowfall as schools are closed, flights are disrupted and drivers advised not to travel. The RAC said consequences from the cold snap could last for years to come as conditions \"wreak havoc\" on the roads. \"Our roads were already in a poor state of repair before the extreme cold weather hit. \"We fear this spring may see the emergence of almost as many potholes as daffodils.\" Meanwhile, charity Cycling UK has warned potholes pose a high risk of personal injury or in the worst cases death.

        "content": "The two Koreas will not march together at the opening ceremony of the Winter Paralympics in Pyeongchang on Friday, officials in the South have said. The sides had reportedly earlier agreed to do so and no reason has yet been given for the decision. The two nations did march together at the opening of the Winter Olympics at the same venue on 9 February. That had been seen as part of a gradual rapprochement in bilateral ties and the nations later agreed a leaders' summit. The summit is expected to discuss how to reduce tension on the peninsula. \"After discussion with the North, the two Koreas decided not to march together at the opening ceremony,\" the South's Yonhap news agency quoted the South Korean Paralympic Committee (KPC) as saying on Thursday. Yonhap said the KPC would set out the reasons in a statement later. The Pyeongchang Paralympics run until 18 March. The two Koreas had held a landmark diplomatic meeting in the North's capital, Pyongyang, earlier this week. A South Korean delegation is now en route to the US and is expected to pass on a message from the North's leader, Kim Jong-un. China has welcomed the forthcoming talks but warned it was too early to assume they would bring a lasting breakthrough on the central issue - nuclear weapons. ",

        "content": "The Co-operative is being investigated by the supermarket regulator over its treatment of suppliers. The Groceries Code Adjudicator (GCA) said there was \"reasonable suspicion\" the retailer had breached its rules. It will look at the way the Co-op \"de-listed\" suppliers, and charged them when comparing and assessing products for its supermarket shelves. The Co-op accepted it had \"fallen short\" and said it had already taken \"decisive steps\" to improve matters. However, GCA chief Christine Tacon said she had decided to launch a full investigation \"to fully understand the extent to which the code may have been broken and the root causes of the issues as well as their impact on suppliers\". \"In particular, the investigation will consider the extent, scale and impact of practices which may have resulted in suppliers being de-listed with no, or short, fixed notice periods unilaterally imposed by Co-operative Group Limited without due consideration of published GCA de-listing guidance.\" 'Very sorry'\nJo Whitfield, chief executive of Co-op Food, said the company acknowledged it had \"fallen short\" and has been in talks with the GCA for months. The retailer said it had already refunded 110 suppliers a total of about \u00a3500,000 in charges for product assessments - so-called benchmarking. It added it had \"already taken decisive steps in line with our commitment to ensure the fair treatment of all of our suppliers\". These actions include: Ms Whitfield said: \"We care deeply about our relationships with our suppliers and we are very sorry that... we have failed to live up to our usual high standards. \"We are already addressing the issues with the GCA and our suppliers and we hope the investigation will help bring to light any additional cases so that we can put these right as quickly as possible.\" The GCA, which was set up to ensure that the 10 large supermarket groups treat their direct suppliers lawfully and fairly, has the power to fine retailers up to 1% of annual turnover. In 2016, the ombudsman found that Tesco \"knowingly delayed paying money to suppliers in order to improve its own financial position\". However, back then the GCA had no powers to fine supermarkets, only to make recommendations. The GCA, an independent regulator which reports to the Department for Business and Energy and Industrial Strategy, wants suppliers and related parties to provide any evidence by 3 May. ",

The father, mother and daughter, 17, all of them Austrian citizens, are in hospital after the attack near Prater Park on Wednesday evening. The attacker fled and the motive and details are unclear. A Chechen man, 20, was also injured after being stabbed near the scene later. Police arrested an Afghan national in relation to that attack but say it is unclear if he was involved in the first incident, which occurred on the city's Praterstrasse shopping street. He was searched by officers who found he had two knives, the Kleine Zeitung newspaper reports. \"At the moment, what we know for certain is that there was a knife attack at roughly 19:45 [18:45 GMT],\" police spokesman Patrick Maierhofer said. \"According to witnesses a man attacked three people. All three were seriously injured and are in a life-threatening condition. \"Half an hour later, there was another attack and here a person was also seriously injured and their life is in danger. \"We do not know to what extent there is a connection here and any motive remains unclear.\" Both attacks occurred in Vienna's Second District which houses much of the city's Jewish community. The area includes the well-known Prater Park as well as the Praterstern transport hub. ",

        "content": "Architect Balkrishna Doshi, known for his pioneering work in low-cost housing, has won this year's prestigious Pritzker Prize. Doshi, 90, is the first Indian to win the award, which is regarded as the highest honour in the field. \"Balkrishna Doshi has always created an architecture that is serious, never flashy or a follower of trends,\" said the Pritzker jury. Over a career spanning six decades, Doshi became one of the most influential architects of post-independence India, fusing international modernist principles with local traditions. The jury added that Doshi \"constantly demonstrates that all good architecture and urban planning must not only unite purpose and structure but must take into account climate, site, technique, and craft, along with a deep understanding and appreciation of the context in the broadest sense\". Doshi thanked the jury and said in a statement that his works \"are an extension of my life, philosophy and dreams trying to create treasury of the architectural spirit\". \"Every object around us, and nature itself - lights, sky, water and storm - everything is in a symphony.\" Speaking to BBC Gujarati, Doshi described how he views architecture as a medium. \"When we wear clothes, we make sure they are comfortable. But fashion design is different from this. Similarly, what is appropriate for culture, space and the way people live is comfort. \"They feel happy, and this is when people celebrate their living. That is architecture, in my opinion.\" Doshi studied in Mumbai, before travelling to Paris in the 1950s to work for the Franco-Swiss pioneer and iconic 20th century Modernist, Le Corbusier. He stands out for his wide-ranging work in buildings, which include academic institutions, mixed-use complexes, housing projects, public spaces, galleries and private residences. Referring to his childhood, Doshi told the BBC that he had been inspired by the multi-storey structures around him. \"I used to see two- and three-storey buildings and how generations of a family would grow within them. People still live inside such buildings, and the certain charm and warmth of it, is what shaped my understanding of how homes should be.\" One of his favourite housing projects is one that he designed for Life Insurance Corporation in the western city of Ahmedabad. \"Here I knew that the houses would be occupied by several generations of the same family, that they would identify with it, that there will be a strong sense of belonging and that their needs will change, and that they may modify parts of it,\" Doshi said in a press release. Known for reimagining low-cost housing, his design of one such scheme in the central city of Indore has more than 6,500 homes for some 80,000 low to middle income people. A system of houses, courtyards and a labyrinth of internal pathways make it one of the most notable low-cost housing schemes in India. \"It seems I should take an oath and remember it for my lifetime: to provide the lowest class with the proper dwelling,\" Doshi said in 1954. Doshi began studying architecture in 1947, the year India gained independence, at Mumbai's famous Sir JJ School of Architecture. And many of his notable works also include structures of institutions, like a top management school in the southern city of Bangalore. In an interview with CNN, Doshi said that by winning this award, he hopes to draw attention to the infrastructure of social housing in India. \"These people have nothing - no land, no place, no employment,\" he said. \"But if the government gives them a little piece of land, they can get a feeling of, 'I'm going to work hard, and find a way to build my own home.' If you put them together as a community, there's cooperation, there's sharing, there's understanding and there's this whole diffusion of religion, caste, custom and occupation.\" He will be awarded $100,000 (\u00a380,591) at a ceremony in Toronto in May. Previous winners of the coveted prize include J\u00f8rn Utzon who designed the Sydney Opera House, Oscar Niemeyer of Brazil and the British-Iraqi designer, Zaha Hadid. Photos courtesy of VSF, AFP ",

        "content": "Suspected domestic abusers could be electronically tagged under government proposals for England and Wales. The draft Domestic Abuse Bill will also propose tougher sentences where children are involved and more support for victims who testify in court. There is a new definition of economic abuse - if people are denied access to jobs or money, or forced to take loans. Prime Minister Theresa May said the bill could \"completely transform the way we tackle domestic abuse\". Proposed Domestic Abuse Protection Orders (DAPOs) would allow police and courts to intervene earlier where abuse is suspected. The orders would allow courts to electronically monitor suspects' whereabouts before they have been found guilty of - or even committed - a crime. DAPOs would bring together elements from existing protective orders, while giving courts the power to set a wider range of restrictions and for longer periods than the current 28 days. Other measures being considered include: It is estimated that almost two million adults in England and Wales have been victims of domestic abuse in the past year while 95 women and men were killed by current or former partners in 2016-17. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said: \"It is appalling that in 21st-Century Britain, nearly two million people every year - the majority of them women - suffer abuse at the hands of those closest to them.\" Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme Ms Rudd said the new definition of economic abuse would help prosecute perpetrators of domestic violence, who raid their victims' bank accounts or force them to take out loans. She added that judges prescribing \"early intervention initiatives\" such as alcohol treatment programmes for abusers could stop \"behaviour early on\". On International Women's Day she said: \"If we want to be really ambitious about equality, ambitious about protecting women, this is exactly the sort of change we need to take head on.\" Euleen Hope suffered a decade of physical and emotional abuse from her partner for more than a decade. She said she required hospital treatment more than a dozen times and would grow her fringe to cover the black eyes. \"He already said to me he'll say when it's over, and then he told me he'd organise to have someone throw acid in my face [if I left].\" Her former partner was eventually jailed in 2015 for GBH and assault after her sister got in contact with the police. Women's Aid chief executive Katie Ghose welcomed \"the spotlight and recognition\" of economic abuse. She said domestic abuse was about \"power and control\" She added: \"It can take all forms, it can be everything from taking charge of someone's wages, restricting their movements, right through to committing benefit fraud in their name.\" 'Radical change'\nMs Ghose said financial control can sometimes be a precursor to physical and sexual violence. But she cautioned the \"ambition will be undermined if there is not a long-term, sustainable funding plan for refuges in place\". Suzanne Jacob, chief executive of domestic abuse charity SafeLives, said: \"We welcome the focus on the urgent need to hold perpetrators to account and to prioritise the needs and safety of women and girls. \"The time for piecemeal sticking plasters is over, we need radical change.\" The consultation period for the draft bill will run until 31 May.

        "content": "The attempted murder of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, using a nerve agent was a \"brazen and reckless attack\", Amber Rudd has said. Both Col Skripal and his daughter are still critically ill after being found collapsed on a bench in Salisbury city centre on Sunday. Counter-terrorism officers are working to find the origin of the nerve agent. A police officer, who was in intensive care, is now \"stable and conscious\", Wiltshire's chief constable said. Addressing the House of Commons, Ms Rudd said the attack was \"attempted murder in the most cruel and public way\". The home secretary told MPs it was an \"outrageous crime\", adding that the government would \"act without hesitation as the facts become clearer\". Earlier, she said the nerve agent used was \"very rare\" and denied the UK's response was soft. It comes amid speculation the Russian state may have been involved in the attack, which it denies. A Downing Street spokesman described it as an \"appalling and reckless crime\" and said those responsible would face a \"robust\" response. Police said government scientists had identified the nerve agent used, but would not make that information public at this stage. The source familiar with the investigation told the BBC it was likely to be rarer than the Sarin gas thought to have been used in Syria and in an attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995. And it was said not to be VX - the nerve agent used to kill the half brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Malaysia last year. Analysis\nBy Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent The fact the nerve agent is \"very rare\" will help the investigation narrow its focus. Making nerve agents and delivering them requires considerable infrastructure and the more unusual the agent the easier it will be to locate which country, even which laboratory, might be involved. That combined with police leads on who delivered the agent will form the basis for a determination of responsibility, along with any other intelligence that can be gathered. It may take days - even weeks - for the government to be confident enough to make a public statement, becuase it will not want to risk getting any details wrong. But if suspicions about Russia are confirmed, then some kind of action seems inevitable. The legacy of the 2006 Litvinenko case shows that expelling diplomats alone may not be regarded as much of a deterrent to future acts. Economic sanctions on the Russian elite may have more bite, but would require greater political will. Col Skripal, 66, was convicted of passing secrets to MI6 but was given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a \"spy swap\". It is known that he and his 33-year-old daughter had visited the Bishop's Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found collapsed on a bench near the Maltings shopping centre. A witness, who saw the pair at the restaurant, told the BBC Mr Skripal was acting \"very strange\" and was \"very agitated\". \"He seemed to lose his temper... and he just started screaming at the top of his voice, he wanted his bill and he wanted to go.\" Police have yet to say if they know how and where the poison was administered. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said Russia was becoming an \"ever greater threat\", amid speculation the attack could have some element of state involvement. \"Russia's being assertive, Russia's being more aggressive, and we have to change the way that we deal with it because we can't be in a situation in these areas of conflict where we are being pushed around by another nation,\" he told ITV's Good Morning Britain. Police said they wanted to speak to anyone who was in the centre of Salisbury on Sunday afternoon. They are particularly keen to hear from people who ate at Zizzi or drank in the Mill pub between 13:00 and 16:00 GMT. Both sites remain closed to the public. There is also a cordon in place outside Mr Skripal's Salisbury home and part of a business park in nearby Amesbury. Speaking on Wednesday, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said: \"This is being treated as a major incident involving attempted murder, by administration of a nerve agent. He said Col Skripal and his daughter were \"targeted specifically\". \"Our role now of course is to establish who is behind this and why they carried out this act,\" he added. Nerve agents are highly toxic chemicals that stop the nervous system working and shut down bodily functions. They normally enter the body through the mouth or nose, but can also be absorbed through the eyes or skin. Mr Rowley said there was no evidence of a widespread health risk to the public. Hundreds of detectives, forensic officers, analysts and intelligence officers are working on the case, which has drawn comparison with the killing of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko with radioactive polonium-210 in London in 2006. A public inquiry concluded his death was probably carried out with the approval of President Vladimir Putin. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs on Tuesday the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the Skripal case. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, but is open to co-operating with British police if requested. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said foreign media had used the case as part of an anti-Russian campaign. Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal is a retired Russian military intelligence officer who was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Col Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years. Do you have any information to share on this story?

They are particularly keen to hear from people who ate at Zizzi or drank in the Mill pub between 13:00 and 16:00 GMT. Both sites remain closed to the public. There is also a cordon in place outside Mr Skripal's Salisbury home and part of a business park in nearby Amesbury. Speaking on Wednesday, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said: \"This is being treated as a major incident involving attempted murder, by administration of a nerve agent. He said Col Skripal and his daughter were \"targeted specifically\". \"Our role now of course is to establish who is behind this and why they carried out this act,\" he added. Nerve agents are highly toxic chemicals that stop the nervous system working and shut down bodily functions. They normally enter the body through the mouth or nose, but can also be absorbed through the eyes or skin. Mr Rowley said there was no evidence of a widespread health risk to the public. Hundreds of detectives, forensic officers, analysts and intelligence officers are working on the case, which has drawn comparison with the killing of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko with radioactive polonium-210 in London in 2006. A public inquiry concluded his death was probably carried out with the approval of President Vladimir Putin. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs on Tuesday the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the Skripal case. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, but is open to co-operating with British police if requested. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said foreign media had used the case as part of an anti-Russian campaign. Who is Sergei Skripal?\nColonel Skripal is a retired Russian military intelligence officer who was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Col Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years. Do you have any information to share on this story?

        "content": "Shares in Countrywide, the UK's largest estate agent group, lost 20% after it warned of tough times in the market. Countrywide, whose brands include Bairstow Eves and Gascoigne Pees, made a \u00a3208.1m after-tax loss in 2017, versus a \u00a317.5m profit in 2016. said about 150 head office jobs would go. The firm has been hit by a slowdown in the housing market as well as the rise of online agents such as Purplebricks. Shares pulled back half the loss to be down 10% in midday trading. The profit figures were also dragged lower by one-off costs as Countrywide continued to restructure the business. But even with these are stripped out, pre-tax profits more than halved to \u00a325.2m, from \u00a352.7m in 2016. Countrywide, which called 2017 \"a disappointing year\", said trading had remained under pressure since the start of 2018 with a pipeline of work \"significantly\" below a year earlier. Cost-cutting drive\nIts previous chief executive, Alison Platt, left last month after a profit warning and announcement of a further restructuring of the business which included investment in digital operations to compete with online rivals. Countrywide said on Thursday that it was shedding about 150 of its 450-strong head office team as part of a cost-cutting drive. The firm employs about 8,000 nationwide. The results announcement laid bare the problems in its core sales and lettings arm, where earnings sank 47% to \u00a314.9m. Across sales and lettings in London, earnings fell 44% to \u00a311.5m. Executive chairman Peter Long admitted that the patience of investors had been \"sorely tested\". The company will not be paying a dividend to shareholders. He said the group was working to resolve poor performance in sales and lettings, but admitted it would \"take time\". \"We believe these business units are fixable, know what we have to do to restore them and the steps to take that should result in a return to profitable growth.\" Some of the problems facing the housing sector were underlined on Thursday with news that the number of homes on estate agents' books had dwindled to a new low. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said average property stock levels per branch on agents' books fell to a new record low of just under 42, as inquiries from new buyers, new instructions from sellers and newly-agreed sales continued to drift lower in February. New buyer inquiries fell for the 11th month in a row, while sales trends have remained similar over the past six months, Rics said. Where can you afford to live?

        "content": "The two Koreas will not march together at the opening ceremony of the Winter Paralympics in Pyeongchang on Friday, officials in the South have said. The sides had reportedly earlier agreed to do so and no reason has yet been given for the decision. The two nations did march together at the opening of the Winter Olympics at the same venue on 9 February. That had been seen as part of a gradual rapprochement in bilateral ties and the nations later agreed a leaders' summit. The summit is expected to discuss how to reduce tension on the peninsula. \"After discussion with the North, the two Koreas decided not to march together at the opening ceremony,\" the South's Yonhap news agency quoted the South Korean Paralympic Committee (KPC) as saying on Thursday. Yonhap said the KPC would set out the reasons in a statement later. The apparent rapprochement over the Winter Olympics had seen the selection of a joint women's ice hockey team, the deployment of a squad of North Korean cheerleaders and most significantly a high-level Northern delegation that included Kim Yo-jong - the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The charm offensive was hailed by some as a breakthrough in relations but conservatives in the South issued warnings and the US was unmoved in its tough diplomatic stance. Message to the US\nIn the wake of the Games, the two Koreas held a landmark diplomatic meeting in the North's capital, Pyongyang, earlier this week. A South Korean delegation is now en route to the US and is expected to pass on a message from the North's leader, Kim Jong-un. The US, which only this week increased its sanctions on Pyongyang over the death in Malaysia of Mr Kim's brother, Kim Jong-nam, has said it is open to talking to North Korea but only if it commits to denuclearisation. China has welcomed the forthcoming talks but warned it was too early to assume they would bring a lasting breakthrough on the central nuclear issue. The past year has seen a rising war of words between the US and North Korea, with the North test-firing increasingly powerful missiles. The last time major international talks were held to persuade North Korea to disarm were the Six-Party Talks involving North and South Korea, the US, China Japan, and Russia. North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear and weapons programme in exchange for aid and reduced sanctions. But the talks broke down in 2008 after failing to agree on how to verify the North's commitments, and in 2009 North Korea conducted its second nuclear weapons test. ",

        "content": "Bonuses for 84,000 staff at John Lewis and Waitrose have been cut for the fifth year in a row. Employees will get a 5% bonus, down from 6% last year and the lowest since the 4% paid out in 1954. Annual group profit, before the partnership bonus, tax and exceptional items, fell 21.9% to \u00a3289.2m. John Lewis Partnership chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield said 2017 had been a \"challenging year\", as expected, with \"subdued\" consumer demand. He said weakness in sterling had led to higher costs, putting pressure on the business's profit margin. The partnership said it had been hit by exceptional costs of \u00a3282.5m, including \u00a3111.3m to cover the restructuring of branch, distribution and retail operations. \"This was why we chose to reduce the proportion of profits paid as partnership bonus last year so as to absorb these impacts while continuing to invest in the future and in strengthening our balance sheet,\" Sir Charlie said. He said the firm remained committed to increasing pay rates for non-management staff, and that the average hourly rate of pay for a non-management workers was \u00a38.91. 'Volatile' year ahead\nLike-for-like sales - which strip out the impact of store openings - at the John Lewis department stores were up 0.4%. At Waitrose, sales returned to growth, with like-for-like sales rising 0.9%. Gross sales for the full-year period were up 2% at \u00a311.6bn. \"We expect trading to be volatile in 2018-19, with continuing economic uncertainty and no let up in competitive intensity. We therefore anticipate further pressure on profits,\" the company said. Redundancy payments cost it \u00a372.8m in 2017. The partnership said 1,440 members of staff had left the business through redundancy in the past year. Analysis: Emma Simpson, BBC business correspondent\nJohn Lewis is owned by its staff and they cherish their annual bonus. It's down for the fifth year in a row but given the challenging conditions on the High Street right now, some partners may be feeling grateful for any extra payout. John Lewis continues to be one of the stronger players. Today's figures show even this household name isn't immune from the forces buffeting the industry. It warned back in January 2017 that it would reduce the bonus in order to prepare for tougher trading conditions ahead. That looks to have been a prudent move. But the relentless pressure on profits shows no sign of easing this year, either. 'Tricky conditions'\nThe company said that its John Lewis stores had increased market share in fashion, homewares, electrical goods and home technology, with sales in the latter category up by 2.6%. Fashion sales climbed 3.2%, boosted by a strong performance in womenswear, up 5.0%. Sales of its own-brand womenswear rose 14.9%. But homeware sales were down 0.8%, with soft demand in categories such as fitted furniture, fitted flooring and upholstery. \"These results show that conditions of the High Street are very tricky at the moment,\" said Richard Lim, chief executive of analysts Retail Economics. \"Consumer spending generally is a lot softer, while inflation is still near a five-year high.\" He said research by his firm showed that consumers were also worried about Brexit and their own low levels of personal savings. \"People's personal finances are under pressure.\" Mr Lim said that in the year ahead John Lewis would be looking very closely at its costs and at ways of potentially bringing these down. \"That could mean looking at using their existing spaces more efficiently and innovatively.\" How does the John Lewis Partnership work?\n",

It is believed that Amelia Wood was walking alongside a road in Manby, Lincolnshire, on Tuesday morning when a wheel fell off a Land Rover Discovery.

Lincolnshire Police asked for anyone who saw the white vehicle travelling on the B1200 Manby Road towards Saltfleetby to get in contact.

Rufaro Chisango tweeted the video of the abuse which included \"we hate blacks\" while locked in her room at Nottingham Trent University (NTU) halls of residence on Wednesday. NTU has suspended the \"suspected perpetrators\" pending inquiries. Two 18-year-old men have been arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated public order offences. Miss Chisango, who filmed the chanting on Monday evening, tweeted: \"yoo I'm fuming, the way people in the same uni halls as me are chanting 'we hate the blacks' outside my bedroom door. \"Words cannot describe how sad this makes me feel, in this 2018 people think this is still acceptable.\" She told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she \"felt really shocked, isolated and uncomfortable\" when she heard the \"shouting outside my door\". \"It was a big impact obviously, when it happened. It shouldn't be tolerated at all.\" Miss Chisango had reported the abuse to the university halls of residence reception on Tuesday, but the NTU was only informed on Wednesday. She said: \"It shouldn't have [taken] such a long delay when I reported something like this. \"I just want the appropriate action to be taken.\" 'Common experiences'\nNTU said it was \"shocked and appalled\" to see the video and was investigating \"as a matter of urgency\". \"We are also working with our accommodation partner to understand why the university was only alerted to this on Wednesday evening after this was reported to them in the very early hours of Tuesday.

        "content": "US President Donald Trump obtained a restraining order against an adult film actress to prevent her from speaking publicly about their alleged affair, legal documents show. Mr Trump's personal lawyer obtained the order against Stormy Daniels in private arbitration proceedings last month. It bars her from sharing \"confidential information\" about their alleged relationship, US media report. Mr Trump says allegations against him are all false. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters on Wednesday that the president had won arbitration proceedings against the actress, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. \"This case has already been won in arbitration and anything beyond that, I would refer you to the president's outside counsel,\" she said. But the attorney representing Ms Clifford told CBS News that he was \"dumbfounded\" by the White House's comment. \"For the White House spokesperson to stand up and claim that Trump won the case in arbitration is ludicrous,\" Michael Avenatti said. \"How do you win something when the other side is not even invited?\" he said. Mr Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, emailed the restraining order to Ms Clifford's legal team on 28 February, according to NBC News. \"The document itself is to remain confidential and not to be disclosed to anyone as per the terms of the judge's order,\" the email said. Details of the restraining order have emerged a day after Ms Clifford filed a lawsuit against Mr Trump, alleging that a non-disclosure contract she signed was invalid. She said the agreement, drawn up before the 2016 election, was \"void\" because he had not signed it. The civil lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles on Tuesday, says that only days before the election, Ms Clifford and Mr Cohen signed a \"hush agreement\" but Mr Trump did not, \"thus rendering it legally null and void and of no consequence\". It also refers to last month's \"bogus arbitration proceeding\" where the restraining order was obtained by Mr Cohen. The order, issued on 27 February, bars Ms Clifford from sharing any information related to the non-disclosure agreement. Mr Cohen confirmed last month that he had privately paid Ms Clifford $130,000 (\u00a395,000) but did not say what it was for. He said neither Mr Trump nor the Trump Organization was a party to this transaction. ",

        "content": "When the draw for the last 16 of the Europa League was made, AC Milan sporting director and former Sunderland scout Massimiliano Mirabelli said: \"I feel sorry for Arsenal.\" His tongue was firmly in cheek but the display of the braggadocio - of the sort you used to associate with this club on big European nights - offered a strong indication of how confident the mood is around Milan at the moment. In many respects, that's exactly how it should be. Milan spent 220m euros (\u00a3201.5m) last summer, buying an entire new team for the price of one Neymar, in an effort to lift this fallen giant back to its feet. The papers in Italy hyped Milan up as title contenders and installed them among the favourites for the Europa League. By the end of 2017, though, it looked like it had all gone up in smoke. Vincenzo Montella was sacked in late November. Champions League qualification, essential to mysterious new owner Li Yonghong's development scheme, seemed beyond Milan. Meanwhile investigations by the New York Times and Corriere della Sera raised serious questions about the structuring of the takeover, the sustainability of the project and whether Li is as wealthy as he claims to be. Milan are currently subject to \"monitoring\" by Uefa over Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations, given their outlay on players and their outstanding debts. In December, the governing body, unconvinced by the club's business plan, rejected their application for a voluntary agreement and are currently deliberating which FFP sanctions to impose next season. Given this backdrop, then, why is Mirabelli so bullish? Enter Gennaro 'Rino' Gattuso. As a kid growing up on the Calabrian coast, Gattuso used to dream about becoming a fisherman. Before footballers, he idolised the local trawlermen. He'd help them unload their nets as they returned to port and was rewarded with some shellfish to sell on the streets of Schiavonea, his hometown on Italy's Ionian coast. Flash forward to late November and you might say Gattuso landed the biggest fish of his career: the top job at the club for which he had been a legendary player. Promoted from his role with the under-19s, many thought he was out of his depth and that Milan were merely repeating the kind of mistakes made towards the end of Silvio Berlusconi's time as owner: appointing former fan favourites with little or no managerial experience. Before Gattuso there had been Clarence Seedorf, Filippo Inzaghi and Cristian Brocchi, all of them former team-mates of Gattuso. Gattuso's coaching CV didn't exactly inspire confidence. Aside from taking Pisa up to the second division, this new chapter of his career was best known for a news conference he gave at OFI Crete in which he went on a fantastic rant in broken English, complete with Greek expletives. In truth, however, it was hard to judge him as a manager. At Palermo and Swiss side Sion, where he started his managerial career in 2013, he worked under owners who would sack Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho depending on which side of the bed they woke up on. Meanwhile, Pisa and OFI Crete both went bust. Times were so tough during his time at the former that when the players ripped his 150 euro shirt while celebrating promotion, he joked: \"I can hardly ask them to pay me back, given the situation.\" Framed by the media as a caretaker manager when Milan announced his appointment in the winter, the expectation was that Gattuso would keep the bench warm while the board made overtures to Chelsea boss Antonio Conte about returning to Italy at the end of the season. But Mirabelli dismissed such talk out of hand. \"Gattuso is not a caretaker,\" he insisted. Three months later it's apparent Mirabelli was not paying lip service to his fellow Calabrian. Against the odds, Gattuso has shown he belongs at this level, proving the doubters wrong, just as he did as a player. AC Milan under Gattuso\nThe signs weren't promising at first. In Gattuso's first game in charge in December, Milan became the first team to drop points to Benevento, the worst team in Serie A history, conceding a stoppage-time equaliser to their goalkeeper Alberto Brignoli. Then they were thrashed 3-0 by relegation-threatened Hellas Verona and embarrassed by Croatian side Rijeka in the Europa League. The club cancelled its Christmas party and the players were made to live at the training ground until they sorted things out. If Milan did not come through a cup tie against Inter on 27 December, there was talk of Gattuso going the same way as Seedorf, Inzaghi and Brocchi. To him it was \"a World Cup final\" and Milan played as if their lives depended on it, knocking their 'cousins' out in extra time. Since then they haven't looked back. Milan are on an extraordinary run. Unbeaten in 13 games in all competitions, they have started beating the teams above them, winning six straight games and booking their place in the Coppa Italia final. Reaching the Champions League, either by finishing fourth or winning the Europa League, remains a long shot but belief is growing as momentum gathers. Gattuso has approached the job with the same humility he showed as a player. He had to sweat to get to the top and work even harder to stay there, and his honesty has always been pretty amusing. \"When I watch Pirlo play I ask myself whether I can truly be considered a footballer,\" he said once. And yet Gattuso - who also likes to remind people that \"I was still playing on the beach at 13, can't take a free-kick or set up a goal\" - still managed to win everything. He overcame his limitations. As a coach, Gattuso is simply getting Milan to meet expectation. He works his team hard. He playfully calls 21-year-old Davide Calabria a 40-year-old because the full-back is always asking for a break in training as if he's too old for this. But the players love it. They're fitter and stronger than under Montella and it shows. Far from reinventing the wheel, Gattuso has merely applied common sense. He asked himself: if 4-3-3 worked for Milan last year, why can't it this year? And how about lining players up in their natural positions? That ought to do the trick. \"I'm not a great coach,\" Gattuso protests. \"I've gained a lot of experience and still have a lot to learn. Lately people are talking too much. It's as if I've become some guru of coaching\u2026 I'm not.\" The little things he has done add up to a lot, however: settling on a back four; promoting Calabria from the youth team; tightening a defence that now looks every bit the future of the national team with Gigio Donnarumma, Alessio Romagnoli and Leonardo Bonucci keeping a clean sheet for almost 10 hours. It doesn't end there. He has got Milan's big-money signings Lucas Biglia, Hakan Calhanoglu and Bonucci to play to their potential. He has balanced Milan's attack to make them less right-sided, less dependent on Suso, and more unpredictable. He has turned a group of strangers into a team that fights for one another. And all with the charisma of cuddly bulldog. Milan were excellent against Sampdoria and Roma before tragic circumstances saw last weekend's games called off. The side waiting for Arsenal at the San Siro, where enthusiasm is high, are in form and rested. \"I'm not Padre Pio,\" Gattuso said at his unveiling, referencing a Catholic saint. But if he gets Milan into the Champions League he will have worked a minor miracle considering his starting position. Milan are 'rinati' under Rino. Reborn. ",

        "content": "Thousands of patients in England have been left in \"pain and discomfort\" because of the decision to postpone operations, surgeons say. The Royal College of Surgeons said those waiting for hip and knee surgery had been the worst affected. Operations were put off this winter to free up beds for A&Es. And new figures show 40,000 fewer were performed this winter than during the previous one. Accident and emergency waits have hit their worst level for over a decade. During the winter, just over 85% of A&E patients have been treated or admitted within four hours, well below the 95% target. This is the worst performance since the target was introduced in 2004.  Can't find your health trust? Browse the full list Rather search by typing? Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker, click or tap here. Royal College of Surgeons president Prof Derek Alderson acknowledged delaying operations was a \"necessary evil\" given the pressure A&Es were under. But he said: \"It also inevitably prevented many patients who are in discomfort or pain from having an operation when they needed it, potentially causing their condition to deteriorate.\" As well as hip and knee surgery, the college said patients waiting for brain surgery for benign tumours that can cause sight problems if left and those needing treatment for conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and Crohn's disease would also have been affected. \"We urgently need a clear plan to deal with the growing backlog of cancelled operations,\" Prof Alderson said. Waiting for an op 'stops everything'\nOne of those caught up in the delays is teacher Scott Randolph. He has been waiting for spinal surgery since November. He says his degenerative condition has left him in \"excruciating pain\" at times. It has affected his ability to work and spend time with his two young children. \"I can't go out to play football with my son and I can't go horse-riding with my daughter. \"It stops everything.\" Beds have been freed up - NHS bosses\nThe data published on Thursday by NHS England showed there were 544,000 operations carried out in December and January, down from 585,500 over the same period the year before. It came after NHS bosses ordered hospitals ahead of Christmas to put off routine treatments amid signs A&Es were struggling. NHS England defended the move to delay operations, saying it had helped free up 1,400 beds - the equivalent of two to three hospitals - over the winter months. But Dr Chaand Nagpaul, who chairs the British Medical Association, warned the pressures were \"far from over\". \"Patients are continuing to be routinely failed.\" Pressures are also being felt elsewhere in the UK. Waiting lists for hospital operations have risen in Scotland and Northern Ireland. And while they remain stable in Wales, the target to see patients within 26 weeks is still being missed.

        "content": "A video showing the moment an orange fireball engulfed a Tube train has been shown to jurors at the Old Bailey. A bomb exploded on the District Line on 15 September, 2017, and prosecutors allege that Ahmed Hassan built the device and set the timer. The footage showed commuters cowering from flames and fleeing on to the platform. Mr Hassan denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. CCTV allegedly shows him leaving the train one stop earlier at Putney Bridge station, having left a bag behind. Detective Constable Andrew Leonard told the court that Mr Hassan was not seen to put his hand inside the bag at any point. He was arrested at the Port of Dover the next day. 'A bang and screaming'\nMany of the 93 people caught in the bombing suffered burns or were crushed in the stampede to get out, the court heard. Prosecutor Alison Morgan has said experts concluded it was simply \"luck\" that the bomb did not fully detonate. A victim, referred to in court as Miss S, was a metre away from the device when it exploded. She told the jury there was \"a bang [and] people screaming\". She added: \"I had burns, my knees were bad, my face was all burned. My coat was burning, my tights melted.\" Aimee Colville, who got on the train at Parsons Green moments before the explosion, said she saw a \"wall of glass\" coming towards her. She said: \"I don't know if I physically got myself down or if I blacked out, but at that point I noticed a flame come over my right side. \"It came over my side and that is when I smelt the burning.\" She added: \"That morning I had curled my hair and I had put hairspray in my hair, so when the flames came over me my hair immediately caught fire.\" Journey before attack\nA number of other videos allegedly showing Mr Hassan's movements on the day of the attack have been shown to the jury by prosecutors. The first video is said by prosecutors to show him leaving his foster home in Sunbury, Surrey, carrying a plastic bag, which they told the court contained the device that exploded on the underground train. A second then allegedly shows Mr Hassan catching a train to Wimbledon. And CCTV from the platform allegedly showed him going into the station toilets - where prosecutors said he set the timer on the device - and emerging 13 minutes later carrying the bag and heading towards the District Line platforms. Further footage was also shown, which prosecutors said showed Mr Hassan from a day before the attack going to two supermarkets - an Asda and an Aldi in Feltham - buying matches, batteries, a screw driver and screw driver bit sets, allegedly used to construct the device. UK arrival\nJurors were told on Wednesday that Mr Hassan had arrived in Britain in the back of a lorry via the Channel Tunnel in October 2015. He told authorities he was born in June 1999 in Iraq, but had no identity documents. He gave his name as Ahmed Hassan Mohammed Ali. He claimed asylum, and from 2016 lived with foster parents in Cavendish Road, Sunbury. At the time he allegedly planned his attack, his asylum claim was still outstanding, the court heard. The trial continues. ",

        "content": "We are finally getting a look inside the biggest planet in the Solar System - Jupiter. And it is very strange. The American space agency's Juno probe has been studying the variations in the pull of gravity as it flies across the giant world's banded atmosphere. These measurements betray the movement of mass within Jupiter, and that gives scientists clues to its structure. The latest data reveals the activity of those familiar, colourful, wind-sculpted bands extends 3,000km down. That's on a planet which is 140,000km wide. \"This solves a long-time mystery,\" said Juno scientist Tristan Guillot from the Nice Observatory, France. \"For over 40 years we didn't know whether the bands would go all the way to the centre, or whether they were just skin deep. Three thousand km is actually quite deep. It's 1% of the mass of the planet. Jupiter's very big so it's about three Earth masses that are involved in this motion.\" \"This is all really important for understanding atmospheric dynamics, not just on Jupiter but on other gaseous planets like Saturn, Uranus and Neptune and also the exoplanets we're now discovering,\" he told BBC News. Dr Guillot is an author on a slew of papers in the journal Nature describing the latest observations from Juno. In particular, he led the study that examined what may lurk even deeper than the roots of the bands. This is a domain where the predominant gases of hydrogen and helium start to transition under immense pressure into exotic fluid states. And in contrast to the east-west motions that are seen at the surface, the entire interior mass of material appears to rotate in a uniform way - as if a solid body. It is within this body that Jupiter's immense magnetic field is produced. \"It's generated a bit deeper down when hydrogen becomes so highly compressed that it becomes a metal. And then charges can move easily and you can have, with convection, what's called a dynamo effect,\" said Dr Guillot. The jury's still out on whether Jupiter has a rocky core. This determination is one of the key questions Juno was sent to answer. Early investigations suggest it may do, but not in the sense that is easily understandable. It could be quite diffuse; \"diluted\" or \"partially mixed with the interior\", the French scientist says. Clarity should come the longer the mission runs. The US space agency will soon need to approve a funded extension to Juno's stay. Scientists would like a minimum coverage of 34 orbits (one orbit around Jupiter takes 53 days), which would take the mission, which arrived in July 2016, through to 2021. It would permit the researchers to fully map the planet's magnetic field and to pursue other questions such as the precise depth of Jupiter's Great Red Spot. Microwave observations indicate the huge, long-lived storm in the southern hemisphere reaches down at least 350km into the atmosphere. Additional gravity measurements may find it descends further still. Juno so far has been a tour de force, bringing a very difference perspective on Jupiter to those spacecraft that have visited the gas giant in the past. The way that the probe flies around the planet, from pole to pole, means, for example, that it can see storms at high latitudes that simply are not visible from Earth-based telescopes. One of the papers published in Nature this week notes the interesting patterns in play. At the north pole, eight cyclones rotate around a single storm, whereas at the south pole, five cyclones encircle the central storm. Far horizon\nThe origins of these cyclones and how they persist without merging, or letting another storm muscle in, remain unknown, however. Alberto Adriani, the lead author on the paper from the Institute for Space Astrophysics and Planetology, Italy, said: \"Each one of the northern cyclones is almost as wide as the distance between Naples, Italy, and New York City - and the southern ones are even larger than that. They have very violent winds, reaching, in some cases, speeds as great as 220mph (350km/h). \"Finally, and perhaps most remarkably, they are very close together and enduring. There is nothing else like it that we know of in the Solar System.\" Commenting on all the latest work, Leigh Fletcher, from Leicester University, UK, said Juno was really now starting to deliver on its promise. He believes that what we have learned at Jupiter, and at Saturn with Nasa's Cassini probe, will now heighten the desire to send missions to the other giants in the Solar System. \"We've been lobbying for years to go to Uranus and Neptune, and we're hoping that in the next few years the Americans will put it right at the top of their agenda, after the next mission out to Jupiter's moon Europa. \"That would mean by the late 2020s or early 2030s, we'd have a real mission to head out to those planets.\" Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos ",

        "content": "Hollywood actress Susan Sarandon has revealed that the late Paul Newman once gave her part of his salary. It's believed to have happened when they starred together in the 1998 film Twilight, which also featured Gene Hackman. Sarandon told BBC 5 live's Anna Foster that she discovered that her two male stars were getting paid the same as each other - and more than her. She said Newman stepped in and said: \"Well I'll give you part of mine.\" In an interview to mark the release of her new project, Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story, Sarandon told 5 live: \"Emma Stone once came forward and said she got equal pay, because her male stars insisted upon it and gave up something of theirs. \"That happened to me with Paul Newman at one point, when I did a film with him ages ago.\" She continued: \"They said it was 'favoured nations', but they only meant the two guys. \"He stepped forward and said, 'Well I'll give you part of mine'. So, yeah, he was a gem.\" The term \"favoured nations\" is an agreement between a producer and an actor, which ensures the actors are given the same terms as their co-stars. In Twilight, all three stars were given equal billing on the poster, but Sarandon has now revealed that only Newman and Hackman benefited from the favoured nations arrangement. On International Women's Day, Susan Sarandon also told 5 live that there will \"always be a casting couch\" in Hollywood. \"I think what will go away is the unwanted exchange. \"But I think that giving yourself sexually, or being drawn to power and wanting to have sex with someone that's in power, is also a choice. \"What we don't want to have is being exploited and have the Harvey Weinsteins of the world holding it over your head and holding it over your project. \"That is the most despicable.\" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Liam Gallagher: No, no, no, but we're getting closer and closer to each other, aren't we? Chris Evans: This is what's so intriguing about this, you see. You're like two sperm whales eyeing each other up from miles apart. Liam Gallagher: Yeah that is it, mate. We're getting closer and closer, we're gonna collide, mate, one day and who knows what will happen? The gigs are part of the Biggest Weekend - the largest music event ever attempted by the BBC. The venues in Scotland and England will feature music from Radios 2 and 3, while Radio 1 will take over Swansea's Singleton Park with a bill including Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift, Craig David and Wolf Alice. And BBC 6 Music will head to the Titanic Quarter in Belfast with artists like Beck, Manic Street Preachers, Courtney Barnett and Breeders. The Radio 1 stages are sold out, but tickets for the other events are still available. The Gallagher brothers' headline slots come after almost nine years of acrimony. Oasis broke up at a gig in Paris in 2009 after an altercation that began with Liam throwing a plum at his older brother's head. They've barely spoken since but have engaged in a long war of words in the press, on stage and social media. Liam repeatedly called Noel a \"massive potato\" on Twitter and, more seriously, accused him of deliberately avoiding last year's One Love concert in Manchester. Noel responded by saying Liam was a \"village idiot\" who \"needs to see a psychiatrist\". Liam performed at the One Love event, which was held two weeks after the Manchester Arena terror attack in May, while Noel headlined the venue's reopening concert in September. By Christmas, the brothers seemed to have buried the hatchet. Liam tweeted that Noel had \"reached out\" and that they were \"all good again\". They're clearly not at the point where they could appear together on stage yet... but the Biggest Weekend gig would appear to be the first time both brothers have shared such a billing at a festival. As for an Oasis reunion? Even if Liam is keen, don't hold your breath. \"I've been very consistent about it,\" Noel told Q Magazine in 2017. \"I don't need the money, I don't need the glory, I don't need to relive the memories. \"If I was to get Oasis back together tomorrow and then do a tour, I'd have $100m in the bank but I'd have learnt [expletive] all.\" \"It would be the death of me as a person.\" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

        "content": "The Co-operative is being investigated by the supermarket regulator over its treatment of suppliers. The Groceries Code Adjudicator (GCA) said there was \"reasonable suspicion\" the retailer had breached its rules. It will look into Co-op's \"de-listing\" of suppliers, and charges levied for comparing and assessing products to put on its supermarket shelves. The Co-op accepted it had \"fallen short\" and disclosed it had already repaid \u00a3500,000 to 110 suppliers. The retailer, still trying to re-build profits after a long restructuring, added that it had taken \"decisive steps\" to improve matters and would be writing to all its 1,500 suppliers. However, GCA chief Christine Tacon said she had decided to launch a full investigation \"to fully understand the extent to which the code may have been broken and the root causes of the issues as well as their impact on suppliers\". \"In particular, the investigation will consider the extent, scale and impact of practices which may have resulted in suppliers being de-listed with no, or short, fixed notice periods unilaterally imposed by Co-operative Group Limited without due consideration of published GCA de-listing guidance.\" 'Very sorry'\nJo Whitfield, chief executive of Co-op Food, said the company acknowledged it had \"fallen short\" and has been in talks with the GCA for months. The retailer said that as part of its changes, 110 suppliers had been refunded a total of about \u00a3500,000 in fees for product assessments - so-called benchmarking. Other measures include: Ms Whitfield said: \"We care deeply about our relationships with our suppliers and we are very sorry that... we have failed to live up to our usual high standards. \"We are already addressing the issues with the GCA and our suppliers and we hope the investigation will help bring to light any additional cases so that we can put these right as quickly as possible.\" The GCA, which was set up to ensure that the 10 large supermarket groups treat their direct suppliers lawfully and fairly, has the power to fine retailers up to 1% of annual turnover. In 2016, the ombudsman found that Tesco \"knowingly delayed paying money to suppliers in order to improve its own financial position\". However, back then the GCA had no powers to fine supermarkets, only to make recommendations. The GCA, an independent regulator which reports to the Department for Business and Energy and Industrial Strategy, wants suppliers and related parties to provide any evidence by 3 May. ",

        "content": "For days, Russia's main national TV channels were practically silent on the attempt to kill former spy Sergei Skripal with a nerve agent, but this changed in Thursday's main evening bulletins. The comment by Kirill Kleimenov - the presenter on government-controlled Channel One's flagship Vremya news programme - sounded like a veiled, mocking threat to anyone considering becoming a double agent for Britain. \"I don't wish death on anyone, but for purely educational purposes, I have a warning for anyone who dreams of such a career,\" he said. \"The profession of a traitor is one of the most dangerous in the world,\" Kleimenov said, adding that few who had chosen it had lived to a ripe old age. Alcoholism, drug addiction, stress and depression resulting in heart attacks and even suicide were the \"professional illnesses of a traitor\", according to Kleimenov. 'Maybe it's the climate'\nHe also had a second piece of advice for such \"traitors or those who simply hate their country in their free time\": \"Don't choose Britain as a place to live.\" \"Something is wrong there. Maybe it's the climate, but in recent years there have been too many strange incidents with grave outcomes there.\" The remarks stood out from the rest of the evening's coverage, which followed the line often taken by Russian state media in similar circumstances - denial and wry bemusement that anyone should be pointing the finger at Russia. On NTV - ultimately controlled by state gas company Gazprom - a presenter said the Western media were accusing Russia of poisoning Mr Skripal despite the lack of any evidence or any \"expert conclusions\". Its London correspondent, Liza Gerson, mentioned the role of the UK's Porton Down research facility in the investigation, pointing out that it tested chemicals used against German soldiers in World War One. She also took a swipe at Boris Johnson's warning to Russia this week, saying the foreign secretary was known for his \"unpredictable antics\" and was \"an infant in a man's suit\". Over on state channel Rossiya 1, the presenter said the British authorities \"didn't even try\" to seek Russia's co-operation in the investigation, \"but have already discovered a Russian trace in the case\". 'Anti-Russian hysteria'\nBefore the leading TV channels picked up the story, it had been widely covered by newspapers, news websites and niche liberal outlets such as Dozhd TV and Ekho Moskvy radio, as well as the relatively little-watched state news channel Rossiya 24. \"The British media continue to fan anti-Russian hysteria,\" one Rossiya 24 report said, adding that attempts to find a \"Kremlin trace\" were based \"not on facts, but purely on rumours and fabrication\". The channel's UK correspondent reported the \"interesting detail\" that Britain's \"secret\" Porton Down facility manufactures the VX and sarin nerve agents, as well as other \"UK weapons of mass destruction\". News websites widely reported remarks by Andrei Lugovoi - a suspect in the killing of former Russian security officer Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 - dismissing talk of a \"Russian trace\". \"The English suffer from phobias,\" Mr Lugovoi - now a member of the Russian parliament - told the RIA Novosti news agency. Dozhd TV's take was entirely different from the state media. Here, a presenter said that the discovery that Mr Skripal was poisoned by a nerve agent means \"Russia is in for a high-profile criminal investigation\".

        "content": "Two men have been arrested after a video of racist slurs being shouted in university accommodation emerged. Rufaro Chisango tweeted the video of the abuse which included \"we hate blacks\" while locked in her room at Nottingham Trent University (NTU) halls of residence on Wednesday. NTU has suspended the \"suspected perpetrators\" pending inquiries. Two 18-year-old men have been arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated public order offences. Miss Chisango, who filmed the chanting on Monday evening, tweeted: \"yoo I'm fuming, the way people in the same uni halls as me are chanting 'we hate the blacks' outside my bedroom door. \"Words cannot describe how sad this makes me feel, in this 2018 people think this is still acceptable.\" She told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she \"felt really shocked, isolated and uncomfortable\" when she heard the \"shouting outside my door\". \"It was a big impact obviously, when it happened. It shouldn't be tolerated at all.\" Miss Chisango had reported the abuse to the university halls of residence reception on Tuesday, but the NTU was only informed on Wednesday. She said: \"It shouldn't have [taken] such a long delay when I reported something like this. \"I just want the appropriate action to be taken.\" NTU said it was \"shocked and appalled\" to see the video and was investigating \"as a matter of urgency\". \"We are also working with our accommodation partner to understand why the university was only alerted to this on Wednesday evening after this was reported to them in the very early hours of Tuesday. Nottinghamshire Police said: \"We treat hate crime as a priority.\" Labour MP for Tottenham David Lammy said: \"My heart breaks for this young woman and I have the utmost respect for her bravery in speaking out.\" Ilyas Nagdee, 23, National Union of Students officer representing students of African, Arab, Asian and Caribbean descent, said these experiences are \"common\". \"We've seen examples of incidents like the racist writing on bananas at Warwick, the Confederate flag at Manchester and now shouting through the door in Nottingham. \"These are just the stories that go viral over social media. But unfortunately this is the day-to-day experience of students of colour across the country and it has been going on for decades. \"I'm contacted at least a couple of times a week by students asking me for help after experiencing racism.\" ",

        "content": "A video showing the moment an orange fireball engulfed a Tube train has been shown to jurors at the Old Bailey. A bomb exploded on the District Line on 15 September, 2017, and prosecutors allege that Ahmed Hassan built the device and set the timer. The footage showed commuters cowering from flames and fleeing on to the platform. Mr Hassan denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. CCTV allegedly shows him leaving the train one stop earlier at Putney Bridge station, having left a bag behind. Detective Constable Andrew Leonard told the court that Mr Hassan was not seen to put his hand inside the bag at any point. He was arrested at the Port of Dover the next day. 'A bang and screaming'\nMany of the 93 people caught in the bombing suffered burns or were crushed in the stampede to get out, the court heard. Prosecutor Alison Morgan has said experts concluded it was simply \"luck\" that the bomb did not fully detonate. A victim, referred to in court as Miss S, was a metre away from the device when it exploded. She told the jury there was \"a bang [and] people screaming\". She added: \"I had burns, my knees were bad, my face was all burned. My coat was burning, my tights melted.\" Aimee Colville, who got on the train at Parsons Green moments before the explosion, said she saw a \"wall of glass\" coming towards her. She said: \"I don't know if I physically got myself down or if I blacked out, but at that point I noticed a flame come over my right side. \"It came over my side and that is when I smelt the burning.\" She added: \"That morning I had curled my hair and I had put hairspray in my hair, so when the flames came over me my hair immediately caught fire.\" Lucinda Glazebrook, who also boarded the train at Parsons Green, told the court she felt the heat from the fireball on her face. \"I kept touching my face and feeling the back of my hair and my hair was coming out in chunks,\" she said. Journey before attack\nA number of other videos allegedly showing Mr Hassan's movements on the day of the attack have been shown to the jury by prosecutors. The first video is said by prosecutors to show him leaving his foster home in Sunbury, Surrey, carrying a plastic bag, which they told the court contained the device that exploded on the underground train. A second then allegedly shows Mr Hassan catching a train to Wimbledon. And CCTV from the platform allegedly showed him going into the station toilets - where prosecutors said he set the timer on the device - and emerging 13 minutes later carrying the bag and heading towards the District Line platforms. Further footage was also shown, which prosecutors said showed Mr Hassan from a day before the attack going to two supermarkets - an Asda and an Aldi in Feltham - buying matches, batteries, a screw driver and screw driver bit sets, allegedly used to construct the device. UK arrival\nJurors were told on Wednesday that Mr Hassan had arrived in Britain in the back of a lorry via the Channel Tunnel in October 2015. He told authorities he was born in June 1999 in Iraq, but had no identity documents. He gave his name as Ahmed Hassan Mohammed Ali. He claimed asylum, and from 2016 lived with foster parents in Cavendish Road, Sunbury. At the time he allegedly planned his attack, his asylum claim was still outstanding, the court heard. The trial continues. ",

        "content": "Women workers in Spain are marking International Women's Day with an unprecedented strike targeting gender inequality and sexual discrimination. Work was being halted as part of a 24-hour strike organised by the 8 March Commission and backed by 10 unions and some of Spain's top women politicians. Hundreds of marches with the slogan \"if we stop, the world stops\" are planned. International Women's Day events are also being held in dozens of other nations across the world. What's happening in Spain?\nWomen taking part are stopping work and have been urged by organisers to spend no money and ditch any domestic chores for the day. One of the effects will be the cancellation of 300 trains on Thursday, the transport ministry said, with Madrid's underground network also disrupted. Marches in Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Valencia and a number of other cities were leading events in 200 Spanish locations. The 8 March Commission is behind the strike. Its manifesto calls for \"a society free of sexist oppression, exploitation and violence\" and says: \"We do not accept worse working conditions, nor being paid less than men for the same work.\" El Pais said most sectors would be affected and a poll of 1,500 people for the daily newspaper suggested 82% supported the strike, while 76% thought women in Spain had harder lives than men. Feminist groups only want women to strike, to show how important their absence is, but Spanish law does not allow for single-gender strikes and men were welcome to support it. Some have opposed the strike. The ruling centre-right party, the Partido Popular (PP), said the action was \"for feminist elites and not real women with everyday problems\". However, two of the five female ministers in Spain's conservative government, Agriculture Minister Isabel Garc\u00eda Tejerina and the president of the Madrid region Cristina Cifuentes, have said they will be observing a day of work-to-rule. Actress Penelope Cruz cancelled planned public events and said she would go on \"domestic\" strike. The mayors of Madrid and Barcelona - Manuela Carmena and Ada Colau - are also backing the strike. In Spain, women were paid 13% and 19% less than their male counterparts in the public and private sectors respectively, data from the European Union's statistical provider Eurostat said. You might also like:\nWhat's happening elsewhere in the world?\nHere's a round-up of some of the International Women's Day events so far: While leaders across Africa praised the role of women, the government in Ivory Coast decided to update a list of jobs that women are banned from doing. The labour laws now preclude \"work that exceeds the ability and physical capacity of women, or work that presents dangers which is likely to undermine their morality, for example, working underground or in the mines\". What has the social media response been?\nUK PM Theresa May announced the launch of a consultation to improve protection of those suffering domestic abuse. She sent out a tweet in support of International Women's Day.

        "content": "The two Koreas will not march together at the opening ceremony of the Winter Paralympics in Pyeongchang on Friday, officials in the South have said. The North had wanted disputed islands to be put on a unified flag but the South disagreed. The two nations marched together under an agreed unified flag at the opening of the Winter Olympics on 9 February. That had been seen as part of a gradual rapprochement in bilateral ties and the nations later agreed a leaders' summit. The summit is expected to discuss how to reduce tension on the peninsula. \"After discussion with the North, the two Koreas decided not to march together at the opening ceremony,\" the South's Yonhap news agency quoted the South Korean Paralympic Committee (KPC) as saying on Thursday. The unified flag shows the Korean peninsula in blue on a white background. The KPC said the North wanted the South's Dodko islands, which Japan claims, on the flag, saying the omission hurt Koreans. The South said inclusion would run counter to the International Paralympic Committee's recommendation not to politicise sports events. The KPC said the two Koreas had decided to respect each other's stance and march separately. The apparent rapprochement over the Winter Olympics had seen the selection of a joint women's ice hockey team, the deployment of a squad of North Korean cheerleaders and most significantly a high-level Northern delegation that included Kim Yo-jong - the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The charm offensive was hailed by some as a breakthrough in relations but conservatives in the South issued warnings and the US was unmoved in its tough diplomatic stance. Message to the US\nIn the wake of the Games, the two Koreas held a landmark diplomatic meeting in the North's capital, Pyongyang, earlier this week. A South Korean delegation is now en route to the US and is expected to pass on a message from the North's leader, Kim Jong-un. The US, which only this week increased its sanctions on Pyongyang over the death in Malaysia of Mr Kim's brother, Kim Jong-nam, has said it is open to talking to North Korea but only if it commits to denuclearisation. China has welcomed the forthcoming talks but warned it was too early to assume they would bring a lasting breakthrough on the central nuclear issue. The past year has seen a rising war of words between the US and North Korea, with the North test-firing increasingly powerful missiles. The last time major international talks were held to persuade North Korea to disarm were the Six-Party Talks involving North and South Korea, the US, China Japan, and Russia. North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear and weapons programme in exchange for aid and reduced sanctions. But the talks broke down in 2008 after failing to agree on how to verify the North's commitments, and in 2009 North Korea conducted its second nuclear weapons test. ",

Rufaro Chisango tweeted the video of the abuse which included \"we hate the blacks\" while locked in her room at Nottingham Trent University (NTU) halls of residence on Wednesday. NTU has suspended the \"suspected perpetrators\" pending inquiries. Two 18-year-old men have been arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated public order offences. Miss Chisango, who filmed the chanting on Monday evening, tweeted: \"yoo I'm fuming, the way people in the same uni halls as me are chanting 'we hate the blacks' outside my bedroom door. \"Words cannot describe how sad this makes me feel, in this 2018 people think this is still acceptable.\" She told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she \"felt really shocked, isolated and uncomfortable\" when she heard the \"shouting outside my door\". \"It was a big impact obviously, when it happened. It shouldn't be tolerated at all.\" Miss Chisango had reported the abuse to the university halls of residence reception on Tuesday, but the NTU was only informed on Wednesday. She said: \"It shouldn't have [taken] such a long delay when I reported something like this. \"I just want the appropriate action to be taken.\" NTU said it was \"shocked and appalled\" to see the video and was investigating \"as a matter of urgency\". \"We are also working with our accommodation partner to understand why the university was only alerted to this on Wednesday evening after this was reported to them in the very early hours of Tuesday.

        "content": "A video showing the moment an orange fireball engulfed a Tube train has been shown to jurors at the Old Bailey. A bomb exploded on the District Line on 15 September, 2017, and prosecutors allege that Ahmed Hassan built the device and set the timer. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. Witnesses told the court about the \"chaos\" of the incident, describing a \"rolling fireball\", a \"wall of glass\" and \"people screaming\" in the carriage. CCTV allegedly shows Mr Hassan leaving the train one stop earlier at Putney Bridge station, having left a bag behind. Detective Constable Andrew Leonard told the court that Mr Hassan was not seen to put his hand inside the bag at any point. He was arrested at the Port of Dover the next day. 'Slow motion'\nMany of the 93 people caught in the bombing suffered burns or were crushed in the stampede to get out, the court heard. Prosecutor Alison Morgan has said experts concluded it was simply \"luck\" that the bomb did not fully detonate. Retired counter-terrorism officer Alex Beavan had boarded the train at Wimbledon and was standing near the doors when the bomb went off. \"I heard a huge popping sound,\" he said. \"Looking towards the direction of the sound, I saw a rolling fireball coming over the ceiling at the back of the train. \"I saw the rolling fireball, wall to wall, slowly coming up the ceiling. He added: \"Everything goes in slow motion. There was a woman. I could see her realise what was happening and she began screaming and some men were shouting 'run'. \"There was chaos and I was thinking there is going to be a second attack so I ran across the platform.\" A victim, referred to in court as Miss S, was a metre away from the device when it exploded. She said: \"I had burns, my knees were bad, my face was all burned. My coat was burning, my tights melted.\" Aimee Colville, who got on the train at Parsons Green moments before the explosion, said she saw a \"wall of glass\" coming towards her. She said: \"I don't know if I physically got myself down or if I blacked out, but at that point I noticed a flame come over my right side. \"That morning I had curled my hair and I had put hairspray in my hair, so when the flames came over me my hair immediately caught fire.\" Lucinda Glazebrook, who also boarded the train at Parsons Green, told the court she felt the heat from the fireball on her face. \"I kept touching my face and feeling the back of my hair and my hair was coming out in chunks,\" she said. Journey before attack\nA number of other videos allegedly showing Mr Hassan's movements on the day of the attack have been shown to the jury by prosecutors. The first video is said by prosecutors to show him leaving his foster home in Sunbury, Surrey, carrying a plastic bag, which they told the court contained the device that exploded on the underground train. A second then allegedly shows Mr Hassan catching a train to Wimbledon. And CCTV from the platform allegedly showed him going into the station toilets - where prosecutors said he set the timer on the device - and emerging 13 minutes later carrying the bag and heading towards the District Line platforms. Further footage was also shown, which prosecutors said showed Mr Hassan from a day before the attack going to two supermarkets - an Asda and an Aldi in Feltham - buying matches, batteries, a screw driver and screw driver bit sets, allegedly used to construct the device. UK arrival\nJurors were told on Wednesday that Mr Hassan had arrived in Britain in the back of a lorry via the Channel Tunnel in October 2015. He told authorities he was born in June 1999 in Iraq, but had no identity documents. He gave his name as Ahmed Hassan Mohammed Ali. He claimed asylum, and from 2016 lived with foster parents in Cavendish Road, Sunbury. At the time he allegedly planned his attack, his asylum claim was still outstanding, the court heard. The trial continues. ",

According to North Korean news website DPRK Today, one will be about a farmer's struggle against Japanese soldiers who are trying to \"steal ginseng from the people\"; while the other will be about a secret agent fighting \"evil enemies\" attempting to destroy the country. The struggle against the Japanese occupation of the Korean peninsula, which ended in 1945 with the defeat of the Japanese Empire in World War II, is fertile ground for North Korean television drama, with Japanese characters commonly portrayed as a greedy and brutal occupying force. DPRK Today says that North Korean production companies are looking to improve the quality of television drama so that they can appeal to international, as well as domestic audiences. State news agency KCNA highlighted the success of glossy 2014 TV series Bulletproof Wall, which won an award at a film festival in Moscow in 2016. The agency said it was \"a truthful artistic depiction of the tradition of devotedly defending the leader established by the anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners and the noble mental spirit of patriots\". However, international sales of North Korean television content are currently all but impossible given sanctions by the United Nations. Narrow point of reference\nNorth Korea's Central TV regularly airs films depicting personal sacrifices made in the patriotic struggle against both Japanese and American foes, and it's this narrow point of reference which limits drama and film making in the country. Writing for the Institution for Peace Affairs in 2016, North Korean defector Jung Myung-ho said that most dramas are designed to justify the North Korean government's ideologies and to promote patriotism and loyalty as key attributes for the people. Mr Jung says, based on his time living in North Korea, that younger people who have not experienced war are less interested in these dramas, even if they are the only thing to watch \"when the electricity is working\". Central Television is a daily diet of programming aimed at glorifying the Kim family regime and a military-first society. Even children's programmes carry messages of party loyalty and patriotism; while adult viewers are never more than a few minutes away from martial music or images of the country's leadership and military might.

        "content": "The attempted murder of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, using a nerve agent was a \"brazen and reckless attack\", Amber Rudd has said. Both Mr Skripal and his daughter are still critically ill after being found collapsed on a bench in Salisbury city centre on Sunday. Counter-terrorism officers are working to find the origin of the nerve agent. A police officer, who was in intensive care, is now \"stable and conscious\", Wiltshire's chief constable said. Addressing the House of Commons, the home secretary said the attack was \"attempted murder in the most cruel and public way\". Ms Rudd told MPs it was an \"outrageous crime\", adding that the government would \"act without hesitation as the facts become clearer\". She refused to speculate on whether the Russian state might have been involved in the attack, saying the police investigation should be based on \"facts, not rumour\". However, she said the government was committed to bringing the perpetrators to justice \"whoever they are and wherever they may be\". A Downing Street spokesman described the attack as an \"appalling and reckless crime\" and said those responsible would face a \"robust\" response. Earlier, Ms Rudd said the nerve agent used in the poisoning was \"very rare\". Police said government scientists had identified the nerve agent used, but would not make that information public at this stage. The source familiar with the investigation told the BBC it was likely to be rarer than the Sarin gas thought to have been used in Syria and in an attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995. And it was said not to be VX - the nerve agent used to kill the half brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Malaysia last year. Analysis\nBy Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent The fact the nerve agent is \"very rare\" will help the investigation narrow its focus. Making nerve agents and delivering them requires considerable infrastructure and the more unusual the agent the easier it will be to locate which country, even which laboratory, might be involved. That combined with police leads on who delivered the agent will form the basis for a determination of responsibility, along with any other intelligence that can be gathered. It may take days - even weeks - for the government to be confident enough to make a public statement, because it will not want to risk getting any details wrong. But if suspicions about Russia are confirmed, then some kind of action seems inevitable. The legacy of the 2006 Litvinenko case shows that expelling diplomats alone may not be regarded as much of a deterrent to future acts. Economic sanctions on the Russian elite may have more bite, but would require greater political will. Mr Skripal, 66, was convicted of passing secrets to MI6 but was given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a \"spy swap\". It is known that he and his 33-year-old daughter had visited the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found collapsed on a bench near the Maltings shopping centre. A witness, who saw the pair at the restaurant, told the BBC Mr Skripal was acting \"very strange\" and was \"very agitated\". \"He seemed to lose his temper... and he just started screaming at the top of his voice, he wanted his bill and he wanted to go.\" Police have yet to say if they know how and where the poison was administered. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said Russia was becoming an \"ever greater threat\", amid speculation the attack could have some element of state involvement. \"Russia's being assertive, Russia's being more aggressive, and we have to change the way that we deal with it because we can't be in a situation in these areas of conflict where we are being pushed around by another nation,\" he told ITV's Good Morning Britain. Police said they wanted to speak to anyone who was in the centre of Salisbury on Sunday afternoon. They are particularly keen to hear from people who ate at Zizzi or drank in the Mill pub between 13:00 and 16:00 GMT. Both sites remain closed to the public. BBC correspondent Leila Nathoo said there had been \"a flurry of activity\" outside Mr Skripal's Salisbury home at lunchtime. She said ambulances and an incident response team were in attendance and a police tent had been erected outside the house. Part of a business park in nearby Amesbury also remains cordoned off. Speaking on Wednesday, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said: \"This is being treated as a major incident involving attempted murder, by administration of a nerve agent. He said Mr Skripal and his daughter were \"targeted specifically\". \"Our role now of course is to establish who is behind this and why they carried out this act,\" he added. Nerve agents are highly toxic chemicals that stop the nervous system working and shut down bodily functions. They normally enter the body through the mouth or nose, but can also be absorbed through the eyes or skin. Mr Rowley said there was no evidence of a widespread health risk to the public. Hundreds of detectives, forensic officers, analysts and intelligence officers are working on the case, which has drawn comparison with the killing of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko with radioactive polonium-210 in London in 2006. A public inquiry concluded his death was probably carried out with the approval of President Vladimir Putin. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs on Tuesday the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the Skripal case. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, but is open to co-operating with British police if requested. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said foreign media had used the case as part of an anti-Russian campaign. Who is Sergei Skripal?\nSergei Skripal is a retired Russian military intelligence colonel who was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Mr Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years. Do you have any information to share on this story?

        "content": "The New York Times has corrected an article that mistakenly referred to the Great Depression of the 1930s as \"the time of shedding and cold rocks\". One of its editors had installed software that adds references to snakes to websites. The substitution was missed and published online, but did not appear in the print edition of the newspaper. The newspaper blamed an \"editing error involving a satirical text-swapping web browser extension\". The Millennials to Snake People add-on for Google's Chrome browser was created by coder Eric Bailey, who had noticed a surge in news stories blaming so-called millennials for the world's problems.

McDonald's have flipped their logo upside-down \"in celebration of women everywhere,\" according to a statement from Wendy Lewis, the fast food chain's chief diversity officer. The inverted golden arches can be seen on McDonald's United States social media channels, and on a signpost outside one restaurant in Lynwood, California, USA. But the act has been branded \"McFeminism\" by some people who have criticised \"corporate-friendly\" feminism, with others calling for McDonald's to focus on pay rather than \"symbolic gestures\". This is hilarious. Keep your symbolic gesture about women's rights and pay your female (and male) workers a living wage. #McFeminism https://t.co/Cg5as2lkNa End of Twitter post by @KyleKulinski You may also like: Many have joined the conversation by calling for McDonald's to pay their staff a minimum wage of $15 (\u00a310.81) per hour. For some people this alone would not be enough. American Muslim lawyer and writer Qasim Rashid tweeted about the need for more women and minorities to be hired in leadership positions, while another suggested the franchise could try to offer \"a career path forward in the face of automation\". McDonalds: In celebration of women we are flipping the arches upside down. Or you could give your employees better benefits. McD: Look it's a W! Maybe a living wage? Better family leave? A career path forward in the face of automation? McD: The W stands for women. End of Twitter post by @truebe However, one reply pointed out their local franchise \"pays $11.50 and full benefits\". And not everyone was critical of McDonald's move, with Antonio J Lucio, Chief Marketing Officer of computer manufacturer HP calling it an \"iconic statement\". But others disagreed, with a Twitter user joking that the move was a way to avoid paying staff more. Cost-Benefit Analyst: it's cheaper to change all our signs than pay our women (and men) employees a living wage. McDonalds: done!#McFeminism End of Twitter post by @themariosantana And Leon Martins, a YouTuber with over seven million subscribers, suggested that because the Portugese for woman is mulher, \"McDonald's in Brazil are honouring Women's Day all year round\". Meanwhile, for some people the upside-down logo had a different meaning entirely as online references were posted to \"WcDonald's\" - a brand name which often appears in anime series to get around copyright laws. This prompted one person to jokingly praise McDonald's \"unprecedented show of support for anime\", while another shared a still from the show InuYasha featuring characters in a restaurant with a now-familiar W on the window.

        "content": "Claim: In the past six months, the rate of executions in Saudi Arabia has doubled. Reality Check verdict: Emily Thornberry's office clarified to BBC Reality Check that she meant the past eight months, not six months. Saudi Arabia does not release official statistics on the number of executions it carries out. However, her figures are broadly correct, according to prominent human rights organisations. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry made the claim in an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday, while criticising what she called the UK government's \"red-carpet treatment\" of the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's three-day visit to the UK. BBC Reality Check contacted her office to ask for her source - her office clarified that she had misspoken and that she had meant the rate of executions had doubled in the past eight months, since July 2017. Mohammed bin Salman was made crown prince in June 2017. Number of executions\nThe Saudi government does not release official statistics on the number of executions it carries out, but state media does report frequently on executions. Ms Thornberry's figures come from Reprieve, a human-rights campaign organisation - its figures come from a compilation of these state media reports, which are publicly available. BBC Reality Check has seen the organisation's database of these reports. Between July 2017 and February 2018, Reprieve says, there were 133 executions in Saudi Arabia (on average 16.6 a month), compared with 67 between October 2016 and May 2017 (on average 8.4 a month). In June 2017, most of which was in the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, the organisation found no reports of executions. Reprieve's figures are broadly in line with those of Human Rights Watch, another campaign group, which has separately compiled Saudi Press Agency reports. Human Rights Watch says there were 138 executions between July 2017 and February 2018, and 68 for the earlier period. Global comparison\nA lack of transparency around execution figures is not uncommon - most of the data for international comparisons comes from human rights organisations such as Reprieve and Amnesty International. In 2016, these two organisations' figures were broadly in agreement. Based on these figures, globally Saudi Arabia ranks third highest in the world, behind China and Iran. Both said that China had executed the most people, although they were unable to provide a figure - the number of executions is a state secret in China, and the groups say they believe that those reported in the media \"are likely to be a fraction of those that are carried out\". Similarly, although Amnesty International puts the number of executions in Iran at more than 567, and Reprieve has the lower figure of more than 534, Reprieve notes that \"the actual number of executions is likely to be higher... given the government's under-reporting of executions and the holding of secret executions\". In a press release, Reprieve pointed out that the doubling of executions had coincided with Mohammed bin Salman's appointment as crown prince, \"in marked contrast to the headline-grabbing reforms that have been introduced in the Kingdom\". Dr Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, from the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University, told the BBC that the number of executions had escalated sharply in 2015. \"My reading is that the higher rate of executions is partly due to a decision by the Saudi authorities to carry out a large number of death sentences that had been imposed but not acted upon during the reign of King Abdullah,\" he said. \"It's hard to pinpoint any one issue over the past eight months which might explain why there has been such a sudden jump,\" he added. A researcher for Human Rights Watch said that the lack of transparency from the Saudi authorities made it \"hard to find a pattern to it all\". Saudi Arabia's record on human rights has come under scrutiny during the crown prince's visit, with the leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, challenging Theresa May on it during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday. The prime minister said she would be raising human rights issues with the crown prince. Reality Check contacted the Saudi Arabian embassy in London for comment but had not received a reply at the time of publication.

        "content": "Women workers in Spain are marking International Women's Day with an unprecedented strike targeting gender inequality and sexual discrimination. Work was being halted as part of a 24-hour strike organised by the 8 March Commission and backed by 10 unions and some of Spain's top women politicians. Hundreds of marches with the slogan \"if we stop, the world stops\" are planned. International Women's Day events are also being held in dozens of other nations across the world. What's happening in Spain?\nWomen taking part are stopping work and have been urged by organisers to spend no money and ditch any domestic chores for the day. One of the effects will be the cancellation of 300 trains on Thursday, the transport ministry said, with Madrid's underground network also disrupted. Marches in Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Valencia and a number of other cities were leading events in 200 Spanish locations. The 8 March Commission is behind the strike. Its manifesto calls for \"a society free of sexist oppression, exploitation and violence\" and says: \"We do not accept worse working conditions, nor being paid less than men for the same work.\" El Pais said most sectors would be affected and a poll of 1,500 people for the daily newspaper suggested 82% supported the strike, while 76% thought women in Spain had harder lives than men. Feminist groups only want women to strike, to show how important their absence is, but Spanish law does not allow for single-gender strikes and men were welcome to support it. Some have opposed the strike. The ruling centre-right party, the Partido Popular (PP), said the action was \"for feminist elites and not real women with everyday problems\". However, two of the five female ministers in Spain's conservative government, Agriculture Minister Isabel Garc\u00eda Tejerina and the president of the Madrid region Cristina Cifuentes, have said they will be observing a day of work-to-rule. Actress Penelope Cruz cancelled planned public events and said she would go on \"domestic\" strike. The mayors of Madrid and Barcelona - Manuela Carmena and Ada Colau - are also backing the strike. In Spain, women were paid 13% and 19% less than their male counterparts in the public and private sectors respectively, data from the European Union's statistical provider Eurostat said. You might also like:\nWhat's happening elsewhere in the world?\nHere's a round-up of some of the International Women's Day events so far: While leaders across Africa praised the role of women, the government in Ivory Coast decided to update a list of jobs that women are banned from doing. The labour laws now preclude \"work that exceeds the ability and physical capacity of women, or work that presents dangers which is likely to undermine their morality, for example, working underground or in the mines\". What has the social media response been?\nUK PM Theresa May announced the launch of a consultation to improve protection of those suffering domestic abuse. She sent out a tweet in support of International Women's Day.

Rufaro Chisango tweeted the video of the abuse which apparently included \"we hate the blacks\" while locked in her room at Nottingham Trent University (NTU) halls of residence on Wednesday. NTU has suspended the \"suspected perpetrators\" pending inquiries. Two 18-year-old men have been arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated public order offences. Miss Chisango, who filmed the chanting on Monday evening, tweeted: \"yoo I'm fuming, the way people in the same uni halls as me are chanting 'we hate the blacks' outside my bedroom door. \"Words cannot describe how sad this makes me feel, in this 2018 people think this is still acceptable.\" She told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she \"felt really shocked, isolated and uncomfortable\" when she heard the \"shouting outside my door\". \"It was a big impact obviously, when it happened. It shouldn't be tolerated at all.\" Miss Chisango had reported the abuse to the university halls of residence reception on Tuesday, but the NTU was only informed on Wednesday. She said: \"It shouldn't have [taken] such a long delay when I reported something like this. \"I just want the appropriate action to be taken.\" NTU said it was \"shocked and appalled\" to see the video and was investigating \"as a matter of urgency\". \"We are also working with our accommodation partner to understand why the university was only alerted to this on Wednesday evening after this was reported to them in the very early hours of Tuesday.

        "content": "Police say a nerve agent was used in an attempt to murder the Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury, Wiltshire. The pair are critically ill, along with a police officer who was among the first to attend the scene. But what are nerve agents and what do they do? What are nerve agents?\nThey are highly toxic chemicals that prevent the nervous system from working properly, and can be fatal. They take different forms - including powder and gas - but they tend to be a liquid, which can seep through the skin. \"Nerve agents are possibly some of the most dangerous things that humans have ever made, after the atom bomb,\" says Dr David Caldicott, clinical senior lecturer at the faculty of medicine at Australian National University. What are the different types?\nSome of the better-known nerve agents include: The first three agents are clear, colourless, tasteless liquids. VX, an oily, amber-coloured liquid, is the most deadly - a drop on the skin can kill a person within minutes. What was used in this case?\nPolice have not confirmed what agent was used, but a source has told the BBC it was likely to be rarer than sarin or VX nerve agents - two of the best known. When have they been used in the past?\nThe half-brother of North Korean President Kim Jong-un was killed by a nerve agent in an attack in Malaysia last year. Kim Jong-nam died in less than 20 minutes after two women smeared his face with VX nerve agent ingredients at Kuala Lumpur airport in 2017. The UN says the nerve agent sarin has been used by the Syrian government - in an attack on Ghouta, near Damascus, in 2013 and again in Khan Sheikhoun in the north-west of the country in April 2017, killing hundreds. In an attack on Tokyo's subway system in 1995, which killed 13 people, liquid sarin was placed in plastic bags that were pierced by umbrellas with sharpened tips. When Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned in London in 2006, a radioactive substance - not a nerve agent - called polonium 210 was used in a cup of tea. What do they do to the body?\nNerve agents block the messages from the nerves to the muscles. This causes a collapse of many bodily functions. They will act within seconds or minutes if inhaled and slightly more slowly if exposure is the result of skin contamination. Symptoms include white eyes, as the pupils become constricted, convulsions, drooling and in the worse cases - coma, respiratory failure and death. If you have ever sprayed insect repellent at a fly, you might have seen it drop to the ground and lie on its back, legs twitching. This is the result of nerve agents taking hold. How are they delivered?\nThe nerve agent needs to be ingested, inhaled or to penetrate through the skin, so it usually requires the person delivering it to get very close to the people they are targeting. Only tiny amounts are required for it to take effect. It is so toxic that it would usually be transported in something tightly sealed and those who apply it will need protective clothing. Dr Andrea Sella, professor of inorganic chemistry at University College London, said because of the extreme toxicity of the nerve agents it would be \"very dangerous\" to the person who delivered the poisoning. Is there a risk to the public?\nDespite their extreme toxicity, Dr Sella said the agent posed \"very little risk\" to the public. You would need to be very close to these chemicals to be affected by them. They would also decompose relatively swiftly in damp conditions, Dr Sella said. Dr Hilary Walker, a former radiation scientist and health emergency planner, said there were \"well-rehearsed\" emergency procedures to prevent contamination by these chemicals. These included the hosing down of streets that took place in the immediate aftermath of the incident in Salisbury. What is the treatment?\nThere are antidotes to help reverse the effect of nerve agents, which the emergency services hold. But the sooner the treatment is delivered the better the chance of recovery. Knowing the exact substance enables more targeted treatment. Alastair Hay, emeritus professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds, said the people affected may well have been treated with atropine, which is one of the chemicals used to treat individuals with this type of poisoning. \"The problem occurs if the treatment is not provided quickly,\" Prof Hay said. \"There is paralysis of the nerves and the muscles, and that inhibits breathing and leads to some damage in the brain. At this stage we don't know if that is a problem. \"Many people appear to recover without too many long-term problems but we won't know until we know the severity of their symptoms.\" Where are they made?\nNerve agents are not materials that can be made at home. Their level of toxicity is such that they are only allowed to be manufactured in specialised facilities, such as a university or industrial laboratory. Discovered by accident in the 1930s by scientists trying to find a cost-effective pesticide, they proved to be highly toxic chemicals that eventually ended up in the hands of the German military. Russia, the US and the UK also started to experiment on chemical agents after World War Two and it was British scientists who developed the VX nerve agent at the Porton Down research facility in the early 1950s. Some experts say it is likely the nerve agent used in Salisbury has come from a state. But Dr Simon Cotton, a senior lecturer in chemistry at the University of Birmingham, said it could also have been made by a group with access to the right facilities. \"It could be a state making it but it doesn't have to be. People shouldn't jump to conclusions.\" How do you find where it came from?\nThe authorities would be looking for the container used to deliver the material, as the chemical contents would be a \"goldmine\", Dr Sella said. \"With this information it might well be possible to trace the origin of the substance, just as has been done for the Khan Sheikhoun attack in Syria.\" Chemical weapons expert Hamish de Bretton-Gordon said each country made chemical weapons \"slightly differently\" which might help scientists determine where this attack had come from. \"There is a footprint, there are markers,\" he said.

Stephen Nash was on the District Line underground train on 15 September 2017 when the device went off. CCTV allegedly shows Ahmed Hassan - who prosecutors said built the bomb and set the timer - leaving the train one stop earlier at Putney Bridge station, having left a bag behind. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life, The CCTV footage then showed the moment an orange fireball filled the carriage. Prosecutor Alison Morgan has said experts concluded it was simply \"luck\" that the bomb did not fully detonate. Mr Hassan was arrested at the Port of Dover the day after the attack. 'A blinding flash'\nMr Nash told the court he was was reading a newspaper, \"oblivious\" to what was going on, when the explosion happened. He said: \"At Parsons Green there was a loud bang. There was a blinding flash to my left and I was engulfed in flames. \"I was thrown to the ground. The flames were overwhelming.\" He described an \"intense heat\", before adding: \"I thought I had lost my ears. I thought my head was on fire.\" Mr Nash said he was knocked out, and when he woke up a few seconds later, he was the last person on the train. \"I called out to the Tube,\" he said. \"Just as I got to the doors, the doors started to close. \"It was a little bit scary and I called out on to the platform.\" He was taken to an emergency triage centre in a local pub and has been treated by a plastic surgeon for severe burns to his head and ears. 'Slow motion'\nMr Nash was among a number of witnesses giving evidence at the trial. The court heard that many of the 93 people caught in the bombing suffered burns or were crushed in the stampede to get out. Retired counter-terrorism officer Alex Beavan had boarded the train at Wimbledon and was standing near the doors when the bomb went off. \"I heard a huge popping sound,\" he said. \"Looking towards the direction of the sound, I saw a rolling fireball coming over the ceiling at the back of the train. \"I saw the rolling fireball, wall to wall, slowly coming up the ceiling. He added: \"Everything goes in slow motion. There was a woman. I could see her realise what was happening and she began screaming and some men were shouting 'run'. \"There was chaos and I was thinking there is going to be a second attack so I ran across the platform.\" Aimee Colville, who got on the train at Parsons Green moments before the explosion, said she saw a \"wall of glass\" coming towards her. She said: \"I don't know if I physically got myself down or if I blacked out, but at that point I noticed a flame come over my right side. \"That morning I had curled my hair and I had put hairspray in my hair, so when the flames came over me my hair immediately caught fire.\" Lucinda Glazebrook, who also boarded the train at Parsons Green, told the court she felt the heat from the fireball on her face. \"I kept touching my face and feeling the back of my hair and my hair was coming out in chunks,\" she said. Journey before attack\nA number of other videos allegedly showing Mr Hassan's movements on the day of the attack have been shown to the jury by prosecutors. The first video is said by prosecutors to show him leaving his foster home in Sunbury, Surrey, carrying a plastic bag, which they told the court contained the device that exploded on the underground train. A second then allegedly shows Mr Hassan catching a train to Wimbledon. And CCTV from the platform allegedly shows him going into the station toilets - where prosecutors said he set the timer on the device - and emerging 13 minutes later carrying the bag and heading towards the District Line platforms. Further footage was also shown, which prosecutors said showed Mr Hassan from a day before the attack going to two supermarkets - an Asda and an Aldi in Feltham - buying matches, batteries, a screw driver and screw driver bit sets, allegedly used to construct the device. UK arrival\nJurors were told on Wednesday that Mr Hassan had arrived in Britain in the back of a lorry via the Channel Tunnel in October 2015. He told authorities he was born in June 1999 in Iraq, but had no identity documents. He gave his name as Ahmed Hassan Mohammed Ali. He claimed asylum, and from 2016 lived with foster parents in Cavendish Road, Sunbury. At the time he allegedly planned his attack, his asylum claim was still outstanding, the court heard. The trial continues. ",

        "content": "The attempted murder of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, using a nerve agent was a \"brazen and reckless attack\", Amber Rudd has said. Both Mr Skripal and his daughter are still critically ill after being found collapsed on a bench in Salisbury city centre on Sunday. Counter-terrorism officers are working to find the origin of the nerve agent. A police officer, who was in intensive care, is now \"stable and conscious\", Wiltshire's chief constable said. Addressing the House of Commons, the home secretary said the attack was \"attempted murder in the most cruel and public way\". Ms Rudd told MPs it was an \"outrageous crime\", adding that the government would \"act without hesitation as the facts become clearer\". She refused to speculate on whether the Russian state might have been involved in the attack, saying the police investigation should be based on \"facts, not rumour\". However, she said the government was committed to bringing the perpetrators to justice \"whoever they are and wherever they may be\". Prime Minister Theresa May told ITV News that \"if action needs to be taken then the government will do that\". \"We will do what is appropriate, we will do what is right, if it is proved to be the case that this is state-sponsored,\" she said. Earlier, Ms Rudd said the nerve agent used in the poisoning was \"very rare\". Police said government scientists had identified the nerve agent used, but would not make that information public at this stage. The source familiar with the investigation told the BBC it was likely to be rarer than the Sarin gas thought to have been used in Syria and in an attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995. And it was said not to be VX - the nerve agent used to kill the half brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Malaysia last year. Analysis\nBy Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent The fact the nerve agent is \"very rare\" will help the investigation narrow its focus. Making nerve agents and delivering them requires considerable infrastructure and the more unusual the agent the easier it will be to locate which country, even which laboratory, might be involved. That combined with police leads on who delivered the agent will form the basis for a determination of responsibility, along with any other intelligence that can be gathered. It may take days - even weeks - for the government to be confident enough to make a public statement, because it will not want to risk getting any details wrong. But if suspicions about Russia are confirmed, then some kind of action seems inevitable. The legacy of the 2006 Litvinenko case shows that expelling diplomats alone may not be regarded as much of a deterrent to future acts. Economic sanctions on the Russian elite may have more bite, but would require greater political will. Mr Skripal, 66, was convicted of passing secrets to MI6 but was given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a \"spy swap\". It is known that he and his 33-year-old daughter had visited the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found collapsed on a bench near the Maltings shopping centre. A witness, who saw the pair at the restaurant, told the BBC Mr Skripal was acting \"very strange\" and was \"very agitated\". \"He seemed to lose his temper... and he just started screaming at the top of his voice, he wanted his bill and he wanted to go.\" Police have yet to say if they know how and where the poison was administered. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said Russia was becoming an \"ever greater threat\", amid speculation the attack could have some element of state involvement. \"Russia's being assertive, Russia's being more aggressive, and we have to change the way that we deal with it because we can't be in a situation in these areas of conflict where we are being pushed around by another nation,\" he told ITV's Good Morning Britain. Police said they wanted to speak to anyone who was in the centre of Salisbury on Sunday afternoon. They are particularly keen to hear from people who ate at Zizzi or drank in the Mill pub between 13:00 and 16:00 GMT. Both sites remain closed to the public. BBC correspondent Leila Nathoo said there had been \"a flurry of activity\" outside Mr Skripal's Salisbury home at lunchtime. She said ambulances and an incident response team were in attendance and a police tent had been erected outside the house. Part of a business park in nearby Amesbury also remains cordoned off. Speaking on Wednesday, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said: \"This is being treated as a major incident involving attempted murder, by administration of a nerve agent. He said Mr Skripal and his daughter were \"targeted specifically\". \"Our role now of course is to establish who is behind this and why they carried out this act,\" he added. Nerve agents are highly toxic chemicals that stop the nervous system working and shut down bodily functions. They normally enter the body through the mouth or nose, but can also be absorbed through the eyes or skin. Mr Rowley said there was no evidence of a widespread health risk to the public. Hundreds of detectives, forensic officers, analysts and intelligence officers are working on the case, which has drawn comparison with the killing of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko with radioactive polonium-210 in London in 2006. A public inquiry concluded his death was probably carried out with the approval of President Vladimir Putin. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs on Tuesday the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the Skripal case. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, but is open to co-operating with British police if requested. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said foreign media had used the case as part of an anti-Russian campaign. Who is Sergei Skripal?\nSergei Skripal is a retired Russian military intelligence colonel who was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Mr Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years. Do you have any information to share on this story?

        "content": "South Africa's Rivonia Trial, which saw Nelson Mandela and other anti-apartheid activists jailed, was a key moment in the country's struggle for freedom. Now, more than 50 years later, all of the roughly 300 hours of proceedings are available to listen to for the first time. The BBC's Gavin Fischer, who has a personal connection to the trial, looks at what the tapes can reveal. The Rivonia Trial, lasting from October 1963 to June 1964, has been well documented as a pivotal point in the fight against the white minority government in South Africa. It brought Nelson Mandela to the world stage. His famous speech from the dock, declaring that freedom and equality was \"an ideal for which I am prepared to die\", became a rallying cry for black people under the apartheid regime, and set the young lawyer on a path to become the country's first democratically elected president 30 years later. It could have been very different. Mandela and his co-accused faced the death penalty for acts of sabotage against the state. It was my great-uncle, Bram Fischer, who led their defence team, and was part of saving their lives. He took great risks in getting involved, as he was also an anti-apartheid activist who could himself have been in the dock at the Rivonia Trial. More myth than man to me\nIn fact, just a few years later, he too would be arrested and sentenced to life in prison. Seen as a traitor to his own white, Afrikaner people, he was badly mistreated and died while still in custody in 1975, before I was born. But by being given access to the newly digitised tapes from the Rivonia Trial, I have been able to go back to a time before tragedy overtook Bram's life. It's been my first chance to hear him speak. Polite to all he addresses, his calm tones are shot through with a seam of fierce authority. Eyes shut and headphones on, I listen. For the first time my great uncle, who has been more myth than man to me, starts to become real. The Rivonia Trial is itself now steeped in a kind of myth, part of the great story of South Africa's journey to freedom. The new recordings give the opportunity to hear some of the journey's most famous moments. There's the searing power of Mandela's speech, Walter Sisulu's impressive philosophical outwitting of the prosecutor, the defiant humour of Ahmed Kathrada and Denis Goldberg and Elias Motsoaledi's humble but striking detailing of the life of black people in South Africa: \"I did what I did because I wanted to help my people in the struggle for equal rights. I felt very strongly about the laws which discriminated against my people and which caused poverty, ill health and misery for which they suffer,\" he told the court. Immersing myself in the recordings, I've been able to forget the historical significance of these moments and simply be overawed by them. Not knowing what the future held, these men didn't beg for clemency or deny their actions, they used the trial to highlight the injustice being perpetrated by the government. To hear them speak is a privilege. I have also found myself getting lost in some of the trial's more mundane moments: the background chatter, the scraping of chairs, the thuds and silences as the recording equipment is adjusted. I revel in it all as the sounds swell and fall, pulling me back to that time. Then, from the midst of the crackle and hiss of the recordings, come moments of startling resonance I never knew existed and which are rarely documented in the story of the Rivonia Trial. Thomas Mashifane was a state witness, tortured into giving evidence against the accused. He had worked at a farm called Liliesleaf in Johannesburg, which Mandela and others had used as a hideout. He knew nothing of their activities, and his testimony is filled with innocuous detail, irrelevant to the case. Yet, at its end, he speaks up, unprompted, about being beaten and humiliated by the police. I can't breathe for the horror of it. I want to shrink from what white people did back then; but I also want to run over and hug him for forcing the court to hear what really happened. When I get to that moment, I have to take my headphones off, I just cannot sit in that courtroom any more. Weeks later, I meet Mr Mashifane's daughter Elizabeth. She's kind, though her manner is distant, hardened in preparation for reliving her father's ordeal. But as I play her the tape, this strength seems to drain away. It's the first time she has ever heard this testimony. \"It makes me feel like it happened yesterday,\" she tells me. As she listens, Elizabeth looks away from me, lost in her father's words. I try to fill the silence that follows, searching for something - anything - positive to say. I end up asking if she is proud of the fact that he spoke up. For a moment, her eyes turn back to me. \"But did it make any difference?\" she asks. No answer is necessary. Turning away again, she says more quietly: \"None of them were treated like humans.\" Thwadi Makena was also a labourer at Liliesleaf, and the only one left alive today. When I meet him, he strikes me as a quiet, humble man. On the tapes, he recounts being beaten by the apartheid police: \"They told me to undress, I did undress. They then were in a group\u2026 and told me to run round the table and each one I passed either kicked me or struck me with fists. \"My right ear is still suffering the effects, and my one front tooth in my top jaw is still loose. I just wanted to know why I was assaulted like that, when I was not committing any offence.\" Yet, as I play him the recording, Mr Makena's thin face comes alive and he chuckles with delight. \"I feel very excited to hear my voice after so many years. It's just so amazing - I can't believe it,\" he tells me. As with most of those I have spoken to, recalling details of the case turns Mr Makena's mood more sombre. He was held by police, made to feel like a criminal and says the impact it had remains to this day. \"I tend to feel they might come back and say some new information has been revealed and [I] need to come and make some confession,\" he says. \"That fear has always been there.\" Not an end, but a beginning\nWhile the recordings contain details which can bring back difficult memories, in playing them to those closest to the trial, I have found all have appreciated the chance to hear voices they thought lost forever. It is clear even short snippets of tape can help reclaim these stories from the dehumanising mass of the apartheid state. Laws may have changed since democracy was won, but grinding structural injustice remains a reality for so many South Africans. I too often lose these individuals' stories in an effort to find sense in the state of this country. The more tales of poverty I hear, the less I understand the cause or the solution. So these tapes have a lesson for me: don't become numb. Listening is at least a start. There is no chance to hear the verdicts of the trial. Those tapes haven't been found. Maybe we'll never hear the moments when the judge showed what little mercy he could find, in the law and in himself, sentencing all the accused to life in prison. Life, not death. Not an end, but a beginning. Maybe even the beginning of a new chapter in the country's history. But as the audio plays, that story is still in the future. The tapes fuzz and hiss and you can sense the tension of what might come to pass. In these moments, the Rivonia Trial feels not so much of the past, but of the present. As I listen, my great uncle is still alive and the people around me suffer, fight and survive, not knowing what their future holds. ",

        "content": "A man has pleaded not guilty to stealing actress Frances McDormand's Oscar after Sunday's ceremony. McDormand was named best actress - but her statuette briefly went missing at the lavish after-show Governor's Ball. Terry Bryant filmed himself holding a statuette and telling other guests he was a winner, before being arrested. His lawyer Daniel Brookman said: \"There's a difference between holding an Oscar and what he is charged with, so that will play out in court.\" The 47-year-old had been in police custody on a grand theft charge, but was released without having to pay bail following Wednesday's hearing after the judge ruled he did not pose a flight risk. Judge Deborah Brazil heard testimony from his rabbi Naomi Levy, who described him as a \"sweet, gentle man of faith\". Ms Levy added: \"I think we are living in an unusual time in America. I believe that maybe perhaps his story is a commentary on our whole society and its obsession with its 15 minutes of fame.\" Police said Mr Bryant was a ticket holder for the Governor's Ball. He was ordered to return to court on 28 March. Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said he faces up to three years in jail if convicted. The Oscar was retrieved and later returned to McDormand, who won for her role in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. It's the actress's second Oscar, 21 years after her first for Fargo.

The firm has been hit by a slowdown in the housing market as well as the rise of online agents such as Purplebricks. But early afternoon the shares had pulled back to stand at about 6% down. The profit figures were also dragged lower by one-off costs as Countrywide continued to restructure the business. But even with these are stripped out, pre-tax profits more than halved to \u00a325.2m, from \u00a352.7m in 2016. Countrywide, which called 2017 \"a disappointing year\", said trading had remained under pressure since the start of 2018 with a pipeline of work \"significantly\" below a year earlier. Cost-cutting drive\nIts previous chief executive, Alison Platt, left last month after a profit warning and announcement of a further restructuring of the business which included investment in digital operations to compete with online rivals. Countrywide said on Thursday that it was shedding about 150 of its 450-strong head office team as part of a cost-cutting drive. The firm employs about 8,000 nationwide. The results announcement laid bare the problems in its core sales and lettings arm, where earnings sank 47% to \u00a314.9m. Across sales and lettings in London, earnings fell 44% to \u00a311.5m. Executive chairman Peter Long admitted that the patience of investors had been \"sorely tested\". The company will not be paying a dividend to shareholders. He said the group was working to resolve poor performance in sales and lettings, but admitted it would \"take time\". \"We believe these business units are fixable, know what we have to do to restore them and the steps to take that should result in a return to profitable growth.\" Some of the problems facing the housing sector were underlined on Thursday with news that the number of homes on estate agents' books had dwindled to a new low. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said average property stock levels per branch on agents' books fell to a new record low of just under 42, as inquiries from new buyers, new instructions from sellers and newly-agreed sales continued to drift lower in February. New buyer inquiries fell for the 11th month in a row, while sales trends have remained similar over the past six months, Rics said. Where can you afford to live?

        "content": "Bonuses for 84,000 staff at John Lewis and Waitrose have been cut for the fifth year in a row. Employees will get a 5% bonus, down from 6% last year and the lowest since the 4% paid out in 1954. Annual group profit, before the partnership bonus, tax and exceptional items, fell 21.9% to \u00a3289.2m. John Lewis Partnership chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield said 2017 had been a \"challenging year\", as expected, with \"subdued\" consumer demand. He said weakness in sterling had led to higher costs, putting pressure on the business's profit margin. The partnership said it had been hit by exceptional costs of \u00a3111.3m, including \u00a372.8m on restructuring and redundancy costs, principally in relation to brand, distribution and retail operations. \"This was why we chose to reduce the proportion of profits paid as partnership bonus last year so as to absorb these impacts while continuing to invest in the future and in strengthening our balance sheet,\" Sir Charlie said. He said the firm remained committed to increasing pay rates for non-management staff, and that the average hourly rate of pay for a non-management workers was \u00a38.91. 'Volatile' year ahead\nLike-for-like sales - which strip out the impact of store openings - at the John Lewis department stores were up 0.4%. At Waitrose, sales returned to growth, with like-for-like sales rising 0.9%. Gross sales for the full-year period were up 2% at \u00a311.6bn. \"We expect trading to be volatile in 2018-19, with continuing economic uncertainty and no let up in competitive intensity. We therefore anticipate further pressure on profits,\" the company said. Redundancy payments cost it \u00a372.8m in 2017. The partnership said 1,440 members of staff had left the business through redundancy in the past year. Analysis: Emma Simpson, BBC business correspondent\nJohn Lewis is owned by its staff and they cherish their annual bonus. It's down for the fifth year in a row but given the challenging conditions on the High Street right now, some partners may be feeling grateful for any extra payout. John Lewis continues to be one of the stronger players. Today's figures show even this household name isn't immune from the forces buffeting the industry. It warned back in January 2017 that it would reduce the bonus in order to prepare for tougher trading conditions ahead. That looks to have been a prudent move. But the relentless pressure on profits shows no sign of easing this year, either. 'Tricky conditions'\nThe company said that its John Lewis stores had increased market share in fashion, homewares, electrical goods and home technology, with sales in the latter category up by 2.6%. Fashion sales climbed 3.2%, boosted by a strong performance in womenswear, up 5.0%. Sales of its own-brand womenswear rose 14.9%. But homeware sales were down 0.8%, with soft demand in categories such as fitted furniture, fitted flooring and upholstery. \"These results show that conditions of the High Street are very tricky at the moment,\" said Richard Lim, chief executive of analysts Retail Economics. \"Consumer spending generally is a lot softer, while inflation is still near a five-year high.\" He said research by his firm showed that consumers were also worried about Brexit and their own low levels of personal savings. \"People's personal finances are under pressure.\" Mr Lim said that in the year ahead John Lewis would be looking very closely at its costs and at ways of potentially bringing these down. \"That could mean looking at using their existing spaces more efficiently and innovatively.\" How does the John Lewis Partnership work?\n",

        "content": "The attempted murder of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, using a nerve agent was a \"brazen and reckless attack\", Amber Rudd has said. Mr Skripal and his daughter are still critically ill after being found collapsed on a bench in Salisbury city centre on Sunday. Counter-terrorism officers are working to find the origin of the nerve agent. A police officer, who was in intensive care, is now \"stable and conscious\", Wiltshire's chief constable said. Addressing the House of Commons, the home secretary said the attack was \"attempted murder in the most cruel and public way\". Ms Rudd told MPs it was an \"outrageous crime\", adding that the government would \"act without hesitation as the facts become clearer\". She refused to speculate on whether the Russian state might have been involved in the attack, saying the police investigation should be based on \"facts, not rumour\". However, she said the government was committed to bringing the perpetrators to justice \"whoever they are and wherever they may be\". Prime Minister Theresa May told ITV News that \"if action needs to be taken then the government will do that\". \"We will do what is appropriate, we will do what is right, if it is proved to be the case that this is state-sponsored,\" she said. Earlier, Ms Rudd said the nerve agent used in the poisoning was \"very rare\". Responding to the home secretary's speech, the UK's Russian embassy Tweeted that it \"totally\" agreed with her vow to first establish evidence and then publish official conclusions. MFA: when Boris Berezovsky and Alexander Perepilichny died in Britain, there was a lot of speculation in the media, then all the conclusions were classified, and no data provided to Russia. Same happening now, with MI6 agent Sergei Skripal poisoning pic.twitter.com/x7cdTQRpZQ End of Twitter post by @RussianEmbassy Police said government scientists had identified the nerve agent used, but would not make that information public at this stage. The source familiar with the investigation told the BBC it was likely to be rarer than the Sarin gas thought to have been used in Syria and in an attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995. And it was said not to be VX - the nerve agent used to kill the half brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Malaysia last year. Analysis\nBy Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent The fact the nerve agent is \"very rare\" will help the investigation narrow its focus. Making nerve agents and delivering them requires considerable infrastructure and the more unusual the agent the easier it will be to locate which country, even which laboratory, might be involved. That combined with police leads on who delivered the agent will form the basis for a determination of responsibility, along with any other intelligence that can be gathered. It may take days - even weeks - for the government to be confident enough to make a public statement, because it will not want to risk getting any details wrong. But if suspicions about Russia are confirmed, then some kind of action seems inevitable. The legacy of the 2006 Litvinenko case shows that expelling diplomats alone may not be regarded as much of a deterrent to future acts. Economic sanctions on the Russian elite may have more bite, but would require greater political will. Mr Skripal, 66, was convicted of passing secrets to MI6 but was given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a \"spy swap\". It is known that he and his 33-year-old daughter had visited the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found collapsed on a bench near the Maltings shopping centre. A witness, who saw the pair at the restaurant, told the BBC Mr Skripal was acting \"very strange\" and was \"very agitated\". \"He seemed to lose his temper... and he just started screaming at the top of his voice, he wanted his bill and he wanted to go.\" Police have yet to say if they know how and where the poison was administered. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said Russia was becoming an \"ever greater threat\", amid speculation the attack could have some element of state involvement. \"Russia's being assertive, Russia's being more aggressive, and we have to change the way that we deal with it because we can't be in a situation in these areas of conflict where we are being pushed around by another nation,\" he told ITV's Good Morning Britain. Police said they wanted to speak to anyone who was in the centre of Salisbury on Sunday afternoon. They are particularly keen to hear from people who ate at Zizzi or drank in the Mill pub between 13:00 and 16:00 GMT. Both sites remain closed to the public. BBC correspondent Leila Nathoo said there had been \"a flurry of activity\" outside Mr Skripal's Salisbury home at lunchtime. She said ambulances and an incident response team were in attendance and a police tent had been erected outside the house. Part of a business park in nearby Amesbury also remains cordoned off, while the graves of Mr Skripal's wife and son at a Salisbury cemetery have also been taped off by police. Speaking on Wednesday, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said: \"This is being treated as a major incident involving attempted murder, by administration of a nerve agent. He said Mr Skripal and his daughter were \"targeted specifically\". \"Our role now of course is to establish who is behind this and why they carried out this act,\" he added. Nerve agents are highly toxic chemicals that stop the nervous system working and shut down bodily functions. They normally enter the body through the mouth or nose, but can also be absorbed through the eyes or skin. Mr Rowley said there was no evidence of a widespread health risk to the public. Hundreds of detectives, forensic officers, analysts and intelligence officers are working on the case, which has drawn comparison with the killing of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko with radioactive polonium-210 in London in 2006. A public inquiry concluded his death was probably carried out with the approval of President Vladimir Putin. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs on Tuesday the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the Skripal case. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, but is open to co-operating with British police if requested. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said foreign media had used the case as part of an anti-Russian campaign. Who is Sergei Skripal?\nSergei Skripal is a retired Russian military intelligence colonel who was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Mr Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years. Do you have any information to share on this story?

The man, an Afghan national, has denied a political motive for the attacks. Three members of the same family were hurt in the first attack at Nestroyplatz at 19:45 (18:45 GMT) and an unrelated man, 20, was stabbed nearby around half an hour later. The suspect reportedly told police he had been in a \"bad, aggressive mood\". The 23-year-old said he had attacked the family - parents and a teenage daughter - because he was angry about his situation in life, Vienna police said in a statement (in German). He said he had attacked the 20-year-old man, an acquaintance, because he held him responsible for his past drug addiction, the police added. The fourth victim is a fellow Afghan national, local media report. Earlier reports had said he was from Chechnya. The father of the family, who is 67, remains in a critical condition in hospital. The lives of the mother, 56, and 17-year-old daughter, as well as the 20-year-old unrelated victim, are now out of danger. The suspect categorically denied a political motivation when questioned, police said. ",

        "content": "A witness to the Parsons Green bombing told the Old Bailey how his head was \"engulfed in flames\" during the attack. Stephen Nash was on the District Line underground train on 15 September 2017 when the device went off. CCTV allegedly shows Ahmed Hassan - who prosecutors said built the bomb and set the timer - leaving the train one stop earlier at Putney Bridge station, having left a bag behind. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life, The CCTV footage then showed the moment an orange fireball filled the carriage. Prosecutor Alison Morgan has said experts concluded it was simply \"luck\" that the bomb did not fully detonate. Mr Hassan was arrested at the Port of Dover the day after the attack. 'A blinding flash'\nMr Nash told the court he was was reading a newspaper, \"oblivious\" to what was going on, when the explosion happened. He said: \"At Parsons Green there was a loud bang. There was a blinding flash to my left and I was engulfed in flames. \"I was thrown to the ground. The flames were overwhelming.\" He described an \"intense heat\", before adding: \"I thought I had lost my ears. I thought my head was on fire.\" Mr Nash said he was knocked out, and when he woke up a few seconds later, he was the last person on the train. \"I called out to the Tube,\" he said. \"Just as I got to the doors, the doors started to close. \"It was a little bit scary and I called out on to the platform.\" He was taken to an emergency triage centre in a local pub and has been treated by a plastic surgeon for severe burns to his head and ears. 'Slow motion'\nMr Nash was among a number of witnesses giving evidence at the trial. The court heard that many of the 93 people caught in the bombing suffered burns or were crushed in the stampede to get out. Retired counter-terrorism officer Alex Beavan had boarded the train at Wimbledon and was standing near the doors when the bomb went off. \"I heard a huge popping sound,\" he said. \"Looking towards the direction of the sound, I saw a rolling fireball coming over the ceiling at the back of the train. \"I saw the rolling fireball, wall to wall, slowly coming up the ceiling. He added: \"Everything goes in slow motion. There was a woman. I could see her realise what was happening and she began screaming and some men were shouting 'run'. \"There was chaos and I was thinking there is going to be a second attack, so I ran across the platform.\" Aimee Colville, who got on the train at Parsons Green moments before the explosion, said she saw a \"wall of glass\" coming towards her. She said: \"I don't know if I physically got myself down or if I blacked out, but at that point I noticed a flame come over my right side. \"That morning I had curled my hair and I had put hairspray in my hair, so when the flames came over me my hair immediately caught fire.\" Lucinda Glazebrook, who also boarded the train at Parsons Green, told the court she felt the heat from the fireball on her face. \"I kept touching my face and feeling the back of my hair and my hair was coming out in chunks,\" she said. 'Wall of faces'\nAn army officer travelling on the train turned towards the explosion because of his \"instinct\" and training. Craig Palmer told the court that he wanted to know what had happened so began walking towards where the device had partly detonated. He said: \"I was conscious that there was probably a couple of people that rushed past me, and I had a seen the wall of faces in terror who rushed past me. \"There was personal debris, bags, shoes, all this sort of stuff. I could see something in the corner of the train, it was burning. He added: \"There was smoke billowing out of it and the carriage was filling up with grey smoke. \"I could smell, at that point, something I categorise as being explosives.\" Mr Palmer said he expected to see a \"suicide bomber\" but he discovered the bomb, which he believed to be an \"improvised explosive device\". He then took photos of it to share with special officers who arrived at the scene. Journey before attack\nA number of other videos allegedly showing Mr Hassan's movements on the day of the attack have been shown to the jury by prosecutors. The first video is said by prosecutors to show him leaving his foster home in Sunbury, Surrey, carrying a plastic bag, which they told the court contained the device that exploded on the underground train. A second then allegedly shows Mr Hassan catching a train to Wimbledon. And CCTV from the platform allegedly shows him going into the station toilets - where prosecutors said he set the timer on the device - and emerging 13 minutes later carrying the bag and heading towards the District Line platforms. Further footage was also shown, which prosecutors said showed Mr Hassan from a day before the attack going to two supermarkets - an Asda and an Aldi in Feltham - buying matches, batteries, a screw driver and screw driver bit sets, allegedly used to construct the device. UK arrival\nJurors were told on Wednesday that Mr Hassan had arrived in Britain in the back of a lorry via the Channel Tunnel in October 2015. He told authorities he was born in June 1999 in Iraq, but had no identity documents. He gave his name as Ahmed Hassan Mohammed Ali. He claimed asylum, and from 2016 lived with foster parents in Cavendish Road, Sunbury. At the time he allegedly planned his attack, his asylum claim was still outstanding, the court heard. The trial continues. ",

        "content": "Freezing temperatures will lead to more potholes on UK roads, as snow and ice break up road surfaces, says the RAC. Between Sunday and Tuesday, the RAC received 218 calls for breakdowns relating to potholes, compared with 104 between February and March. It says the extreme cold weather has caused freezing water to get into cracks on already bad road surfaces. The Department for Transport said it was investing \u00a323bn on roads in England. Local councils fix a pothole every 19 seconds, according to the Local Government Association. Driving into them can break suspension springs, damage shock absorbers and distort wheels. Parts of Wales and Yorkshire are facing fresh snowfall as schools are closed, flights are disrupted and drivers advised not to travel. The RAC said after-effects from the cold snap could last for years to come as conditions \"wreak havoc\" on the roads. \"Our roads were already in a poor state of repair before the extreme cold weather hit,\" a spokesperson said \"We fear this spring may see the emergence of almost as many potholes as daffodils.\" Meanwhile, charity Cycling UK has warned potholes pose a high risk of personal injury or in the worst cases, death. A Department for Transport spokesman said it was investing a \"record\" \u00a323bn on roads. \"We know road surfaces are a concern for all road users and that is why we are providing local highway authorities in England, with just under \u00a36bn to help improve the condition of our local highway networks. \"We are also giving local authorities a record \u00a3296m through the pothole action fund - that's enough to fix just under six million potholes.\" In Scotland, local authorities were given \u00a310.4bn this year and the Scottish government says it is up to them to manage their own budgets. A spokeswoman said the government has said it is open to discussions about the costs linked to the severe weather.

        "content": "Labour has accused the government of prioritising financial services over manufacturing in Brexit trade talks. Discussions over the UK's post-Brexit trading framework with the EU are expected to begin later this year. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said it was clear the government aimed to \"win a deal for financial services first and then worry about the rest of the economy later\". The chancellor has argued for a post-Brexit deal to include banking. On Wednesday, Philip Hammond said: \"A trade deal will only happen if it is fair and balances the interests of both sides. \"Given the shape of the British economy, and our trade balance with the EU27, it is hard to see how any deal that did not include services could look like a fair and balanced settlement.\" John McDonnell said that showed the government was favouring financial services, such as banking and trading, over other parts of the economy. Speaking to the British Chambers of Commerce's (BCC) annual conference in London, Mr McDonnell said: \"There is no other reason to raise a specific deal for financial services, even if it is as bad and fantastical as proposed, while just last week refusing to negotiate a new customs union that would protect our manufacturing trade.\" Goods v services\nLabour has said the inclusion of financial services in a trade deal is a \"red line\" for Labour, so the criticism appears to be one of emphasis. Financial services are important to the UK - the sector employs more than two million people and paid \u00a335bn in tax last year, according to lobby group The City UK and accountancy giant PwC. But when it comes to trade with the EU, the picture is less clear cut. The UK sells more financial services to the rest of the EU than it buys. Exports were worth \u00a327bn in 2016, according to the Office for National Statistics. So it's big, but it's not as large as goods sales to the EU. They were worth much more, at \u00a3145bn. However, we buy more products from the EU than we sell there. Britain's exports of services to the EU have grown in recent years, whereas sales of products have fallen. At the moment, this discussion is moot. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has resisted the inclusion of banking in a post-Brexit arrangement, saying a trade deal including financial services \"does not exist\". The International Trade Secretary, Liam Fox, told the BCC's conference the UK should not be penalised for leaving the EU. \"The idea of punishing Britain to me is not the language of a club, it is the language of a gang,\" he said.

        "content": "The attempted murder of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, using a nerve agent was a \"brazen and reckless attack\", Amber Rudd has said. Mr Skripal and his daughter are still critically ill after being found collapsed on a bench in Salisbury city centre on Sunday. Counter-terrorism officers are working to find the origin of the nerve agent. A police officer, who was in intensive care, is now \"stable and conscious\", Wiltshire's chief constable said. Addressing the House of Commons, the home secretary said the attack was \"attempted murder in the most cruel and public way\". Ms Rudd told MPs it was an \"outrageous crime\", adding that the government would \"act without hesitation as the facts become clearer\". She refused to speculate on whether the Russian state might have been involved in the attack, saying the police investigation should be based on \"facts, not rumour\". However, she said the government was committed to bringing the perpetrators to justice \"whoever they are and wherever they may be\". Prime Minister Theresa May told ITV News that \"if action needs to be taken then the government will do that\". \"We will do what is appropriate, we will do what is right, if it is proved to be the case that this is state-sponsored,\" she said. Earlier, Ms Rudd said the nerve agent used in the poisoning was \"very rare\". Responding to the home secretary's speech, the UK's Russian embassy Tweeted that it \"totally\" agreed with her vow to first establish evidence and then publish official conclusions. MFA: when Boris Berezovsky and Alexander Perepilichny died in Britain, there was a lot of speculation in the media, then all the conclusions were classified, and no data provided to Russia. Same happening now, with MI6 agent Sergei Skripal poisoning pic.twitter.com/x7cdTQRpZQ End of Twitter post by @RussianEmbassy Police said government scientists had identified the nerve agent used, but would not make that information public at this stage. The source familiar with the investigation told the BBC it was likely to be rarer than the Sarin gas thought to have been used in Syria and in an attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995. And it was said not to be VX - the nerve agent used to kill the half brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Malaysia last year. Analysis\nBy Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent The fact the nerve agent is \"very rare\" will help the investigation narrow its focus. Making nerve agents and delivering them requires considerable infrastructure and the more unusual the agent the easier it will be to locate which country, even which laboratory, might be involved. That combined with police leads on who delivered the agent will form the basis for a determination of responsibility, along with any other intelligence that can be gathered. It may take days - even weeks - for the government to be confident enough to make a public statement, because it will not want to risk getting any details wrong. But if suspicions about Russia are confirmed, then some kind of action seems inevitable. The legacy of the 2006 Litvinenko case shows that expelling diplomats alone may not be regarded as much of a deterrent to future acts. Economic sanctions on the Russian elite may have more bite, but would require greater political will. Mr Skripal, 66, was convicted of passing secrets to MI6 but was given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a \"spy swap\". It is known that he and his 33-year-old daughter had visited the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found collapsed on a bench near the Maltings shopping centre. A witness, who saw the pair at the restaurant, told the BBC Mr Skripal was acting \"very strange\" and was \"very agitated\". \"He seemed to lose his temper... and he just started screaming at the top of his voice, he wanted his bill and he wanted to go.\" Police have yet to say if they know how and where the poison was administered. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said Russia was becoming an \"ever greater threat\", amid speculation the attack could have some element of state involvement. \"Russia's being assertive, Russia's being more aggressive, and we have to change the way that we deal with it because we can't be in a situation in these areas of conflict where we are being pushed around by another nation,\" he told ITV's Good Morning Britain. Police said they wanted to speak to anyone who was in the centre of Salisbury on Sunday afternoon. They are particularly keen to hear from people who ate at Zizzi or drank in the Mill pub between 13:00 and 16:00 GMT. Both sites remain closed to the public. BBC correspondent Leila Nathoo said there had been \"a flurry of activity\" outside Mr Skripal's Salisbury home at lunchtime. She said ambulances and an incident response team were in attendance and a police tent had been erected outside the house. Part of a business park in nearby Amesbury also remains cordoned off, while the graves of Mr Skripal's wife and son at a Salisbury cemetery have also been taped off by police. Speaking on Wednesday, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said: \"This is being treated as a major incident involving attempted murder, by administration of a nerve agent. He said Mr Skripal and his daughter were \"targeted specifically\". \"Our role now of course is to establish who is behind this and why they carried out this act,\" he added. Nerve agents are highly toxic chemicals that stop the nervous system working and shut down bodily functions. They normally enter the body through the mouth or nose, but can also be absorbed through the eyes or skin. Mr Rowley said there was no evidence of a widespread health risk to the public. Hundreds of detectives, forensic officers, analysts and intelligence officers are working on the case, which has drawn comparison with the killing of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko with radioactive polonium-210 in London in 2006. A public inquiry concluded his death was probably carried out with the approval of President Vladimir Putin. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs on Tuesday the UK would respond \"robustly\" to any evidence of Russian \"state responsibility\" in the Skripal case. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, but is open to co-operating with British police if requested. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said foreign media had used the case as part of an anti-Russian campaign. Who is Sergei Skripal?\nSergei Skripal is a retired Russian military intelligence colonel who was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Mr Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years. Do you have any information to share on this story?

        "content": "Thousands of fans and representatives of every Serie A club have gathered in Florence for the funeral of Fiorentina captain Davide Astori. The Italy international defender died at the age of 31 on Saturday after a sudden illness. Members of the Juventus squad that beat Tottenham on Wednesday night were in attendance, including Italy's national team captain Gianluigi Buffon. Astori will be buried in Bergamo, where he grew up and his parents still live. Astori leaves a wife and a two-year-old daughter. Audio of the service was broadcast to the thousands outside the church, many of whom were in tears. \"He has always been and will always be a Florentine,\" said the city's archbishop, Cardinal Giuseppe Betori. The crowd chanted \"There's only one captain\" as Astori was carried out of the church after the service. Florence's city government declared Thursday a day of mourning, with schools and businesses asked to observe one minute's silence at 12:00 GMT. Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini, who was in tears during a minute's silence for Astori at Wembley on Wednesday night, was in attendance along with team-mates and manager Massimiliano Allegri. Speaking after Juve's Champions League victory, Chiellini said: \"We dedicate the win to him. He is on our minds on this day. \"I cried many times. He was a fantastic player. It was very difficult during the match because we had to think of the game and the outcome, and it's not easy. But he's always in our heart,\" Another of Astori's former sides, AC Milan, are in action later on Thursday when they host Arsenal in the Europa League. ",

        "content": "Shares in Countrywide, the UK's largest estate agent group, lost 20% after it warned of tough times in the market. Countrywide, whose brands include Bairstow Eves and Gascoigne Pees, made a \u00a3208.1m after-tax loss in 2017, versus a \u00a317.5m profit in 2016. said about 150 head office jobs would go. The firm has been hit by a slowdown in the housing market as well as the rise of online agents such as Purplebricks. But by mid afternoon the shares had pulled back to stand at about 8% down. The profit figures were also dragged lower by one-off costs as Countrywide continued to restructure the business. But even with these are stripped out, pre-tax profits more than halved to \u00a325.2m, from \u00a352.7m in 2016. Countrywide, which called 2017 \"a disappointing year\", said trading had remained under pressure since the start of 2018 with a pipeline of work \"significantly\" below a year earlier. Cost-cutting drive\nIts previous chief executive, Alison Platt, left last month after a profit warning and announcement of a further restructuring of the business which included investment in digital operations to compete with online rivals. Countrywide said on Thursday that it was shedding about 150 of its 450-strong head office team as part of a cost-cutting drive. The firm employs about 8,000 nationwide. The results announcement laid bare the problems in its core sales and lettings arm, where earnings sank 47% to \u00a314.9m. Across sales and lettings in London, earnings fell 44% to \u00a311.5m. Executive chairman Peter Long admitted that the patience of investors had been \"sorely tested\". The company will not be paying a dividend to shareholders. He said the group was working to resolve poor performance in sales and lettings, but admitted it would \"take time\". \"We believe these business units are fixable, know what we have to do to restore them and the steps to take that should result in a return to profitable growth.\" Some of the problems facing the housing sector were underlined on Thursday with news that the number of homes on estate agents' books had dwindled to a new low. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said average property stock levels per branch on agents' books fell to a new record low of just under 42, as inquiries from new buyers, new instructions from sellers and newly-agreed sales continued to drift lower in February. New buyer inquiries fell for the 11th month in a row, while sales trends have remained similar over the past six months, Rics said. Where can you afford to live?

        "content": "A witness to the Parsons Green bombing told the Old Bailey how his head was \"engulfed in flames\" during the attack. Stephen Nash was on the District Line underground train on 15 September 2017 when the device went off. CCTV allegedly shows Ahmed Hassan - who prosecutors said built the bomb and set the timer - leaving the train one stop earlier at Putney Bridge station, having left a bag behind. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life, The CCTV footage then showed the moment an orange fireball filled the carriage. Prosecutor Alison Morgan has said experts concluded it was simply \"luck\" that the bomb did not fully detonate. Mr Hassan was arrested at the Port of Dover the day after the attack. 'A blinding flash'\nMr Nash told the court he was was reading a newspaper, \"oblivious\" to what was going on, when the explosion happened. He said: \"At Parsons Green there was a loud bang. There was a blinding flash to my left and I was engulfed in flames.\" He described an \"intense heat\", before adding: \"I thought I had lost my ears. I thought my head was on fire.\" Mr Nash said he was knocked out, and when he woke up a few seconds later, he was the last person on the train. \"I called out to the Tube,\" he said. \"Just as I got to the doors, the doors started to close. \"It was a little bit scary and I called out on to the platform.\" 'Slow motion'\nMr Nash was among a number of witnesses giving evidence at the trial. The court heard that many of the 93 people caught in the bombing suffered burns or were crushed in the stampede to get out. Retired counter-terrorism officer Alex Beavan had boarded the train at Wimbledon and was standing near the doors when the bomb went off. \"I heard a huge popping sound,\" he said. \"Looking towards the direction of the sound, I saw a rolling fireball coming over the ceiling at the back of the train. \"I saw the rolling fireball, wall to wall, slowly coming up the ceiling.\" He added: \"Everything goes in slow motion. There was chaos and I was thinking there is going to be a second attack, so I ran across the platform.\" Aimee Colville, who got on the train at Parsons Green moments before the explosion, said she saw a \"wall of glass\" and flames coming towards her. She said: \"That morning I had curled my hair and I had put hairspray in my hair, so when the flames came over me my hair immediately caught fire.\" Lucinda Glazebrook, who also boarded the train at Parsons Green, told the court she felt the heat from the fireball on her face. \"I kept touching my face and feeling the back of my hair and my hair was coming out in chunks,\" she said. 'Wall of faces'\nAn army officer travelling on the train turned towards the explosion because of his \"instinct\" and training. Craig Palmer told the court that he wanted to know what had happened so began walking towards where the device had partly detonated. He said: \"I had a seen the wall of faces in terror who rushed past me. \"I could see something in the corner of the train, it was burning. He added: \"There was smoke billowing out of it and the carriage was filling up with grey smoke. \"I could smell, at that point, something I categorise as being explosives.\" Mr Palmer said he expected to see a \"suicide bomber\" but he discovered the bomb, which he believed to be an \"improvised explosive device\". He then took photos of it to share with special officers who arrived at the scene. Journey before attack\nA number of other videos allegedly showing Mr Hassan's movements on the day of the attack have been shown to the jury by prosecutors. The first video is said by prosecutors to show him leaving his foster home in Sunbury, Surrey, carrying a plastic bag, which they told the court contained the device that exploded on the underground train. A second then allegedly shows Mr Hassan catching a train to Wimbledon. And CCTV from the platform allegedly shows him going into the station toilets - where prosecutors said he set the timer on the device - and emerging 13 minutes later carrying the bag and heading towards the District Line platforms. Further footage was also shown, which prosecutors said showed Mr Hassan from a day before the attack going to two supermarkets - an Asda and an Aldi in Feltham - buying matches, batteries, a screw driver and screw driver bit sets, allegedly used to construct the device. Jurors were also shown a replica of the home-made bomb without the explosive, which was held in a Lidl frozen goods bag and contained 2.2kg of shrapnel. The court was told that Mr Hassan's fingerprints were found on the Tube carriage, on a white plastic bucket inside the bag, and on a pair of trousers covering the bucket. His DNA was also found at the scene. Giving evidence, explosives officer Andrew Gee said a test carried out to identify the explosive used was an \"87% hit\" for the chemical compound TATP. 'Trained to kill'\nOn Wednesday, the prosecution said that Mr Hassan had told Home Office officials, 20 months before the Parsons Green attack. that he had been \"trained to kill\" Ms Morgan said he was interviewed in Croydon in January 2016 where he is alleged to have told them he had been taken by force by Isis (the Islamic State group), who had threatened to kill his uncle and brother if he resisted. The court also heard he had arrived in Britain in the back of a lorry via the Channel Tunnel in October 2015. He claimed asylum, and from 2016 lived with foster parents in Cavendish Road, Sunbury, but his asylum claim was still outstanding as he planned the attack. The trial continues. ",

        "content": "Women earn 43% less than men on average at accountancy firm Deloitte, updated figures have shown. The figure takes into account the earnings of those at the top of the business - the partners - who are predominantly male. The accountancy giant says it pays men and women equally in equal roles. All firms with more than 250 employees are required to report gender pay gap figures by 4 April. But government guidelines say that partners in firms, which include accountancy and law firms, do not have to be included in this data. This is because partners take a share of the profits rather than being directly paid by the companies. Deloitte is the second of the big four accountancy firms to report updated figures. EY was the first of the big four to publish figures which took the earnings of its partners into account. 'Loophole' objection\nDeloitte said that its mean average pay gap was 43.2%, up from 18.2% figure it reported in July. But its median pay gap figure was 15.2%, down from 15.3% in October. The jump in the mean figure is due to the addition of a relatively small number of very highly paid partners, which does not affect the median measure. At Deloitte, 19% of the partners are women. The firm is trying to push this figure up to 25% by 2020. Big accountancy and law firms have been under political pressure to publish updated figures. This week, the chair of the Treasury Committee, Nicky Morgan, objected to firms using the \"loophole\" of not reporting the earnings of partners. However, big accountancy firms say they have started including partner earnings voluntarily in gender pay reporting. David Sproul, senior partner and chief executive of Deloitte UK, said: \"Our role in society means we have a responsibility to lead on critical issues such as inclusion and diversity. \"Going forward, we commit not only to publishing the data required by the gender pay legislation, but also to publishing our gender earnings gap on an annual basis.\" 'Action, not audits'\nWhen EY included partners in its calculations, its mean pay gap rose to 38.1%, and its median to 19.5%. That was up from the mean of 19.7% and median of 14.8% when it published figures in October. A spokeswoman for PwC said that it would be publishing its pay gap figures to include partners \"within the next few days\". KPMG said it would also update its data to include partner earnings. \"We take this issue very seriously and are in the process of finalising our pay gap data. We will publish that information shortly,\" the KPMG spokesperson said. Labour said it would force firms to take action to close gender pay gaps. Dawn Butler, Labour's shadow minister for women and equalities, said: \"It's time to close the gender pay gap once and for all. But to address these deep rooted inequalities, we need action, not just audits. \"The next Labour government will require all large employers to prove how they plan to tackle their gender pay gaps and prove they are equal pay employers.\" In February, Barclays said its investment bank had a mean gender pay gap of 48% and a median gap of 43.5%, while its retail bank had a mean gap of 26% and a median gap of 14.2%.

        "content": "Danish inventor Peter Madsen has denied murdering Swedish journalist Kim Wall on his homemade submarine, saying she died in an accident. At his trial in Copenhagen, Mr Madsen said the 30-year-old died of carbon monoxide poisoning when the vessel filled with toxic exhaust fumes. But he has admitted dismembering Ms Wall's body and disposing of it at sea. When asked why he did so, he told the court: \"I don't see how that mattered at that time, as she was dead.\" Ms Wall's remains were found by a passing cyclist, 11 days after she interviewed the inventor last August. Mr Madsen is charged with murder, dismemberment and aggravated sexual assault. He faces a life sentence if convicted, which typically means 15 to 17 years in prison without parole. Around 40 witnesses are set to give evidence, as prosecutors attempt to shed light on the circumstances of Ms Wall's death. What do we know about what happened?\nKim Wall, a freelance journalist, boarded Peter Madsen's UC3 Nautilus on the evening of 10 August 2017 to interview him for a story. She had left her boyfriend at a going-away party the couple were having ahead of a planned move to Beijing. When she did not return, her boyfriend alerted the police. Peter Madsen was rescued the next morning as his vessel was sinking. He initially told police that he had dropped off the reporter before the vessel began to go down. But he later said she died when a heavy hatch on the submarine fell on her head. Eleven days later, a cyclist found the remains of the journalist's headless torso on a nearby beach. Weeks later, police divers discovered other parts of her body in plastic bags weighed down with metal. The 47-year-old Dane - the skipper and designer of the Nautilus, a 17m- (56ft) long privately-owned submarine - changed his version of events several times. After saying a hatch fell on her head, he maintained instead that she had been killed by carbon monoxide poisoning inside the submarine while he was up on deck. He initially denied cutting up her body, but then admitted dismembering it and dumping the body parts in the sea. What was said in court?\nPeter Madsen appeared calm on Thursday, wearing a black T-shirt, jeans and black glasses. Members of the Wall family were also in the session. His lawyer Betina Hald Engmark told the court he denied murder but admitted \"violating the law about indecent handling of a corpse\". Explaining his version of events, Mr Madsen said the air pressure on board his submarine suddenly dropped while he was standing on the deck and Ms Wall was in the engine room. He said the vessel began to fill with exhaust fumes but he was unable to open the hatch and enter. \"When I finally manage to open the hatch, a warm cloud hits my face. I find her lifeless on the floor, and I squat next to her and try to wake her up, slapping her cheeks,\" he said. Asked why he had changed his story several times, Mr Madsen said that he had \"wanted to spare her family\" the \"gruesome details.\" Unclear answers\nMaddy Savage, BBC News, Copenhagen This is a high-profile trial being covered by more than 100 journalists from around the world, with some queuing for hours in the snow to secure a good view from the court or the press room, where reporters are asked to remain silent and banned from making phone calls. During breaks, Danish journalists here have told me Peter Madsen's black T-shirt and jeans combination isn't unusual attire in courtrooms in Denmark, where casual business dress is common. What fluent Danish speakers here say is significant is that while he is able to speak at length about his own actions and his passion for all things nautical, his answers about what specifically happened to Kim Wall on the night she died have been shorter and less clear. He has continued to deny killing the Swedish journalist, repeatedly describing her death as \"terrible\". During the session, the prosecution said: Prosecution wants to make the argument that #KimWall's death was murder and it was premeditated #SubmarineTrial #PeterMadsen End of Twitter post by @maddysavage The trial is expected to last 12 days over seven weeks, with a verdict expected on 25 April. Who was Kim Wall?\nThe journalist was born in 1987 and grew up in a close-knit community in the small town of Trelleborg in southern Sweden, just across the strait dividing Denmark from Sweden. She studied international relations at London School of Economics and went on to gain a place on the rigorous masters programme of Columbia University's School of Journalism - described as the \"Oxbridge of journalism\". She had a long career in journalism, having previously reported from North Korea, the South Pacific, Uganda and Haiti, writing for the New York Times, Guardian, Vice and the South China Morning Post.

        "content": "Women workers in Spain are marking International Women's Day with an unprecedented strike targeting gender inequality and sexual discrimination. Work has been halted as part of a 24-hour strike organised by the 8 March Commission and backed by 10 unions and some of Spain's top women politicians. Scores of marches under the slogan \"if we stop, the world stops\" are taking place across Spain. Events marking the day are being held in dozens of other nations. What's happening in Spain?\nWomen taking part have stopped working and have been urged by organisers to spend no money and ditch any domestic chores for the day. Police were called to stop protesters blocking main roads in Barcelona but some women pickets still brought areas to a standstill. Public transport nationwide is available but at reduced services and flights have also been affected. Evening marches in Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Valencia and a number of other cities are leading events in 200 Spanish locations. Many prominent women in the media were absent from their programmes. The 8 March Commission is behind the strike. Its manifesto calls for \"a society free of sexist oppression, exploitation and violence\" and says: \"We do not accept worse working conditions, nor being paid less than men for the same work.\" A poll of 1,500 people for the El Pais daily suggested 82% supported the strike, while 76% thought women in Spain had harder lives than men. Feminist groups only want women to strike to show how important their absence is but Spanish law does not allow for single-gender strikes and men were welcome to support it. The two main unions had called for members to stop work for two hours in the morning, and said that 5.3 million people had joined the stoppage. Some have opposed the strike. The ruling centre-right party, the Partido Popular (PP), said the action was \"for feminist elites and not real women with everyday problems\". However, two of the five female ministers in Spain's conservative government, Agriculture Minister Isabel Garc\u00eda Tejerina and the president of the Madrid region, Cristina Cifuentes, said they would work longer hours to show the capacity of women. Actress Penelope Cruz cancelled planned public events and said she would go on \"domestic\" strike. The mayors of Madrid and Barcelona - Manuela Carmena and Ada Colau - are also backing the strike. But the National Federation of Self-Employed Workers told El Pais that self-employed women remained overwhelmingly at work. In Spain, women were paid 13% and 19% less than their male counterparts in the public and private sectors respectively, data from the European Union's statistical provider Eurostat said. You might also like:\nWhat's happening elsewhere in the world?\nHere's a round-up of some of the International Women's Day events so far: While leaders across Africa praised the role of women, the government in Ivory Coast decided to update a list of jobs that women are banned from doing. The labour laws now preclude \"work that exceeds the ability and physical capacity of women, or work that presents dangers which is likely to undermine their morality, for example, working underground or in the mines\". What are they saying on social media?\nUK PM Theresa May announced the launch of a consultation to improve protection of those suffering domestic abuse. She sent out a tweet in support of International Women's Day.

        "content": "The Farc former rebel group says its candidate for the presidential election in May is withdrawing from the race because of ill-health. The group's leader, Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o, is recovering after undergoing heart surgery in a Bogot\u00e1 clinic on Wednesday. Better known by his nom de guerre, \"Timochenko\", he had only been polling about 1% support. But the group says it will continue to stand in legislative polls this Sunday. Under the terms of the 2016 deal that brought an end to the Farc's half-century of armed struggle, it is guaranteed 10 seats in the legislature as long as it campaigns for them. It is still known by the same acronym as before but the letters now stand for the Alternative Revolutionary Force for the Common People rather than, as before, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. \"The surgery which took place yesterday, combined with... features of the electoral campaign, has led us to decline our presidential aspirations,\" said Farc number two and Senate candidate Ivan Marquez. The party has cancelled campaigning events over protests it says are from right-wing groups. Last month Timochenko's motorcade was pelted with tomatoes and eggs by angry protesters. Timochenko has a history of health problems - he suffered a heart attack while negotiating the peace deal in Cuba in 2015, a stroke in 2017 and another heart attack last week, prompting Wednesday's surgery.

The Italy international defender died at the age of 31 on Saturday after a sudden illness. Members of the Juventus squad that beat Tottenham on Wednesday night were in attendance, including Italy's national team captain Gianluigi Buffon. Astori will be buried in Bergamo, where he grew up and his parents still live. Astori leaves a wife and a two-year-old daughter. Audio of the service was broadcast to the thousands outside the church, many of whom were in tears. \"You were the son and the brother that everyone would like to have,\" Fiorentina's vice captain Milan Badelj said. \"Your parents didn't put a foot wrong with you, Davide.\" Badelj said that everyone who remembered Astori would tell his two-year daughter Vittoria that he had been a man with a capital 'M'. \"He has always been and will always be a Florentine,\" said the city's archbishop, Cardinal Giuseppe Betori. The crowd chanted \"There's only one captain\" as Astori was carried out of the church after the service. Florence's city government declared Thursday a day of mourning, with schools and businesses asked to observe one minute's silence at 12:00 GMT. Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini, who was in tears during a minute's silence for Astori at Wembley on Wednesday night, was in attendance along with team-mates and manager Massimiliano Allegri. Speaking after Juve's Champions League victory, Chiellini said: \"We dedicate the win to him. He is on our minds on this day. \"I cried many times. He was a fantastic player. It was very difficult during the match because we had to think of the game and the outcome, and it's not easy. But he's always in our heart,\" Another of Astori's former sides, AC Milan, are in action later on Thursday when they host Arsenal in the Europa League. ",

        "content": "\"I hope that someday women will be treated the same as men, that someday women will be paid the same as men. \"I also hope that someday I will be president of the US, even if I have to be the first woman to do it.\" These words come from a nine-year-old girl's letter - one of hundreds written in numerous languages to the women of 2037, as part of a global time capsule. To Future Women is collecting letters from people around the world, asking them to share their hopes for the generation to come. Georgia Saxelby is the artist behind the collection, hosted at The Philips Collection at the Natural History Museum in Washington DC. She launched the project on 21 January, a year after the worldwide Women's March, a protest organised largely in response to the inauguration of US President Donald Trump. \"The reason I chose letters is because [writing one] is an activity that instantly generates a purity of reflection,\" she says. \"The hand-written nature, the act of sitting down, of slowly considering words, not on a digital screen. \"Letter-writing has a tradition of being used to reveal intimate and alternative histories and it allows participants from all over the world to contribute.\" What is 100 Women?\nBBC 100 Women names 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year. We create documentaries, features and interviews about their lives, giving more space for stories that put women at the centre. On 8 March, BBC 100 Women will be showcasing inspirational stories from women in the UK and across the world. Follow BBC 100 Women on Instagram and Facebook and join the conversation. Replying to the nine-year-old girl, who signed her letter with the initials ERK, her grandparents and mother also share their visions for the future. \"Today, women are speaking out about abuse in all its forms,\" writes her grandfather. \"It is my hope, that in the 20 years since this letter was written, those brave female voices will have exposed these injustices and brought about real change. \"It is my hope that you have been, and will be, a part of this important and necessary movement.\" Her grandmother writes: \"[I hope] you will succeed based on your merits, not in spite of a rigged system that helps men but represses women. \"[I hope] that you will not doubt that you can do and be anything. \"And I hope you become president. I will vote for you.\" Georgia is gathering letters and putting them on display until July, at which point she will archive the entire collection until 2037, on the 20th anniversary of the Women's March. She's been working with a number of embassies in the US to translate them and to encourage people around the world to participate, as part of International Women's Day. Georgia says \"the sheer numbers\" of people involved in recent protests made her realise the women's movement \"couldn't be ignored\". \"Then with #MeToo, that wasn't a small thing and institutions have responded,\" she says. \"So I decided to use the formal archiving processes of a museum to historicise these gestures, which can seem individual but are actually much larger. \"Despite the leaps and bounds we've taken in the last century with regards to women's rights, still we forget and history forgets.\" Georgia points to the centenary of the suffragette movement in the UK and elsewhere as an example of this. \"I'm having to now fill gaps in my knowledge about what the suffragette movement was, who the main players were, how it worked, because I don't know,\" she says. \"I wasn't taught that. \"I want to make sure in 20 years, museums that are going to outlive me are going to revisit these conversations.\" Georgia still hasn't written her own letter; it's something she'll do just before she closes the archive. \"Lots of mothers and daughters have come in and written their letters together as an intergenerational activity which has been really beautiful,\" she says. One of the themes that crops up frequently in letters others have written is 'women in leadership.' Like the nine-year-old girl, one 26-year-old female letter writer is also keen to find if there's been a female US president. \"Was it Oprah?\" she asks. This 26-year-old she only realised she was a \"feminist\" in the last year. \"It always seemed like a big word with so many connotations,\" she writes. \"But now, I understand... it's standing up for myself and millions of my sisters.\" Time capsules often remain unopened for much longer than 20 years, but Georgia had a reason for picking this duration. \"It's a long enough time that great change can be made,\" she says. \"But it's a short enough time that we can really conceive of revisiting what we're writing now. We want to taste its rewards. \"It's one generation of women. Those women are going to be eating the seeds from the fruit we plant now.\" Reporting by Amelia Butterly and Georgina Pearce ",

        "content": "Phil Neville did not start by winning a trophy but the experience he got from the SheBelieves Cup was the next best thing. The new England boss wants to turn the Lionesses into the best team in the world and he will have learned an awful lot about what that will take from his first tournament in charge. I was in Orlando to watch England's defeat by the United States on Thursday and there was not much between us and the world champions. There was still a gap, however, and Neville has got until the World Cup in the summer of 2019 to close it. Media playback is not supported on this device Defensively, it was disappointing that we conceded four soft goals in three games against France, Germany and the hosts. But there were plenty of individual player performances that impressed me, and so did Neville himself. He not only played the bold attacking football he promised, he was willing to make changes quickly when things did not work. England only needed a draw against the US to win the SheBelieves Cup on goal difference but Neville did not want to settle for that. He had demanded that kind of winning mentality from his team before the tournament started and he had a really positive mindset himself. I don't think England played their best football against the US, especially compared with the way they began their campaign against France. But the changes Neville made put their opponents on the back foot with the score at 0-0 and made it clear that he was going for the win, not the draw that would have seen us lift the trophy. Media playback is not supported on this device There was no sense that he was stalling on any decisions either. I never got to a stage in any of the games where I thought something needed sorting out, because he had already acted on it by then. He was brave without being reckless and although he adapted his tactics depending on what was happening in games, he never changed his ethos of taking the game to the opposition. You could tell he has got 100% confidence in the girls from the way he was asking them to play and that trust will be reciprocated now they can see how his ideas work. Neville saw his side put in a dominant and ruthless performance against France in their tournament opener, before they showed real character to fight back twice to draw with Germany. Then England stuck at it against the US when things were not going well, and upped their game in the final stages when they almost grabbed a leveller. I think the US deserved their victory, but it was still a very positive way to end a tournament that we did not win. Media playback is not supported on this device Cynics might put England's performances in the US down to the effect of having a new manager but I know these girls, and that is not the case. They played their absolute hearts out and they love playing for their country. I think it shows. The free-flowing football they played against France and in parts of the other two games was not a temporary improvement, it is a permanent quality that this team possesses. It does seem like Neville has taken the shackles off, though. He has allowed them to play with some freedom and belief and this is what they are capable of - it is as simple as that. I was particularly impressed by Chelsea's Fran Kirby, who was in the number 10 role in the first two games, something she is probably a bit unfamiliar with for club and country. She was our pivotal player in the 4-1 win against France, not only getting on the scoresheet herself but creating things too. It was the same against Germany and then in the second half against the US she came alive and began to drive at their defence, causing them to back off. I really enjoyed seeing her utilised in that position and she seemed to develop a really good understanding of it quite quickly - her vision and awareness on the ball really stood out. Around her was the tenacity and fire of Nikita Parris and the quality of Toni Duggan, who scored a wonderful goal against France. England's forward line was brilliant at times, even without much preparation time - they have only had four training sessions with Neville - which makes me think they can get even better from here. Media playback is not supported on this device One thing that definitely has to improve is England's defending. Three of the four goals we conceded were own goals and I totally understand why Neville was unhappy with them. It is true that our defence was affected by injuries, with captain Steph Houghton not able to take part in the tournament and Anita Asante getting injured early in the first game. But those goals were down to something as basic as a breakdown in communication, which should not happen whether you are new to the international scene or you have played for England 100 times. Sometimes accepting responsibility is not easy to do but this group of players always analyses everything that happens during games. None of them will shy away from saying they could have done better, either individually or collectively as a unit. It is all part of the learning curve that these players face over the next few months, especially the ones who are relatively new to the squad. I really felt for Asante, who had earned her chance to get back into the picture, but is now facing a lay-off with a knee injury. Abbie McManus was thrown in at the deep end when she came on to replace Asante for her debut against France and I was really impressed with her pace in all three games - she had to be fast to deal with the US attackers. For players like McManus, Keira Walsh, Hannah Blundell and even Millie Bright, this was a chance for them to find out the difference between playing for your club and facing the very best international sides. In terms of the speed of the game and the speed of thought you need to cope with it, it is a massive step up. Neville has made a very encouraging start - now he needs to build on it. England's next game is a World Cup qualifier against Wales in Southampton on 6 April, which will be a very different test to any of the three games the Lionesses have faced in the past week. The US, Germany and France are ranked first, second and sixth in the world respectively - Wales are 35th. Although Wales have some quality in their team, their approach will not be to go on the attack against England like the teams above - instead they will shut up shop and then look to be clinical when they do get a chance. England will need to be clever and organised to ensure that does not happen because they cannot afford to switch off for a second even though they are likely to see a lot of the ball. So I want to see better discipline at the back and improved communication to avoid the lapses that cost us this week. We also need to show the kind of ruthlessness we showed when we were on top against France, when we did not let up at all. Put all of that together and we should get the right result in Neville's first competitive fixture to keep us on track for France 2019. Rachel Brown-Finnis was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan. ",

        "content": "The attempted murder of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, using a nerve agent was a \"brazen and reckless\" act, Amber Rudd has said. Mr Skripal and his daughter are still critically ill after being found collapsed on a bench in Salisbury city centre on Sunday. Counter-terrorism officers are working to find the origin of the nerve agent. A police officer, who was in intensive care, is now \"stable and conscious\", Wiltshire's chief constable said. Wiltshire Police named the officer as Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey. Addressing the House of Commons, the home secretary said the attack was \"attempted murder in the most cruel and public way\". Ms Rudd told MPs it was an \"outrageous crime\", adding that the government would \"act without hesitation as the facts become clearer\". She refused to speculate on whether the Russian state might have been involved in the attack, saying the police investigation should be based on \"facts, not rumour\". However, she said the government was committed to bringing the perpetrators to justice \"whoever they are and wherever they may be\". Prime Minister Theresa May told ITV News that \"if action needs to be taken then the government will do that\". \"We will do what is appropriate, we will do what is right, if it is proved to be the case that this is state-sponsored,\" she said. Russia has denied it was involved. Meanwhile, a doctor who was one of the first people the scene has described how she found Ms Skripal slumped unconscious on a bench, vomiting and fitting. She had also lost control of her bodily functions. The woman, who asked not to be named, told the BBC she moved Ms Skripal into the recovery position and opened her airway, as others tended to her father. She said treated her for almost 30 minutes, saying there was no sign of any chemical agent on Ms Skripal's face or body. The doctor said she had been worried she would be affected by the nerve agent, but added that she \"feels fine\". BBC correspondent Leila Nathoo said there had been \"a flurry of activity\" outside Mr Skripal's Salisbury home on Thursday. She said ambulances and an incident response team were in attendance and a police tent had been erected outside the house. Graves sealed off\nPart of a business park in nearby Amesbury also remains cordoned off, while the graves of Mr Skripal's wife and son at a Salisbury cemetery have also been taped off by police. It comes as police said government scientists have identified the nerve agent used, but will not be making that information public at this stage. A source familiar with the investigation told the BBC the agent was likely to be rarer than the Sarin gas thought to have been used in Syria and in an attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995. And it was said not to be VX - the nerve agent used to kill the half brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Malaysia last year. Earlier, Ms Rudd told the BBC the nerve agent used in the poisoning was \"very rare\". Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said Russia was becoming an \"ever greater threat\", amid speculation the attack could have some element of state involvement. \"Russia's being assertive, Russia's being more aggressive, and we have to change the way that we deal with it because we can't be in a situation in these areas of conflict where we are being pushed around by another nation,\" he told ITV's Good Morning Britain. Analysis\nBy Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent The fact the nerve agent is \"very rare\" will help the investigation narrow its focus. Making nerve agents and delivering them requires considerable infrastructure and the more unusual the agent the easier it will be to locate which country, even which laboratory, might be involved. That combined with police leads on who delivered the agent will form the basis for a determination of responsibility, along with any other intelligence that can be gathered. It may take days - even weeks - for the government to be confident enough to make a public statement, because it will not want to risk getting any details wrong. But if suspicions about Russia are confirmed, then some kind of action seems inevitable. The legacy of the 2006 Litvinenko case shows that expelling diplomats alone may not be regarded as much of a deterrent to future acts. Economic sanctions on the Russian elite may have more bite, but would require greater political will. Mr Skripal, 66, was convicted of passing secrets to MI6 but was given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a \"spy swap\". It is known that he and his 33-year-old daughter had visited the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found collapsed on a bench near the Maltings shopping centre. Police have yet to say if they know how and where the poison was administered. Officers said they wanted to speak to anyone who was in the centre of Salisbury on Sunday afternoon. They are particularly keen to hear from people who ate at Zizzi or drank in the Mill pub between 13:00 and 16:00 GMT. Both sites remain closed to the public. Nerve agents are highly toxic chemicals that stop the nervous system working and shut down bodily functions. They normally enter the body through the mouth or nose, but can also be absorbed through the eyes or skin. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, but is open to co-operating with British police if requested. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said foreign media had used the case as part of an anti-Russian campaign. Who is Sergei Skripal?\nSergei Skripal is a retired Russian military intelligence colonel who was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Mr Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years. Do you have any information to share on this story?

        "content": "The claim: There are more bed spaces available for vulnerable women fleeing domestic abuse than there were in 2010. Reality Check verdict: This is true - there are more bed spaces in refuges. But there are fewer refuges and more or less the same proportion of women are being turned away as they were in 2010. As proposed laws to protect victims of domestic abuse were announced, Home Secretary Amber Rudd drew attention to a 10% increase in bed spaces in refuges since 2010. The number of bed spaces in refuges in England has gone up from 3,467 in 2010 to 3,798 in 2017, which is about a 10% increase. That information comes from Routes to Support - the database of domestic abuse services in the UK. However, the same database shows the overall number of refuges available has fallen from 296 in 2010, to 276 in 2017 - a cut of 7%. This is part of a trend towards fewer, larger services that cover a bigger geographical area. In many cases, this means more women need to be provided with support by the same number of staff. According to the domestic abuse charity Women's Aid, these larger contracts have also meant tenders to run refuge services have increasingly been going to big organisations which don't specialise in domestic abuse provision, like housing associations. And funding for refuges has also fallen. More than three-quarters of local authorities with responsibility for providing refuges have cut their funding since 2010, by at least \u00a37m overall, according to Freedom of Information requests by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. Councils have a legal duty to provide accommodation to people made homeless by domestic abuse. The combination of less funding per bed and fewer specialist providers means some women cannot access bed spaces because they need specialist support for things like mental health or drug and alcohol use, which refuges are no longer able to provide. Women's Aid says its most recent annual survey suggested that 60% of referrals to refuges were turned down in 2016-17 amounting to more than 10,000 instances of women being turned away. This proportion has remained more or less unchanged since 2010 despite the increase in bed numbers. The charity Refuge, the largest provider of refuges for women and children escaping domestic violence in England, says that 80% of its services have suffered funding cuts since 2011 and overall its funding on average has been cut by a third. How has the law changed in England and Wales?\nThe draft Domestic Abuse Bill currently under consultation follows a number of changes to the law since 2010. You might have heard the startling statistic that two women are killed by partners or ex-partners every week in England and Wales. This comes from the Office for National Statistics, which produces official crime figures. It says that between April 2011 and March 2016, 415 women were killed by partners or ex-partners which equates to 1.6 women per week, a figure which is rounded up to two per week. We can't quantify exactly how common domestic abuse is. The latest available figures from the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which is a face-to-face survey of households, estimated that around four in five victims (79%) of partner abuse did not report it to the police. The most recent Crime Survey of England and Wales suggests 6% of women aged 16 to 59 had been victims of non-physical abuse, threats, force, sexual assault or stalking by a partner. This is equivalent to 992,000 victims last year. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter ",

'Limited' menus\n\"Our focus remains on ensuring our customers can enjoy our chicken without further disruption,\" said a KFC spokesperson. \"With that in mind, the decision has been taken in conjunction with QSL and DHL to revert the distribution contract for up to 350 of our restaurants in the north of the UK back to Bidvest Logistics. \"We've been working hard to resolve the present situation with QSL and DHL. This decision will ease pressure at DHL's Rugby depot, to help get our restaurants back to normal as quickly as possible.\" KFC said more than 97% of its restaurants were now open for business, but there would be \"some limited menus\" before full service was resumed.

        "content": "The attempted murder of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, using a nerve agent was a \"brazen and reckless\" act, Amber Rudd has said. Mr Skripal and his daughter are still critically ill after being found collapsed on a bench in Salisbury city centre on Sunday. Counter-terrorism officers are working to find the origin of the nerve agent. A police officer, who was in intensive care, is now \"stable and conscious\", Wiltshire's chief constable said. Wiltshire Police named the officer as Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey. Addressing the House of Commons, the home secretary said the attack was \"attempted murder in the most cruel and public way\". Ms Rudd told MPs it was an \"outrageous crime\", adding that the government would \"act without hesitation as the facts become clearer\". She refused to speculate on whether the Russian state might have been involved in the attack, saying the police investigation should be based on \"facts, not rumour\". However, she said the government was committed to bringing the perpetrators to justice \"whoever they are and wherever they may be\". Prime Minister Theresa May told ITV News that \"if action needs to be taken then the government will do that\". \"We will do what is appropriate, we will do what is right, if it is proved to be the case that this is state-sponsored,\" she said. Russia has denied it was involved. Meanwhile, a doctor who was one of the first people at the scene has described how she found Ms Skripal slumped unconscious on a bench, vomiting and fitting. She had also lost control of her bodily functions. The woman, who asked not to be named, told the BBC she moved Ms Skripal into the recovery position and opened her airway, as others tended to her father. She said she treated her for almost 30 minutes, saying there was no sign of any chemical agent on Ms Skripal's face or body. The doctor said she had been worried she would be affected by the nerve agent, but added that she \"feels fine\". BBC correspondent Leila Nathoo said there had been \"a flurry of activity\" outside Mr Skripal's Salisbury home on Thursday. She said ambulances and an incident response team were in attendance and a police tent had been erected outside the house. Graves sealed off\nPart of a business park in nearby Amesbury also remains cordoned off, while the graves of Mr Skripal's wife and son at a Salisbury cemetery have also been taped off by police. It comes as police said government scientists have identified the nerve agent used, but will not be making that information public at this stage. A source familiar with the investigation told the BBC the agent was likely to be rarer than the Sarin gas thought to have been used in Syria and in an attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995. And it was said not to be VX - the nerve agent used to kill the half brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Malaysia last year. Earlier, Ms Rudd told the BBC the nerve agent used in the poisoning was \"very rare\". Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said Russia was becoming an \"ever greater threat\", amid speculation the attack could have some element of state involvement. \"Russia's being assertive, Russia's being more aggressive, and we have to change the way that we deal with it because we can't be in a situation in these areas of conflict where we are being pushed around by another nation,\" he told ITV's Good Morning Britain. Analysis\nBy Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent The fact the nerve agent is \"very rare\" will help the investigation narrow its focus. Making nerve agents and delivering them requires considerable infrastructure and the more unusual the agent the easier it will be to locate which country, even which laboratory, might be involved. That combined with police leads on who delivered the agent will form the basis for a determination of responsibility, along with any other intelligence that can be gathered. It may take days - even weeks - for the government to be confident enough to make a public statement, because it will not want to risk getting any details wrong. But if suspicions about Russia are confirmed, then some kind of action seems inevitable. The legacy of the 2006 Litvinenko case shows that expelling diplomats alone may not be regarded as much of a deterrent to future acts. Economic sanctions on the Russian elite may have more bite, but would require greater political will. Mr Skripal, 66, was convicted of passing secrets to MI6 but was given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a \"spy swap\". It is known that he and his 33-year-old daughter had visited the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found collapsed on a bench near the Maltings shopping centre. Police have yet to say if they know how and where the poison was administered. Officers said they wanted to speak to anyone who was in the centre of Salisbury on Sunday afternoon. They are particularly keen to hear from people who ate at Zizzi or drank in the Mill pub between 13:00 and 16:00 GMT. Both sites remain closed to the public. Nerve agents are highly toxic chemicals that stop the nervous system working and shut down bodily functions. They normally enter the body through the mouth or nose, but can also be absorbed through the eyes or skin. Russia has insisted it has \"no information\" about what could have led to the incident, but is open to co-operating with British police if requested. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said foreign media had used the case as part of an anti-Russian campaign. Who is Sergei Skripal?\nSergei Skripal is a retired Russian military intelligence colonel who was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Mr Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years. Do you have any information to share on this story?

        "content": "Sebastian Vettel set the fastest lap ever recorded around the Circuit de Catalunya on the penultimate day of pre-season testing. The German was more than a second quicker than anyone else as Ferrari finally showed their hand before the start of the season later this month. Kevin Magnussen's Haas was an eye-opening second fastest ahead of Pierre Gasly's equally surprising Toro Rosso. Lewis Hamilton was only eighth fastest for pre-season favourites Mercedes. The world champion was more than two seconds slower than 2017 title rival Vettel as his team focused on longer runs and heavy fuel loads. Pre-season testing times are notoriously unreliable guides to actual form because the specification in which the cars are running is not known. Fuel loads, engine modes and tyre compounds all make a significant difference to performance. After a difficult run of reliability problems in pre-season testing so far, it was a better day for McLaren. The team did more than 100 laps in a day for the first time all winter and Stoffel Vandoorne was sixth fastest overall. There is still no clear picture of competitiveness going into the first race in Australia on 23-25 March. But the indications are that Mercedes, who have won the last four world titles, have an advantage over the field, with Ferrari and Red Bull their closest challengers. 1 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Ferrari 1:17.182 **** 2 Kevin Magnussen (Den) Haas-Ferrari 1:18.360 ** 3 Pierre Gasly (Fra) Toro Rosso-Honda 1:18.363 **** 4 Nico Hulkenberg (Ger) Renault 1:18.675 **** 5 Carlos Sainz (Spa) Renault 1:18.725 **** 6 Stoffel Vandoorne (Bel) McLaren-Renault 1:18.855 **** 7 Marcus Ericsson (Swe) Sauber-Ferrari 1:19.244 **** 8 Lewis Hamilton (GB) Mercedes 1:19.296 ** 9 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Mercedes 1:19.532 10 Robert Kubica (Pol) Williams-Mercedes 1:19.629 ** 11 Sergio Perez (Mex) Force India-Mercedes 1:19.634 **** 12 Max Verstappen (Ned) Red Bull-Renault 1:19.842 * 13 Lance Stroll (Can) Williams-Mercedes 1:20.276 * **** = time set on hyper-soft tyre; ** = super-soft tyre; * = soft; all others medium ",

More than 800,000 customers were without electricity, including some who have been without power since last Friday's powerful winter storm. Heavy snow and icy roads prompted officials to close schools and cancel or delay thousands of flights across the region. It is the second storm to hit the US East Coast in less than a week. More snow and wind gusts of up to 55 miles (88km/h) were expected to stretch across eastern New York through northern Maine on Thursday. Up to 18 inches (45cm) of snow could fall on northern New England, according to the National Weather Service. At least one death has been blamed on the storm. An 88-year-old woman died after she was struck by a falling tree in Suffern, New York, according to the Journal News newspaper. Amtrak rail operator suspended service between New York City and Boston until 11:00 local time (16:00 GMT) on Thursday, according to the company. Dozens of routes had also been cancelled and residents were advised to avoid travel unless necessary. More than 2,000 flights were cancelled as of Wednesday night, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware. Boston Public Schools cancelled classes on Thursday and officials declared snow emergencies in several Massachusetts communities, according to the Boston Globe newspaper. \"With snow removal efforts underway, motorists are asked to stay off roads, stay home and stay safe\", the Boston Police Department said on Twitter. The governors of New Jersey and Pennsylvania declared states of emergency, allowing for release of government funds for recovery and redevelopment operations if necessary. The Northeastern University women's basketball team was forced to push their bus out of the snow after it was stalled in Philadelphia. The team posted a video of the effort on Twitter.

At least nine people were also killed in the storm. Approximately 100,000 people were still without power after last week's storm, and efforts to install their power were stalled as the second storm swept through the region.

        "content": "Women workers in Spain are marking International Women's Day with an unprecedented strike targeting gender inequality and sexual discrimination. Unions said 5.3 million women had joined the 24-hour strike, backed by 10 unions and some of Spain's top women politicians. Thousands of women have joined street protests across Spain, shouting \"if we stop, the world stops\". Events marking the day are being held in dozens of other nations. What's happening in Spain?\nWomen taking part have stopped working and have been urged by organisers to spend no money and ditch any domestic chores for the day. Police were called to stop protesters blocking main roads in Barcelona but some women pickets still brought areas to a standstill. Public transport nationwide is available but at reduced services and flights have also been affected. Evening marches in Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Valencia and a number of other cities are leading events in 200 Spanish locations. Many prominent women in the media were absent from their programmes. The 8 March Commission is behind the strike. Its manifesto calls for \"a society free of sexist oppression, exploitation and violence\" and says: \"We do not accept worse working conditions, nor being paid less than men for the same work.\" A poll of 1,500 people for the El Pais daily suggested 82% supported the strike, while 76% thought women in Spain had harder lives than men. Feminist groups only want women to strike to show how important their absence is but Spanish law does not allow for single-gender strikes and men were welcome to support it. The two main unions had called for members to stop work for two hours in the morning. Some have opposed the strike. The ruling centre-right party, the Partido Popular (PP), said the action was \"for feminist elites and not real women with everyday problems\". Two of the five female ministers in Spain's conservative government, Agriculture Minister Isabel Garc\u00eda Tejerina and the president of the Madrid region, Cristina Cifuentes, said they would work longer hours to show the capacity of women. Actress Penelope Cruz cancelled planned public events and said she would go on \"domestic\" strike. The mayors of Madrid and Barcelona - Manuela Carmena and Ada Colau - are also backing the strike. But the National Federation of Self-Employed Workers told El Pais that self-employed women remained overwhelmingly at work. In Spain, women were paid 13% and 19% less than their male counterparts in the public and private sectors respectively, data from the European Union's statistical provider Eurostat said. You might also like:\nWhat's happening elsewhere in the world?\nHere's a round-up of some of the International Women's Day events so far: While leaders across Africa praised the role of women, the government in Ivory Coast decided to update a list of jobs that women are banned from doing. The labour laws now preclude \"work that exceeds the ability and physical capacity of women, or work that presents dangers which is likely to undermine their morality, for example, working underground or in the mines\". What are they saying on social media?\nUK PM Theresa May announced the launch of a consultation to improve protection of those suffering domestic abuse. She sent out a tweet in support of International Women's Day.

        "content": "Almost half of drivers who challenged parking and bus lane fines issued by local authorities were successful, figures obtained by the BBC suggest. Four out of 10 appeals to hundreds of councils across the UK over five years led to fines being cancelled. Motoring group the RAC said the data was \"frightening\" and showed drivers were \"right to appeal.\" The Local Government Association said the figures proved councils had an \"effective\" appeal process. Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act revealed that out of almost 4.3 million appeals, 1.8 million succeeded. They show 84 councils accepted more than half of challenges. Basingstoke and Deane council overturned fines in 90% of appeals. Aberdeenshire had the highest rate of successful appeals in Scotland, overturning 70% of challenged fines. Rhondda Cynon Taf in Wales cancelled 67% of challenged fines. The Northern Ireland Department for Infrastructure revealed 29% of appeals succeeded. Councils say that fines are not about making money and that income from on-street parking charges and fines goes back into running parking services, with any surplus spent on transport projects. 'Driven mad'\nRichard Chaumeton runs a roofing and scaffolding business in Kentish Town, north London, but says he has become \"something of an expert\" on appealing against parking tickets. \"The parking attendants in Camden all call me 'Trouble',\" he said. Mr Chaumeton has successfully overturned hundreds of Penalty Charge Notices (PCNs) issued to his firm's vehicles across London - including \"about 1,500\" issued in Camden alone over more than a decade. With builders granted exemptions under the Traffic Management Act 2004 he says many tickets sent to his firm's vehicles should not have been issued, and criticised some authorities in the capital for their approach to appeals. \"They take it to [the Traffic Penalty Tribunal] to put as many impediments in your way as they can,\" he said. \"It's a very simple equation: it's all about money. \"They've driven us mad.\" Camden Council said that it \"may not always be obvious\" to a parking warden that a vehicle belongs to a builder and is exempt. A spokesman said: \"As with other councils we take a similar approach to errors made in good faith.\" He said the council would cancel PCNs the first time a driver incorrectly entered their registration number into a pay for parking machine and that any PCNs issued in error would be withdrawn. Derek Dishman has helped numerous motorists challenge their parking fines. Under the alias of 'Mr Mustard', he dealt with 345 cases in 2017 and said there were significant differences in how councils handle parking tickets across the UK. He said authorities should be \"lenient\" when drivers have good reasons to ask for a refund, and urged motorists not be to scared of going through the appeals process. \"If I was a parking manager and people write in with a half-decent excuse, I would just let it go,\" he said. \"It's mostly people making innocent errors or failing to understand complicated signs.\" You may also be interested in:\nFive patients made 8,303 emergency calls Two million to get 'big freeze' payments The fun stopped here: England's derelict theme parks 'Difficult balance'\nCouncillor Martin Tett, transport spokesman for the Local Government Association, said: \"As these figures confirm, people who want to challenge a parking fine have access to a clear and effective appeals process. \"Councils have to strike a difficult balance when setting parking policy, to make sure that there are spaces available for residents, high streets are kept vibrant and traffic is kept moving. They also need to ensure that emergency vehicles can get access to incidents quickly.\" RAC spokesman Simon Williams said councils should put right the issues that lead to people being given \"erroneous\" penalties in the first place. He said: \"These figures are frightening because they reveal that in a very high proportion of cases drivers have been right to appeal. Councils should learn from this.\" In Derby a ticket issued because snow was covering a parking permit was cancelled, while the Mayor of Leicester said he would cancel a penalty notice sent to a man who pulled into a bus lane to help a homeless man on Christmas Day. What the councils say\nBasingstoke and Deane Borough Council overturned one in every four of the penalties it issued. Of the 12,804 fines that were challenged, 11,575 (90%) were cancelled. The council said new parking machines at council-run car parks installed in 2017 had reduced the number of successful appeals. \"This has enabled our car parking enforcement officers to focus more on on-street and inconsiderate parking through both an education and enforcement campaign,\" said Simon Bound, cabinet member for communities and safety. Christchurch Borough Council, which had the second-highest rate of successful appeals over the five-year period, said it saw an increase in successful appeals after the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) stopped issuing tax discs in 2014, meaning some disabled drivers were erroneously penalised, and when the authority brought in a \"virtual parking permit system\". Jonathan Ross, the authority's car parks manager, said \"initial problems\" with the new system have been \"resolved\" and errors \"very much reduced\". A spokesman for Aberdeenshire Council, which saw 70% of PCN appeals between 2012 and 2017 succeed, said in dealing with first-time offenders \"we generally take the view that the cost of pursuing payment is not the best use of resources\". \"Rates of re-offending are low and the issuing of penalty notices is a useful tool in ensuring effective management of our car parks,\" he added. Waverley Borough Council said about a third of appeals the authority accepted were due to mistakes using its phone payment system and it will often give drivers \"the benefit of the doubt if it's their first mistake\". More on this story\nThe BBC sent Freedom of Information requests to every British local authority and the Northern Ireland Department for Infrastructure. We received full data for challenges between 2012 and 2017 from 245 authorities. Data on PCN appeals and cancellations can be viewed here. ",

        "content": "Eleven Asia-Pacific countries have just signed the trade pact formerly known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Although the US pulled out last year, the deal was salvaged by the remaining members who have signed it at a ceremony in Chile. Since then, the agreement has been given the even more unwieldy name of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Extraneous adjectives aside, its supporters say it's hugely significant, and could be a model for future trade deals. What does it do?\nIts main purpose is to slash trade tariffs between member countries. But it also seeks to reduce so-called non-tariff measures, which create obstacles to trade through regulations. There are chapters which aim to harmonise these regulations, or at least make them transparent and fair. There are also commitments to enforce minimum labour and environmental standards. It also includes a controversial Investor-State Dispute Settlement mechanism, which allows companies to sue governments when they believe a change in law has affected their profits. Who's in it?\nIn alphabetical order: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. The US is conspicuously absent. President Donald Trump fulfilled an election promise by pulling out in January last year, labelling the deal a disaster for American workers. Who are the winners and losers?\nIn short, the biggest winners are expected to be in Asia, while the wealthier countries, on balance, are not expected to receive as much of a boost. The Peterson Institute for International Economics says Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and Vietnam will each receive a bump of more than 2% to their economy by 2030. New Zealand, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Chile and Australia will all grow by an additional 1% or less. The same study says the US could be a big loser, foregoing a boost to its Gross Domestic Product of 0.5% (worth $131bn). What's more, it could lose an additional $2bn because firms in member countries have an incentive to trade with each other instead of with American companies. Donald Trump isn't the only one who has failed to be convinced of its value, though. Unions (particularly in wealthier member countries such as Australia and Canada) say the deal could be a job killer or push down wages. Some economists have also suggested that free trade agreements are rigged by special interests, which makes their economic value far more dubious. Is there any point without the US?\nYes, but there's no question the deal is diminished without the involvement of the world's largest economy. The remaining nations' economies account for more than 13% of the global economy - a total of $10 trillion dollars. With the US, the deal would have represented 40%. Australia's Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, says the deal has been set up to allow it to admit new members, possibly including the US. However, the revised agreement dropped about 20 of the original provisions (mostly those insisted on by the US), suggesting a US re-entry would require some intense negotiation. And although Donald Trump is on record saying he'd be open to a substantially better deal, his broader hostility toward trade pacts would suggest it's a remote possibility. Could the UK join?\nSure, why not? There's nothing banning it, even if most of the members are on the other side of the world. Australia, at least, has indicated that it's open to the idea, and the UK's International Trade Secretary, Liam Fox, has signalled some interest in joining after the UK completes its departure from the EU. But it's unlikely that membership would provide an immediate replacement for its EU trading partners after Brexit. That's because the region isn't a major destination for UK exports. And while growing new markets would arguably be the whole point, it's unlikely to happen overnight. The signatories accounted for less than 8% of UK exports last year, according to research by the Observatory of Economic Complexity at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ",

        "content": "The officer injured in the nerve agent attack has been named by police as Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey. The officer, 38, who was in intensive care following the incident, is now \"stable and conscious\", Wiltshire's chief constable Keir Pritchard said. Ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, are still critically ill after being found collapsed on a bench in Salisbury on Sunday. Twenty-one people have been been treated in hospital after the incident. Mr Pritchard said Det Sgt Bailey was sitting up and talking. \"I very much hope Nick will be on his feet back at work very soon,\" he told the BBC. \"We desperately miss him. \"He's a great character. He's a huge presence in Wiltshire Police, well-liked, well-loved, a massively dedicated officer. \"He's not the Nick that I know, but of course he's receiving a high level of treatment.\" A total of 21 people, including officers and staff, had been treated in hospital in the aftermath, he said. Only Mr Skripal, Ms Skripal and Det Sgt Bailey remain in hospital. Counter-terrorism officers are working to find the origin of the nerve agent. Earlier, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the attempted murder of Mr Skripal and his daughter was a \"brazen and reckless\" act. She refused to speculate on whether the Russian state might have been involved in the attack, saying the police investigation should be based on \"facts, not rumour\". Russia has denied it was involved. Meanwhile, a doctor who was one of the first people on the scene has described how she found Ms Skripal slumped unconscious on a bench, vomiting and fitting. She had also lost control of her bodily functions. Analysis\nBy Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent The fact the nerve agent is \"very rare\" will help the investigation narrow its focus. Making nerve agents and delivering them requires considerable infrastructure and the more unusual the agent the easier it will be to locate which country, even which laboratory, might be involved. That combined with police leads on who delivered the agent will form the basis for a determination of responsibility, along with any other intelligence that can be gathered. It may take days - even weeks - for the government to be confident enough to make a public statement, because it will not want to risk getting any details wrong. But if suspicions about Russia are confirmed, then some kind of action seems inevitable. The legacy of the 2006 Litvinenko case shows that expelling diplomats alone may not be regarded as much of a deterrent to future acts. Economic sanctions on the Russian elite may have more bite, but would require greater political will. The doctor, who asked not to be named, told the BBC she moved Ms Skripal into the recovery position and opened her airway, as others tended to her father. She said she treated her for almost 30 minutes, saying there was no sign of any chemical agent on Ms Skripal's face or body. The doctor said she had been worried she would be affected by the nerve agent, but added that she \"feels fine\". Mr Skripal, 66, was convicted of passing secrets to MI6 but was given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a \"spy swap\". It is known that he and his 33-year-old daughter had visited the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found collapsed on a bench near the Maltings shopping centre.

        "content": "Eleven Asia-Pacific countries have just signed the trade pact formerly known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Although the US pulled out last year, the deal was salvaged by the remaining members, who signed it at a ceremony in the Chilean city of Santiago. Chilean foreign minister Heraldo Munoz said the agreement was a strong signal \"against protectionist pressures, in favour of a world open to trade\". The deal covers a market of nearly 500 million people, despite the US pullout. In the absence of the US, it has been renamed the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Extraneous adjectives aside, its supporters say it's hugely significant, and could be a model for future trade deals. What does it do?\nIts main purpose is to slash trade tariffs between member countries. But it also seeks to reduce so-called non-tariff measures, which create obstacles to trade through regulations. There are chapters which aim to harmonise these regulations, or at least make them transparent and fair. There are also commitments to enforce minimum labour and environmental standards. It also includes a controversial Investor-State Dispute Settlement mechanism, which allows companies to sue governments when they believe a change in law has affected their profits. Who's in it?\nIn alphabetical order: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. The US is conspicuously absent. President Donald Trump fulfilled an election promise by pulling out in January last year, labelling the deal a disaster for American workers. Who are the winners and losers?\nIn short, the biggest winners are expected to be in Asia, while the wealthier countries, on balance, are not expected to receive as much of a boost. The Peterson Institute for International Economics says Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and Vietnam will each receive a bump of more than 2% to their economy by 2030. New Zealand, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Chile and Australia will all grow by an additional 1% or less. The same study says the US could be a big loser, foregoing a boost to its Gross Domestic Product of 0.5% (worth $131bn). What's more, it could lose an additional $2bn because firms in member countries have an incentive to trade with each other instead of with American companies. Donald Trump isn't the only one who has failed to be convinced of its value, though. Unions (particularly in wealthier member countries such as Australia and Canada) say the deal could be a job killer or push down wages. Some economists have also suggested that free trade agreements are rigged by special interests, which makes their economic value far more dubious. Is there any point without the US?\nYes, but there's no question the deal is diminished without the involvement of the world's largest economy. The remaining nations' economies account for more than 13% of the global economy - a total of $10 trillion dollars. With the US, the deal would have represented 40%. Australia's Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, says the deal has been set up to allow it to admit new members, possibly including the US. However, the revised agreement dropped about 20 of the original provisions (mostly those insisted on by the US), suggesting a US re-entry would require some intense negotiation. And although Donald Trump is on record saying he'd be open to a substantially better deal, his broader hostility toward trade pacts would suggest it's a remote possibility. Could the UK join?\nSure, why not? There's nothing banning it, even if most of the members are on the other side of the world. Australia, at least, has indicated that it's open to the idea, and the UK's International Trade Secretary, Liam Fox, has signalled some interest in joining after the UK completes its departure from the EU. But it's unlikely that membership would provide an immediate replacement for its EU trading partners after Brexit. That's because the region isn't a major destination for UK exports. And while growing new markets would arguably be the whole point, it's unlikely to happen overnight. The signatories accounted for less than 8% of UK exports last year, according to research by the Observatory of Economic Complexity at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ",

        "content": "Influential Russian lawmaker Leonid Slutsky has apologised to women he has \"wittingly or unwittingly\" caused distress. This comes after three Russian female journalists publicly accused him of sexual harassment. Mr Slutsky denies the accusations and has threatened to take the women to court for defamation. In his apology, he did not mention anyone by name. Russia does not have laws that cover sexual harassment specifically. The country has not had the same backlash against sexual harassment as seen in the US and Western Europe in the wake of high-profile scandals. What did Mr Slutsky say?\nHe posted on Facebook (in Russian) to mark International Women's Day. \"I would like to use this opportunity to apologise to those of you whom I have caused distress - wittingly or unwittingly,\" Mr Slutsky wrote. \"Trust me, I meant no harm.\" Mr Slutsky, 50, heads the influential committee on international affairs in the State Duma (the lower chamber of parliament). He is a senior member of the Liberal Democratic party. What are the allegations against him?\nThree female journalists have publicly accused the MP of sexual harassment. BBC Russian Service's Farida Rustamova is one of them. She has an audio recording of the incident, which took place on 24 March 2017 last year. The BBC has the recording in its possession but has decided not to publish it. Ms Rustamova went to Mr Slutsky's parliamentary office to get a comment about the then French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen's visit to Russia. During the conversation, Mr Slutsky unexpectedly changed the subject and asked if she would like to leave the BBC to work for him. After she refused, he complained that she wouldn't kiss him and was also heard suggesting that she could be his mistress. She says he then touched her inappropriately and when she objected he could be heard telling her: \"I don't feel people up. Well, OK, just a little. 'Feel people up' is an ugly expression.\" The BBC has asked Mr Slutsky to comment on the incident but he has not responded. Ms Rustamova joins two journalists - TV channel RTVI deputy editor Yekaterina Kotrikadze and TV Rain producer Daria Zhuk - who have both, in the last two weeks, accused Mr Slutsky of sexual impropriety.

        "content": "The Kardashians are some of the most divisive figures in popular celebrity culture - spearheaded by Hollywood socialite Kim's rise to fame, the family have become household names. Together they have a reality television show which recently celebrated its 10th anniversary. The programme has spawned multiple spin-offs and an ever-growing family business empire. Love them or loathe them, the Kardashians have made tens of millions by using their celebrity to become powerhouses of the beauty, tech and fashion industries. But Kim Kardashian's decision to launch a \"women's empowerment\" add-on to her personal emoji collection for International Women's Day has received a considerable online backlash. The collection features slogans such as \"nasty woman\", \"my body, my choice\" and \"full time feminist\". Some on social media celebrated the move as positive promotion of ideals of equality. Others accused the personality of hypocrisy because her other products and emojis are provocative and sexualised. I love the message behind the new Kimoji\u2019s. I\u2019m obsessed with seeing women encourage, support and empower other women. It\u2019s my favorite. We need more of it. #KIMOJI pic.twitter.com/S8k4SBKUjl End of Twitter post by @MUNCHKiN_XO Women\u2019s Empowerment emojis is a slap to every women who has stood to fight for our rights. I'm sure #AnnFrank #MalalaYousafzai #rosaparks fought for us all so u can use girl power to sell this...All Class pic.twitter.com/eJsJ4dV8PZ End of Twitter post by @ElizabethThee But this kind of controversy around Kim, in particular, is nothing new. In 2016, she posted a naked (but censored) picture of herself around International Women's Day to her millions of online followers and provoked a Twitterstorm. Celebrities such as Bette Midler and Pink criticised her. Others, such as Miley Cyrus, posed nude in solidarity. pic.twitter.com/NPRoOcF0y9 End of Twitter post by @Pink She criticised comments labelling her a \"bad role model\" for the image, and hit out at people bringing up a sex tape that was released without her permission in 2007. \"I am more than something that happened 13 years ago,\" she wrote in 2016. \"I am empowered by my body. I am empowered by my sexuality. I am empowered by feeling comfortable in my skin... I hope that through this platform I have been given, I can encourage the same empowerment for girls and women all over the world.\" The debate around whether nudity has a place in modern-day feminism is not isolated to the Kardashians. When actress Emma Watson, a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador and activist, exposed her breasts in a Vanity Fair photo-shoot last year, it sparked similar comments. She responded angrily, asking what her body had to do with her feminist politics. More on International Women's Day:\nModel Amber Rose, a vocal advocate against \"slut-shaming\" has argued the same, writing in Marie Claire that: \"My definition of feminism is simple: EQUALITY. It's not having to base your entire existence around the old school, ultra-oppressive expectations men have for women. \"As an intersectional feminist, I advocate for women from all walks of life and think that all women should be allowed to do whatever they want with their bodies.\" Kathryn Trevenen, associate professor at the University of Ottawa Institute of Feminist and Gender Studies, told the BBC that comments about how celebrities such as Kim Kardashian presented themselves demonstrated how much women's bodies were still \"policed\". \"I worry about the ways in which critiques focus on her femininity, her sex tape and her sexuality,\" she said. \"This is very a common shaming technique. But also, this is very on-brand for her. I'd be more interested [in the emojis] if it was more provocative.\" But she pointed to \"much more interesting\" dialogue and work of celebrities such as US rapper Cardi B, who has spoken candidly about her former career in sex work. \"Kim is so famous that she gets the attention - but it's not a big change,\" she told the BBC. \"She's not the best to talk about. There are so many other women - indigenous women, women of colour - in front of important struggles.\" Part of the social media debate about the Kimojis is that Kim previously said she resisted the term \"feminist\" because she did not believe in labels. \"I'll always fight for women's rights. Always,\" she said in a 2016 blog post. \"I support women to the fullest. But, at the end of the day, no one should feel pressured to be labelled as anything just because they believe in certain things and support certain values or ideals.\" People on social media questioned if the emoji launch meant she had changed her mind on the term. Dr Cynthia Carter, who specialises in feminist media studies at the University of Cardiff, acknowledged that many feminist academics took issue with self-objectification by celebrities such as Kim Kardashian or Beyonce. \"But if someone wants to call themselves a feminist, they should be able to,\" she said. \"Who is to say that there has to be one type of feminist and everyone has to sing from the same hymn sheet?\" she told the BBC, adding that she thought feminism should be a dialogue, and not a hierarchy. Some on social media accused Kim of using feminism and International Women's Day to profit financially with a $2.99 price tag. Prominent women's rights lawyer Gloria Allred told news website TooFab the reality star should consider donating the profits to female rights groups. One Twitter user replied to her: \"So it's less about empowering women but empowering your bank account.\" Another replied: \"You could have and should have offered this one download for free. Feminism is not for sale or your profit.\" So Kim Kardashian only became a feminist once she could market it with #KIMOJI pic.twitter.com/HFXnNZqrOv End of Twitter post by @CurrentlyNerdy Ms Carter echoed that concern: \"Where you could critique her is this conflation of capitalism, and all the inherent inequalities that come from that.\" She believes the problem is not with individuals like Kim, but with wider society's selection of idols: \"Why not think of role models more widely than just celebrities? Women in business, in academia, or in science? Especially on International Women's Day, we need to broaden our focus here.\" ",

        "content": "Women workers in Spain are marking International Women's Day with an unprecedented strike targeting gender inequality and sexual discrimination. Unions said 5.3 million women had joined the 24-hour strike, backed by 10 unions and some of Spain's top women politicians. Hundreds of thousands of women have joined street protests across Spain, shouting \"if we stop, the world stops\". Events marking the day are being held in dozens of other nations. What's happening in Spain?\nWomen taking part have stopped working and have been urged by organisers to spend no money and ditch any domestic chores for the day. Police were called to stop protesters blocking main roads in Barcelona but some women pickets still brought areas to a standstill. Public transport nationwide is available but at reduced services and flights have also been affected. Evening marches in Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Valencia and a number of other cities are leading events in 200 Spanish locations. \"I lived under the dictatorship, I lived under democracy and we haven't made much headway,\" teacher Concha Noverges told Reuters news agency as she stood on a picket line at a public school in Madrid. \"A lot remains to be done and we, in the education sector, have a big role to play.\" Ana Reyes, a 37-year-old PR executive, told AFP news agency she was striking \"in the hope that the importance of half of the population will be recognised and that it will bring about a real change\". The 8 March Commission is behind the strike. Its manifesto calls for \"a society free of sexist oppression, exploitation and violence\" and says: \"We do not accept worse working conditions, nor being paid less than men for the same work.\" A poll of 1,500 people for the El Pais daily suggested 82% supported the strike, while 76% thought women in Spain had harder lives than men. Feminist groups only want women to strike to show how important their absence is but Spanish law does not allow for single-gender strikes and men were welcome to support it. The two main unions had called for members to stop work for two hours in the morning. What has the reaction been?\nSome have opposed the strike. The ruling centre-right party, the Partido Popular (PP), said the action was \"for feminist elites and not real women with everyday problems\". Two of the five female ministers in Spain's conservative government, Agriculture Minister Isabel Garc\u00eda Teresina and the president of the Madrid region, Cristina Cifuentes, said they would work longer hours to show the capacity of women. But well-known female presenters were absent from TV screens and radio airwaves. Actress Penelope Cruz cancelled planned public events and said she would go on \"domestic\" strike. The mayors of Madrid and Barcelona - Manuela Carmena and Ada Colau - are also backing the strike. But the National Federation of Self-Employed Workers told El Pais that self-employed women remained overwhelmingly at work. In Spain, women were paid 13% and 19% less than their male counterparts in the public and private sectors respectively, data from the European Union's statistical provider Eurostat said. You might also like:\nWhat's happening elsewhere in the world?\nHere's a round-up of some of the International Women's Day events: While leaders across Africa praised the role of women, the government in Ivory Coast decided to update a list of jobs that women are banned from doing. The labour laws now preclude \"work that exceeds the ability and physical capacity of women, or work that presents dangers which is likely to undermine their morality, for example, working underground or in the mines\".

The officer, 38, who was in intensive care following the incident, is now \"stable and conscious\", Wiltshire's chief constable Keir Pritchard said. Ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, are still critically ill after being found collapsed on a bench in Salisbury on Sunday. Twenty-one people have been been treated in hospital after the incident. Mr Pritchard said Det Sgt Bailey was sitting up and was \"very anxious\" and concerned. \"I very much hope Nick will be on his feet back at work very soon,\" he told the BBC. \"We desperately miss him. \"He's a great character. He's a huge presence in Wiltshire Police, well-liked, well-loved, a massively dedicated officer. \"He's not the Nick that I know, but of course he's receiving a high level of treatment.\" A total of 21 people, including officers and staff, had been treated in hospital in the aftermath, he said. Only Mr Skripal, Ms Skripal and Det Sgt Bailey remain in hospital. Counter-terrorism officers are working to find the origin of the nerve agent. Earlier, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the attempted murder of Mr Skripal and his daughter was a \"brazen and reckless\" act. She refused to speculate on whether the Russian state might have been involved in the attack, saying the police investigation should be based on \"facts, not rumour\". Russia has denied it was involved. Meanwhile, a doctor who was one of the first people on the scene has described how she found Ms Skripal slumped unconscious on a bench, vomiting and fitting. She had also lost control of her bodily functions. Analysis\nBy Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent The fact the nerve agent is \"very rare\" will help the investigation narrow its focus. Making nerve agents and delivering them requires considerable infrastructure and the more unusual the agent the easier it will be to locate which country, even which laboratory, might be involved. That combined with police leads on who delivered the agent will form the basis for a determination of responsibility, along with any other intelligence that can be gathered. It may take days - even weeks - for the government to be confident enough to make a public statement, because it will not want to risk getting any details wrong. But if suspicions about Russia are confirmed, then some kind of action seems inevitable. The legacy of the 2006 Litvinenko case shows that expelling diplomats alone may not be regarded as much of a deterrent to future acts. Economic sanctions on the Russian elite may have more bite, but would require greater political will. The doctor, who asked not to be named, told the BBC she moved Ms Skripal into the recovery position and opened her airway, as others tended to her father. She said she treated her for almost 30 minutes, saying there was no sign of any chemical agent on Ms Skripal's face or body. The doctor said she had been worried she would be affected by the nerve agent, but added that she \"feels fine\". Mr Skripal, 66, was convicted of passing secrets to MI6 but was given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a \"spy swap\". It is known that he and his 33-year-old daughter had visited the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found collapsed on a bench near the Maltings shopping centre. BBC correspondent Leila Nathoo said there had been \"a flurry of activity\" outside Mr Skripal's Salisbury home on Thursday. She said ambulances and an incident response team were in attendance and a police tent had been put up outside the house. The graves of Mr Skripal's wife and son at a Salisbury cemetery were also taped off. Police have yet to say if they know how and where the poison was administered. Officers said they wanted to speak to anyone who was in the centre of Salisbury on Sunday afternoon. They are particularly keen to hear from people who ate at Zizzi or drank in the Mill pub between 13:00 and 16:00 GMT. Both sites remain closed to the public. Part of a business park in nearby Amesbury also remains cordoned off. Do you have any information to share on this story? Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

        "content": "Bones discovered on a Pacific island in 1940 \"likely\" belonged to famed pilot Amelia Earhart, according to a US peer reviewed science journal. Earhart, her plane, and her navigator vanished without a trace in 1937 over the Pacific Ocean. Many theories have sought to explain her disappearance. But a new study published in Forensic Anthropology claims these bones prove she died as an island castaway. The report claims they are a 99% match, despite an earlier conclusion. The study, titled Amelia Earhart and the Nikumaroro Bones, was first published by the University of Florida and conducted by Professor Richard Jantz from the University of Tennessee. It disputes that the remains found on the eastern Pacific island of Nikumaroro - about 1,800 miles (2,900km) southwest of Hawaii - belonged to a man, as a researcher had determined in 1941. Earhart was known to have been near the island when she vanished during her doomed attempt to fly across the globe. A British party exploring the island for habitation in 1940 found a human skull, a woman's shoe, a Navy tool used by her navigator Fred Noonan (who also vanished), and a bottle of the herbal liqueur Benedictine - \"something Earhart was known to carry\". \"There was suspicion at the time that the bones could be the remains of Amelia Earhart,\" Dr Jantz wrote in the study. The party found a total of 13 bones, which were then sent to Fiji to be analysed by Dr D W Hoodless, who concluded that they had belonged to a male. But Dr Jantz argues that because forensic osteology - the study of bones - was still in its early stages, Dr Hoodless probably reached a wrong conclusion. \"Forensic anthropology was not well developed in the early 20th century,\" the paper states. Consulting Dr Hoodless' measurements of the bones, Dr Jantz used Fordisc, a modern computer programme now widely used by forensic anthropologists, to compare them to Earhart's height and body stature. The bones have unfortunately since been lost, and so cannot be analysed. But the research team used historical photographs, as well as her pilots and drivers licences, to determine that her body proportions matched the skeletal remains. A \"historical seamstress\" was also consulted to analyse her clothing, including \"the inseam length and waist circumference of Earhart's trousers\". \"This analysis reveals that Earhart is more similar to the Nikumaroro bones than 99% of individuals in a large reference sample,\" the report states. The research found the remains belonged to a woman of taller-than-average European descent, as Earhart was. \"This strongly supports the conclusion that the Nikumaroro bones belonged to Amelia Earhart.\" \"Until definitive evidence is presented that the remains are not those of Amelia Earhart,\" Dr Jantz writes in the paper, \"the most convincing argument is that they are hers.\" Earhart was the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean, and was considered one of the most famous women in the world when the mystery of her disappearance began. She is still frequently honoured as a pioneer of women's empowerment, and was recently chosen by Mattel to be depicted as a Barbie doll. ",

        "content": "Former world number one Billie Jean King has called for an end to five-set matches for men at Grand Slams. King, who won 12 Grand Slam titles including six at Wimbledon, said men's matches could last too long. The 74-year-old suggested women were willing to play five sets too but people wanted \"quality over quantity\". \"You do not get paid in the entertainment business by how long you play for,\" said King at the launch of the WTA Finals in Singapore. Longer matches and a packed schedule have been cited as a possible cause of the rise in serious injuries among some of the game's stars with Andy Murray, Rafael Nadal, Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka all suffering serious injuries in the past 12 months. \"Everyone keeps saying women don't want to play five sets but I don't want the men playing five sets anymore - it takes too much out them,\" said King, who founded the Women's Tennis Association in 1973. Since 2007, men and women have been paid the same prize money at Grand Slams - the only events, along with the Davis Cup, where men's matches are best of five sets throughout - but women are paid significantly less at women-only events compared with similar-sized men's events. Novak Djokovic, the president of the ATP player council, has previously called for men to earn more than women, saying more people watch men's tennis. ",

        "content": "Brexit should not overshadow plans to boost growth, a business lobby group conference has heard. The biggest challenges facing businesses in the UK are to do with \"fundamentals\" rather than Brexit, the British Chambers of Commerce says. The UK government said it was committed to its industrial strategy and boosting productivity. Policy makers have wrestled with low UK productivity growth since the financial crisis. 'Get the basics right'\n\"Government can do more than one thing at once,\" Adam Marshall, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) told BBC 5 live's Wake Up To Money. \"The best possible Brexit deal will not matter to the UK's competitiveness if the roads remain potholed and congested, if you can't get mobile phone coverage around the UK, if business broadband is poor and companies can't get the people they need because the training system isn't working to deliver for them.\" In a speech to a BCC conference in London, Mr Marshall said: \"Successive governments have acknowledged that more could be done to get the basics right for business. \"Indeed, the current government's developing industrial strategy is upfront about many of these challenges. \"Yet the leadership and the infrastructure simply aren't there to make change happen.\" The BCC called on the government to fund repairs on local roads, improve the capacity of railways and airports, build more houses, get rid of of mobile phone \"not-spots\", make the apprenticeship system stable and come up with a clear and easy-to-use immigration system. 'Fit for the future'\nMr Marshall also said that \"business communities are worried about\" policies being put forward by the Labour leadership, particularly nationalisation. His comments echo earlier calls by the BCC for clarity of leadership. A Department for Business, Energy and Industry Strategy spokesperson said: \"The government's commitment to boosting the productivity and earning power of people and places across the UK remains steadfast. \"Through our industrial strategy, we are building a Britain fit for the future, with a plan to help businesses create better, higher-paying jobs in every part of the UK.\" It said its \u00a31.7bn Transforming Cities Fund will \"address weaknesses in city transport systems while improving connectivity, reducing congestion and introducing new mobility services and technology\". The spokesperson added that the government had committed to raising research and development investment to 2.4% of GDP by 2027 \"ensuring our world-class research and innovation base continues to thrive\". The UK government is in continuing discussions with the European Union about Brexit. On Wednesday, the EU rejected a UK argument that financial services should be included in a free-trade agreement.

        "content": "Arsenal put their recent problems to one side as a polished performance at fallen giants AC Milan gave them the upper hand in their Europa League last-16 tie. The Gunners arrived at the San Siro at arguably the lowest point of manager Arsene Wenger's 22-year reign, yet responded to a run of four straight defeats with a confident and controlled display against their Italian hosts. Henrikh Mkhitaryan's first goal for the club put the Premier League side ahead, cutting in from the left to fire in with the aid of a deflection off Milan skipper Leonardo Bonucci. Wenger spoke before the game about his team showing fight without compromising their attacking principles - and they delivered in a dominant first-half performance. Aaron Ramsey deservedly doubled their lead before half-time, collecting Mesut Ozil's piercing pass through the centre of Milan's defence to round keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma and tap in. Milan tried to up the tempo after the break, wasting a clear early chance to pull one back when Giacomo Bonaventura spooned over the bar. But Arsenal were largely unruffled from then on, limiting the home side to half chances with a solid defensive effort. The two away goals now make the Gunners firm favourites to reach the quarter-finals after next Thursday's second leg at Emirates Stadium. Arsenal travelled to Italy looking for respite from a torrid recent run during which the north London club have lost four straight games for the first time since October 2002. A toxic atmosphere has been hanging over the club as fans continue to turn against Wenger, with 88% of the Arsenal Supporters' Trust's (AST) 1,000 members voting this week in favour of the 68-year-old Frenchman's contract being terminated at the end of the season. Few of the 2,000 or so Gunners fans who travelled to the San Siro would have been confident of seeing a positive performance. But they watched a display containing commitment and organisation - two qualities sorely lacking in recent weeks - against a Milan side revitalised under Gennaro Gattuso. Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck led the line superbly with his tireless running, allowing Ozil, Mkhitaryan and Ramsey to find space from deeper positions when the team attacked. And defensively, they worked hard as a unit - marshalled by skipper Laurent Koscielny - to deny Milan space in attacking areas. Arsenal's problems are not going to be masked by one good result. However, their display could not help but give the impression that, even in their lowest moments, it would be foolish to write off their chances of going on to win the Europa League and secure a route back into the Champions League. Seven-time European champions Milan are a shadow of the force they once were, languishing in seventh place in Serie A despite spending more than \u00a3200m last summer in a bid to change their fortunes. However, they went into Arsenal's visit on a crest of a wave following the arrival of former midfielder Gattuso. He has transformed their season since replacing the sacked Vincenzo Montella in November, leading them on a 13-match unbeaten run and giving them faint hope of climbing into Serie A's European qualification places. Therefore, there was optimism among the 70,000 Rossoneri fans inside the atmospheric San Siro that Gattuso's side could make a huge statement in front of a bigger European audience. It seemed justified as they pinned Arsenal back in the opening few minutes - but that was as difficult as it got for the Gunners. Arsenal quickly wrestled their way back into the game, their passing and movement causing uncertainty in the Milan defence and their defensive solidity meaning the home attack quickly run out of ideas.

        "content": "Bones discovered on a Pacific island in 1940 are \"likely\" to be those of famed pilot Amelia Earhart, according to a US peer reviewed science journal. Earhart, her plane, and her navigator vanished without a trace in 1937 over the Pacific Ocean. Many theories have sought to explain her disappearance. But a new study published in Forensic Anthropology claims these bones prove she died as an island castaway. The report claims they are a 99% match, despite an earlier conclusion. The study, titled Amelia Earhart and the Nikumaroro Bones, was first published by the University of Florida and conducted by Professor Richard Jantz from the University of Tennessee. It disputes that the remains found on the eastern Pacific island of Nikumaroro - about 1,800 miles (2,900km) southwest of Hawaii - belonged to a man, as a researcher had determined in 1941. Earhart was known to have been near the island when she vanished during her doomed attempt to fly across the globe. A British party exploring the island for habitation in 1940 found a human skull, a woman's shoe, a Navy tool used by her navigator Fred Noonan (who also vanished), and a bottle of the herbal liqueur Benedictine - \"something Earhart was known to carry\". \"There was suspicion at the time that the bones could be the remains of Amelia Earhart,\" Dr Jantz wrote in the study. The party found a total of 13 bones, which were then sent to Fiji to be analysed by Dr D W Hoodless, who concluded that they had belonged to a male. But Dr Jantz argues that because forensic osteology - the study of bones - was still in its early stages, Dr Hoodless probably reached a wrong conclusion. \"Forensic anthropology was not well developed in the early 20th century,\" the paper states. Consulting Dr Hoodless' measurements of the bones, Dr Jantz used Fordisc, a modern computer programme now widely used by forensic anthropologists, to compare them to Earhart's height and body stature. The bones have unfortunately since been lost, and so cannot be analysed. But the research team used historical photographs, as well as her pilot's and driver's licences, to determine that her body proportions matched the skeletal remains. A \"historical seamstress\" was also consulted to analyse her clothing, including \"the inseam length and waist circumference of Earhart's trousers\". \"This analysis reveals that Earhart is more similar to the Nikumaroro bones than 99% of individuals in a large reference sample,\" the report states. The research found the remains belonged to a taller-than-average woman of European descent, as Earhart was. \"This strongly supports the conclusion that the Nikumaroro bones belonged to Amelia Earhart.\" \"Until definitive evidence is presented that the remains are not those of Amelia Earhart,\" Dr Jantz writes in the paper, \"the most convincing argument is that they are hers.\" Earhart was the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean, and was considered one of the most famous women in the world when the mystery of her disappearance began. She is still frequently honoured as a pioneer of women's empowerment, and was recently chosen by Mattel to be depicted as a Barbie doll. ",

        "content": "Allegations of racist, sexist and bullying behaviour have been made against the chairwoman of the Institute of Directors. Lady Barbara Judge told the Times newspaper she had temporarily stepped aside to contest the accusations. The business lobby group is meeting to discuss the contents of a report commissioned by the IoD into her alleged behaviour. The IoD frequently calls for better corporate governance in UK firms. The allegations reported in The Times are that Lady Judge made derogatory comments about staff, including that \"blacks can get aggressive\". Accusations\nLady Judge allegedly told the IoD's director general that \"the problem is we have one black and one pregnant woman [on the IoD secretariat] and that is the worst combination we could possibly have\". She also allegedly bullied her assistant, making her cry on a number of occasions. Lady Judge also allegedly made her assistant stand on the staircase for an hour \"whilst a painter considered the best light in which to paint a portrait of Lady Judge\". In addition, there were allegations that Lady Judge asked IoD staff to help organise a show for her fashion range at the Chinese embassy last September. She is also said to have put pressure on the facilities manager to meet a company that her son held an interest in with a view to fitting out the third floor of the IoD's office, despite the tender having been awarded. Lady Judge told the Times: \"This case concerns confidential allegations of a nature that I take very seriously. I have co-operated in full with the IoD's investigation in order to support its efforts to resolve this matter fairly. \"It is incredibly disappointing that a draft confidential legal report has been leaked before a decision has even been made to proceed and before I have been given an opportunity to respond to its findings, thereby denying me any right to a fair hearing.\" Analysis: Simon Gompertz, business correspondent Lady Judge is one of the country's most senior business figures, with a CV crammed with honours and directorships. She was previously chair of the Pension Protection Fund, had senior roles in the nuclear industry, and was appointed a CBE. After allegedly receiving a string of complaints, the Institute of Directors commissioned a report, the draft version of which has been discussed by the members' council. Lady Judge is contesting the allegations. Today the director general Stephen Martin wrote to the 30,000 members telling them they have a right to see the organisation embodying the highest standards of behaviour and governance. But there's now a fear that the affair is causing a civil war at the top of the IOD as board members take sides. One called the situation a corporate train wreck. Caroline Prosser of Hill Dickinson, the employment lawyer who wrote the report, told the BBC that the document submitted to the IoD was \"full and final\". She confirmed that the allegations as reported by the Times had been made. \"There are other serious allegations,\" she said, but declined to elaborate. Ms Prosser said: \"I had free rein to carry out a full and fair investigation.\" She said she had interviewed Lady Judge over two days for a total of 10-and-a-half hours with her lawyer from Addleshaw Goddard present. Ms Prosser also said she had interviewed IoD deputy Sir Kenneth Olisa over two days. The Times reported that she mentioned in her report that the IoD \"may wish\" to investigate how he and other board members had handled concerns from employees about Lady Judge's alleged conduct. He is quoted in the Times as criticising the senior council member who had commissioned the report, saying it \"patently fails to comply with the principles of natural justice... and is fatally flawed from a procedural perspective\", defamatory, and contained \"errors of fact\". The investigation, which was commissioned by Dame Joan Stringer, the IoD's senior council member, took in interviews from 14 complainants, Ms Prosser said. There were 41 allegations levelled against Lady Judge, she said. The complainants were from \"right across the organisation\" and included ones from junior staff, Ms Prosser added. The IoD said in a statement: \"You may have seen allegations about the conduct of some non-executive members of the IoD's board in the media this morning. \"The IoD takes these allegations very seriously. An independent law firm, Hill Dickinson, was commissioned to conduct a full investigation, and the findings have now been passed to the IoD's Board and Council. The Council will be meeting to discuss the report this afternoon. \"At all times, we seek to embody the highest standards of behaviour and governance. We aim to ensure this process is conducted thoroughly and fairly, and lives up to expectations of the IoD.\" ",

Arsenal quickly wrestled their way back into the game, their passing and movement causing uncertainty in the Milan defence and their defensive solidity meaning the home attack quickly run out of ideas. While Koscielny, Ramsey and Ozil all had strong cases to be named man of the match, Mkhitaryan shaded it after producing one of his best performances in an Arsenal shirt. The Armenia international has showed few flashes of brilliance since arriving from Manchester United in January, but showed his quality in a competition where he has thrived since moving to England. While Mkhitaryan struggled to make an impact in the Premier League for United last season, he scored six goals - including one in the final - as the Old Trafford club won the Europa League. In the San Siro, he had already been giving young Milan right-back Davide Calabria a torrid time before putting Arsenal on the path to victory with his first goal for the Gunners. He should have scored a second, clipping the crossbar shortly before Ramsey doubled the lead. Nevertheless, Mkhitaryan's performance offered encouragement to the travelling fans who will want to see him produce similar displays on a more regular basis.

        "content": "Arsenal put their recent problems to one side as a polished performance at fallen giants AC Milan gave them the upper hand in their Europa League last-16 tie. The Gunners arrived at the San Siro at arguably the lowest point of manager Arsene Wenger's 22-year reign, yet responded to a run of four straight defeats with a confident and controlled display against their Italian hosts. Henrikh Mkhitaryan's first goal for the club put the Premier League side ahead, cutting in from the left to fire in with the aid of a deflection off Milan skipper Leonardo Bonucci. Wenger spoke before the game about his team showing fight without compromising their attacking principles - and they delivered in a dominant first-half performance. Aaron Ramsey deservedly doubled their lead before half-time, collecting Mesut Ozil's piercing pass through the centre of Milan's defence to round keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma and tap in. Milan tried to up the tempo after the break, wasting a clear early chance to pull one back when Giacomo Bonaventura spooned over the bar. But Arsenal were largely unruffled from then on, limiting the home side to half chances with a solid defensive effort. The two away goals now make the Gunners firm favourites to reach the quarter-finals after next Thursday's second leg at Emirates Stadium. Arsenal travelled to Italy looking for respite from a torrid recent run during which the north London club have lost four straight games for the first time since October 2002. A toxic atmosphere has been hanging over the club as fans continue to turn against Wenger, with 88% of the Arsenal Supporters' Trust's (AST) 1,000 members voting this week in favour of the 68-year-old Frenchman's contract being terminated at the end of the season. Few of the 2,000 or so Gunners fans who travelled to the San Siro would have been confident of seeing a positive performance. But they watched a display containing commitment and organisation - two qualities sorely lacking in recent weeks - against a Milan side revitalised under Gennaro Gattuso. Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck led the line superbly with his tireless running, allowing Ozil, Mkhitaryan and Ramsey to find space from deeper positions when the team attacked. And defensively, they worked hard as a unit - marshalled by skipper Laurent Koscielny - to deny Milan space in attacking areas. Arsenal's problems are not going to be masked by one good result. However, their display could not help but give the impression that, even in their lowest moments, it would be foolish to write off their chances of somehow going on to win the Europa League and secure a route back into the Champions League. Seven-time European champions Milan are a shadow of the force they once were, languishing in seventh place in Serie A despite spending more than \u00a3200m last summer in a bid to change their fortunes. However, they went into Arsenal's visit on a crest of a wave following the arrival of former midfielder Gattuso. He has transformed their season since replacing the sacked Vincenzo Montella in November, leading them on a 13-match unbeaten run and giving them faint hope of climbing into Serie A's European qualification places. Therefore, there was optimism among the 70,000 Rossoneri fans inside the atmospheric San Siro that Gattuso's side could make a huge statement in front of a bigger European audience. It seemed justified as they pinned Arsenal back in the opening few minutes - but that was as difficult as it got for the Gunners. Arsenal quickly wrestled their way back into the game, their passing and movement causing uncertainty in the Milan defence and their solidity seeing the home attack quickly run out of ideas. While Koscielny, Ramsey and Ozil all had strong cases to be named man of the match, Mkhitaryan shaded it after producing one of his best performances in an Arsenal shirt. The Armenia international has showed few flashes of brilliance since arriving from Manchester United in January, but showed his quality in a competition where he has thrived since moving to England. While Mkhitaryan struggled to make an impact in the Premier League for United last season, he scored six goals - including one in the final - as the Old Trafford club won the Europa League. In the San Siro, he had already been giving young Milan right-back Davide Calabria a torrid time before putting Arsenal on the path to victory with his first goal for the Gunners. He should have scored a second, clipping the crossbar shortly before Ramsey doubled the lead. Nevertheless, Mkhitaryan's performance offered encouragement to the travelling fans who will want to see him produce similar displays on a more regular basis. Back to the Premier League for sixth-placed Arsenal. The Gunners, who are 13 points adrift of fourth-placed Tottenham, host mid-table Watford at the Emirates on Sunday (13:30 GMT).

        "content": "A Manchester-based author whose debut novel was initially rejected by British publishers has won one of the world's richest literary prizes. Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi - who's from Uganda and moved to the UK 17 years ago - has won one of the Windham Campbell Prizes from Yale University in the US. She will receive $165,000 (\u00a3119,000). \"I haven't been earning for a long, long time,\" she says. \"I really put everything into writing. So for this to happen is unbelievable.\" The prize money is more than double the amount that the Booker Prize winner gets, and organisers say it's the richest award dedicated to literature after the Nobel Prize. Makumbi is one of eight writers to receive Windham Campbell Prizes this year spanning fiction, non-fiction, drama and poetry - and is the only winner to have published just one full-length work. Two other British writers are also on the list, both for non-fiction - Sarah Bakewell and Olivia Laing. 'Too African'\nThe prizes were created by writer Donald Windham and also carry the name of his partner Sandy M Campbell. They were first awarded in 2013 to \"provide writers with the opportunity to focus on their work independent of financial concerns\". Makumbi said news of the award came out of the blue. \"It's American, and normally it's people who have got so many books [behind them],\" she said. \"So I'm surprised how I was one of them.\" Makumbi's debut novel Kintu was first published in Kenya four years ago after British publishers rejected it for being \"too African\". It was finally released in the UK this January. The author said British publishers and readers like to have something they can relate to - be it Western characters or familiar settings and storylines - if they're reading about Africa. But she describes Kintu as \"proper, proper Africa\". The book conjures myths and legends to tell the story of a Ugandan family who believe they have been cursed over 250 years. \"I had really locked Europe out,\" Makumbi says. \"But it was a little bit too much - the language, the way I wrote it - they [Brits] were not used to that kind of writing. But they are beginning now to open up I think. \"Readers are realising, OK, if I want to explore Africa I'd rather be told from an African point of view rather than being told things that I'm expected to want to know.\" 'It's about getting a paycheque'\nMakumbi was a high school teacher before moving to the UK to pursue her dream of a writing career. She began by studying creative writing in Manchester, then wrote Kintu while doing a PhD in Lancaster. The Windham Campbell Prize will help spread the word about the book - but for Makumbi, for now at least, the prize money will be the thing that changes her life. \"I would like to say it's more about getting to be known and whatever, but mainly it's about getting a paycheque,\" she admits. \"It's mainly about [doing] ordinary things that other people do that have a job. I have a partner but he's not earning much and I've not been really pulling my weight. \"I've just been taking and taking, and we are a working class family, so it's huge. And then, of course, now I can go and do research in different countries for my next project.\" 'Shocked' by British life\nShe didn't have to travel far to research a short story collection that will come out next January. It's title is Love Made in Manchester. \"I write the stories as a way of writing back to Ugandans, informing them what happens to us,\" she says. \"I'm telling them, 'You want to come to Britain? Hang on a minute. First read my story.'\" So what impression will Ugandans get of Britain if they do? \"It's not the world that they've been told it is. When you're in Uganda, Britain is the London Eye, Buckingham Palace, The Savoy, The Ritz - because this is how Britain markets itself. \"You never see the working class. That is what takes you by surprise. It's just shocking. \"You come here and see the working class and you're like, I should have paid attention to Dickens!\" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

        "content": "Women workers in Spain are marking International Women's Day with an unprecedented strike targeting gender inequality and sexual discrimination. Unions said 5.3 million women had joined the 24-hour strike, backed by 10 unions and some of Spain's top women politicians. Hundreds of thousands of women have joined street protests across Spain, shouting \"if we stop, the world stops\". Events marking the day are being held in dozens of other nations. What's happening in Spain?\nWomen taking part have stopped working and have been urged by organisers to spend no money and ditch any domestic chores for the day. Police were called to stop protesters blocking main roads in Barcelona but some women pickets still brought areas to a standstill. Public transport nationwide is available but at reduced services and flights have also been affected. Evening marches in Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Valencia and a number of other cities are leading events in 200 Spanish locations. \"I lived under the dictatorship, I lived under democracy and we haven't made much headway,\" teacher Concha Noverges told Reuters news agency as she stood on a picket line at a public school in Madrid. \"A lot remains to be done and we, in the education sector, have a big role to play.\" Ana Reyes, a 37-year-old PR executive, told AFP news agency she was striking \"in the hope that the importance of half of the population will be recognised and that it will bring about a real change\". More on International Women's Day:\nThe 8 March Commission is behind the strike. Its manifesto calls for \"a society free of sexist oppression, exploitation and violence\" and says: \"We do not accept worse working conditions, nor being paid less than men for the same work.\" A poll of 1,500 people for the El Pais daily suggested 82% supported the strike, while 76% thought women in Spain had harder lives than men. Feminist groups only want women to strike to show how important their absence is but Spanish law does not allow for single-gender strikes and men were welcome to support it. The two main unions had called for members to stop work for two hours in the morning. What has the reaction been?\nSome have opposed the strike. The ruling centre-right party, the Partido Popular (PP), said the action was \"for feminist elites and not real women with everyday problems\". Two of the five female ministers in Spain's conservative government, Agriculture Minister Isabel Garc\u00eda Teresina and the president of the Madrid region, Cristina Cifuentes, said they would work longer hours to show the capacity of women. But well-known female presenters were absent from TV screens and radio airwaves. Actress Penelope Cruz cancelled planned public events and said she would go on \"domestic\" strike. The mayors of Madrid and Barcelona - Manuela Carmena and Ada Colau - are also backing the strike. But the National Federation of Self-Employed Workers told El Pais that self-employed women remained overwhelmingly at work. In Spain, women were paid 13% and 19% less than men in the public and private sectors respectively, data from the European Union's statistical provider Eurostat said. You might also like:\nWhat's happening elsewhere in the world?\nHere's a round-up of some of the International Women's Day events: While leaders across Africa praised the role of women, the government in Ivory Coast decided to update a list of jobs that women are banned from doing. The labour laws now preclude \"work that exceeds the ability and physical capacity of women, or work that presents dangers which is likely to undermine their morality, for example, working underground or in the mines\".

        "content": "The European Commission has written to the UK government saying the UK owes \u20ac2.7bn (\u00a32.4bn) in customs duties on shoes and textiles imported from China. The UK is accused of doing too little to prevent fraud after it was warned about the problem by the EU's watchdog Olaf in 2017. It begins a legal process which could end at the European Court of Justice. HM Revenue and Customs said it did not recognise the commission's estimate of what it owed. The Olaf investigation said the UK was a \"significant hub\" for so-called undervaluation fraud - where importers can profit from evading customs duties and related taxes. The investigation found organised crime groups had been using fake invoices to undervalue goods being imported from China - many of which were destined for the black market in other parts of the EU, investigators claimed. Olaf have said they had warned HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) a number of times. But a government spokesman said: \"We do not recognise the European Commission's estimate of alleged duty loss. \"We take customs fraud very seriously, and we continue to evolve our response as new threats emerge. \"We will carefully examine the formal notice from the commission and respond in due course. \"The UK intends to continue to work closely with Olaf and the commission on customs fraud. \"HMRC has a very strong track record for tackling evasion and rule-breaking of all kinds, securing a record \u00a328.9bn last year that would otherwise have gone unpaid.\" HMRC said the commission's methodology overestimated UK import values and was not suitable to produce an estimate of alleged customs duty undervaluation. It said the estimate was based on EU average prices and failed to take into account the \"substantial growth in the low-value end of the UK clothing market\". ",

        "content": "The mystery winner of a $560m (\u00a3400m) lottery jackpot in New Hampshire has claimed her prize, US media report. The woman filed a lawsuit against the state to remain anonymous, but lawyers were allowed to pick up a lump sum of $352m in Powerball winnings. Lawyer William Shaheen is fighting to protect \"Jane Doe's\" identity. New Hampshire is one of the states that forces winners to reveal their names. \"My client doesn't want any accolades, she doesn't want any credit\", he said. After collecting her winnings on Wednesday, the mystery winner promised to donate $50m to charity, according to US media. \"She just wants to do good things,\" said Mr Shaheen, according to USA Today. Mr Shaheen also donated thousands of dollars to local charities, the paper reported. The organisation Girls Inc was given $150,000 and checks of $33,000 each were dispersed to chapters of the End 68 Hours of Hunger in cities across New Hampshire. Why stay anonymous?\nAccording to \"lottery lawyer\" Jason Kurland, only six US states currently allow lottery winners to remain anonymous: Delaware, Kansas, Maryland, North Dakota, South Carolina and Ohio. \"When I first meet [clients] they're all extremely overwhelmed and nervous. Everyone dreams of winning but doesn't actually think they're going to win\", he told the BBC. Individuals go from living relatively normal lives to suddenly never needing to worry about money again, especially winners who take home as much as mystery winner \"Jane Doe\". New Hampshire is among the few other states that allow people to form a trust to claim prize money anonymously. In 2016, the state's winner of a $487m US Powerball jackpot chose to remain anonymous, claiming the prize through a trust facilitated by a local law firm. After winning the $560m Powerball in January, \"Jane Doe\" made a \"huge mistake\" by following instructions and signing her name on the ticket, as recommended online. The law in New Hampshire requires that the winner's name, town and amount won become part of public record. \"Ms Doe wants \"the freedom to walk into a grocery store or attend public events without being known or targeted as the winner of a half-billion dollars\", according to court documents obtained by NewHampshire.com \"While we respect this player's desire to remain anonymous, state statutes and lottery rules clearly dictate protocols,\" said the New Hampshire Lottery Executive Director Charlie McIntyre in a statement in February. Although the euphoria of a jackpot win spurs many to publicly celebrate their win, Mr Kurland warned that when a person wins that much money \"everything changes\". \"A lot of them try to keep their personality and not change too much but obviously their lives have changed\", he said. Horror stories of tragic events befalling lottery winners litter the internet. The 1997 winner of $31m, Billie Bob Harrell Jr, committed suicide. Before taking his own life he told his financial adviser that \"winning the lottery is the worst thing that ever happened to me\", according to the Washington Post. 'I see both sides'\nWhat often happens to winners is that family members suddenly want to start businesses or ask for help paying off loans. This can cause friendships and relationships to be torn apart, which can spur a person to seek anonymity. Mr Kurland says he sees both sides of the privacy argument. \"The lottery is a business so they want to sell tickets, they want to put a face to the win,\" he said. \"And the public wants to see that the person who wins maybe looks like them or comes from humble means. It adds a needed legitimacy to the game.\" Though it still remains to be seen whether or not the New Hampshire winner will have to come forward with her identity, her lawyer insists that in the meantime she intends to keep distributing money to charities. \"She knows there are so many charities that do good work and need money, but we want to start with these two\", Shaheen said. \"She believes that if we raise good children we will have a good country.\" ",

Why is Mr Trump doing this?\nMr Trump says he aims to protect the American worker - and he promised in his campaign that he would rebuild the steel and aluminium industries. The two metals are \"the bedrock of our defence-industrial base\", the president said on Thursday. The industry has been \"ravaged\" by aggressive foreign trade practices that are \"an assault on our country\", the president said. He is also making a political decision, aiming to appeal to blue-collar voters in states such as Pennsylvania - voters who turned away from the Democrats to support Mr Trump in 2016. The president says the US's trade deficit is due to \"very stupid\" deals and policies. We are on the losing side of almost all trade deals. Our friends and enemies have taken advantage of the U.S. for many years. Our Steel and Aluminum industries are dead. Sorry, it\u2019s time for a change! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump What has been the fall-out?\nMr Trump's announcement last week about his plan to impose the hefty tariffs sparked alarm and upset markets at home and abroad. Major trading partners have threatened retaliation and the plans are opposed by many in his own party. Mr Trump has said that the US would \"win big\" in a trade war. Other countries are likely to take the US to court, arguing that the decision violates World Trade Organization moves. The White House says that the national security rationale for the move is \"unassailable\" and national security considerations are allowed under WTO rules. What happens now?\nAnalysis by Natalie Sherman, BBC News business reporter, New York President Trump made clear on Wednesday he will consider exemptions to the tariffs. The move invites lobbying from other countries and could quiet critics who say his actions will lead to a trade war. Will Mr Trump's approach, which the White House has described as \"flexible\", mean this proves to be another announcement stronger on rhetoric than substance? We don't know yet. The White House has said exemptions will be granted to nations that offer other ways to resolve his concerns about national and economic security. The strategy has raised objections from at least one Republican. But should countries want to talk, that provides Mr Trump the opportunity to revisit a host of issues near and dear to his heart, including a wall along the Mexican border, barriers to US goods in countries like Germany and South Korea - even US contributions to security organisations like Nato. Mr Trump, who casts himself as the ultimate negotiator, is opening the door to more of the deal-making he appears to relish. ",

The Saracens playmaker will deputise for injured hooker Dylan Hartley in the Six Nations match in Paris (16:45 GMT). England are five points behind leaders Ireland, after a comprehensive defeat by Scotland in their last outing. Jones says he wants Farrell to be his usual \"aggressive and passionate\" self. \"It's an opportunity for him to show he is capable of being a captain in the future,\" the Australian told BBC Sport. \"His first job is to be the best player on the field - and for him to be the best player on the field he needs to be aggressive and he needs to be in their face.\" Jones feels Farrell's leadership potential has grown rapidly over the past year, with the player regularly stepping in for Hartley at the end of games. \"The last 12 months he has accelerated in that area and taken a real interest in it,\" the head coach added. \"We know he is a straight-shooter. He's up front and an intense player, but he has added a tactical understanding to his game, and his work off the field with the players has been very impressive.\" Farrell himself has reflected on the \"massive honour\" of leading the side, but insists his first job is to lead by example. \"I think that's what a lot of leadership is about,\" Farrell told BBC Sport. \"You can't be asking people to do things you're not willing to do yourself. You have to get your own stuff right and then hopefully [others] will follow you then.\" The 26-year-old says his famed robust streak has been channelled in the wrong way in the past, but feels he has now matured to be \"calm and clear-headed\". \"It's something that I figured out a while ago now,\" he added. \"That's somewhere I have probably matured a bit over the years - but at the same time you try and be aggressive at the right times. \"I don't think anybody goes onto the pitch and wants to go backwards.\" ",

The teenager allegedly pulled over a car, and after \"obtaining the female's information he gave her a warning and let her go\", California police said. He also allegedly visited two homes, claiming to be responding to a domestic disturbance call. He was later detained while driving a vehicle owned by his great grandmother. The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said the teenager, who has not been identified due to his age, had mounted red and blue flashing lights to the windscreen of his great-grandmother's Ford Explorer SUV and wore what appeared to be a real handgun. He was arrested on Tuesday at the High Desert Juvenile Detention Center, according to the Victorville Police Department. In addition to stopping at least one driver on Monday night, the boy also allegedly visited a home and told its owner he there to investigate a \"reported domestic disturbance,\" according to a police press release. The boy was told there had been no call, and then tried to open the locked door after homeowner had closed it on him, according to police. \"For me, I was like, 'That's not normal. Do cops do that?'\" Jasmine Jones, who lives at the residence, told KTLA-News. \"I saw the police uniform and I thought, 'That just doesn't look right,'\" she said. \"It's loose, and the belt buckle isn't staying on his hips.\" He also allegedly visited another home and activated his lights, causing a 16-year-old boy to leave his home. He again claimed to be investigating a domestic disturbance and left after being informed there had not been a call, police said. During a later search of the boy's home, investigators said they discovered a San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department uniform he allegedly wore. Detectives also found \"a large amount of counterfeit money, simulations firearms, ballistic vests, and other law enforcement related items\". The boy was already on probation, and has now been booked into the High Desert Juvenile Detention Center. ",

Frances and Derek Baars, who describe themselves as a Christian couple, said they would host an Easter egg hunt, but did not plan to address the bunny. The agency then removed the children, aged three and five, and closed the couple's foster home. The couple sued the Children's Aid Society (CAS) as a result. \"There is ample evidence to support the fact that the children were removed because the Baars refused to either tell or imply that the Easter Bunny was delivering chocolate to the Baars' home.\" Justice Andrew Goodman wrote in a decision released on Tuesday. \"I am more than satisfied that the society actions interfered substantially with the Baars' religious beliefs.\" As devout Reformed Presbyterians, Derek and Frances Baars said they did not believe in celebrating Halloween or lying about Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny. CAS support worker Tracey Lindsay acknowledged that the girls were well cared for, CTV News reported. The CAS contended Ms Lindsay \"never asked (the Baars) to lie or betray their faith\". But the Baars argue she told them it was their duty as foster parents to teach the children about the Easter Bunny, according to court documents. More like this:\nFor Easter, the couple told their case worker that they would buy the girls Easter dresses and hide chocolate eggs around the house. Their one sticking point was that they would not say the Easter Bunny was real. In late February 2016, the couple said their case worker told them that the girls would be taken away and their foster home permanently closed if the Baars refused to proactively confirm that the Easter Bunny existed. As a compromise, the couple said the girls could celebrate Easter with another foster family. But the girls were instead taken away and the couple were barred from becoming foster parents in the future. Justice Goodman found the couple celebrated Christmas with the girls, bought them presents and and shared photos of the holiday with their mum. The couple's record has now been cleared and they are allowed to become foster parents or adopt in the future. \"We are very thankful for it, that we've been vindicated. Our names have been cleared and we don't have that hanging over us anymore,\" Mrs Baars told the National Post. Dominic Verticchio, executive director of the Hamilton CAS, apologised to the couple through the newspaper. \"We recognise what our mistakes were,\" he said. \"We respect the decision of the court\u2026 and we have to ensure it doesn't happen again.\" ",

        "content": "President Trump has signed controversial orders imposing heavy tariffs on steel and aluminium - but some countries will be spared. Mr Trump has said the US is suffering from \"unfair trade\" and that the move would boost US industry. But countries have expressed outrage at his plans, and experts have warned of new trade wars. The tariffs will go into effect in 15 days and include exemptions for Canada and Mexico. Tariffs of 25% are to be placed on steel and 10% on aluminium imported into the US. The tariffs are opposed by many in the president's own party and by the US's major trading partners. Republican Senator Jeff Flake - a prominent critic of Mr Trump who opposes the move - said he was drafting legislation to nullify the tariffs, saying trade wars are only ever lost. House Speaker Paul Ryan said he disagreed with the action and feared its unintended consequences. Steel and aluminium workers were at the signing. Mr Trump praised them as \"the backbone of America\" - and alluded to their role in his election. He said such workers had been betrayed - but that was now over and he was delivering on a campaign promise. The president said the tariffs would defend America's national security. What exemptions will there be from the new tariffs?\nThey will apply to all countries except Canada and Mexico, which will be exempt while discussions over the North America Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) take place. There are provisions within the documents for other countries to get exemptions. \"We are going to be very fair, we're going to be very flexible,\" Mr Trump said earlier on Thursday. He also praised his country's close relationship and trade surplus with Australia, saying \"we'll be doing something with them\". The president linked defence spending to trade, and said the US \"subsidised many countries\" in the military. He said there would be a reduction in tariffs for countries that \"treat us fairly\", but said \"many of the countries that treat us the worst on trade and on military are our allies\", singling out Germany for criticism in his earlier comments. Why is Mr Trump doing this?\nMr Trump says he aims to protect the American worker - and he promised in his campaign that he would rebuild the steel and aluminium industries. The two metals are \"the bedrock of our defence-industrial base\", the president said on Thursday. The industry has been \"ravaged\" by aggressive foreign trade practices that are \"an assault on our country\", the president said. He is also making a political decision, aiming to appeal to blue-collar voters in states such as Pennsylvania - voters who turned away from the Democrats to support Mr Trump in 2016. The president says the US's trade deficit is due to \"very stupid\" deals and policies. What has been the fall-out?\nMr Trump's announcement last week about his plan to impose the hefty tariffs sparked alarm and upset markets at home and abroad. Major trading partners have threatened retaliation and the plans are opposed by many in his own party. Mr Trump has said that the US would \"win big\" in a trade war. Other countries are likely to take the US to court, arguing that the decision violates World Trade Organization moves. The White House says that the national security rationale for the move is \"unassailable\" and national security considerations are allowed under WTO rules. The director of UK Steel said the tariffs would have a profound and detrimental impact on the UK steel sector. \"Imposing such measures on US allies in the name of national security is difficult to comprehend,\" Gareth Stace added. What happens now?\nAnalysis by Natalie Sherman, BBC News business reporter, New York President Trump made clear on Wednesday he will consider exemptions to the tariffs. The move invites lobbying from other countries and could quiet critics who say his actions will lead to a trade war. Will Mr Trump's approach, which the White House has described as \"flexible\", mean this proves to be another announcement stronger on rhetoric than substance? We don't know yet. The White House has said exemptions will be granted to nations that offer other ways to resolve his concerns about national and economic security. The strategy has raised objections from at least one Republican. But should countries want to talk, that provides Mr Trump the opportunity to revisit a host of issues near and dear to his heart, including a wall along the Mexican border, barriers to US goods in countries like Germany and South Korea - even US contributions to security organisations like Nato. Mr Trump, who casts himself as the ultimate negotiator, is opening the door to more of the deal-making he appears to relish. ",

        "content": "Arsenal put their recent problems to one side as a polished performance at fallen giants AC Milan gave them the upper hand in their Europa League last-16 tie. The Gunners arrived at the San Siro at arguably the lowest point of manager Arsene Wenger's 22-year reign, yet responded to a run of four straight defeats with a confident and controlled display against their Italian hosts. Henrikh Mkhitaryan's first goal for the club put the Premier League side ahead, cutting in from the left to fire in with the aid of a deflection off Milan skipper Leonardo Bonucci. Wenger spoke before the game about his team showing fight without compromising their attacking principles - and they delivered in a dominant first-half performance. Aaron Ramsey deservedly doubled their lead before half-time, collecting Mesut Ozil's piercing pass through the centre of Milan's defence to round keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma and tap in. Milan tried to up the tempo after the break, wasting a clear early chance to pull one back when Giacomo Bonaventura spooned over the bar. But Arsenal were largely unruffled from then on, limiting the home side to half chances with a solid defensive effort. The two away goals now make the Gunners firm favourites to reach the quarter-finals after next Thursday's second leg at Emirates Stadium. \"Overall it is important to win, but it is not qualification. We have to finish the job at home. I am happy with the spirit and response we gave,\" said Wenger. \"We were not in a position to take risks, but we could not be too cautious as you lose fluidity. We defended with resilience until the end.\" Arsenal travelled to Italy looking for respite from a torrid recent run during which the north London club have lost four straight games for the first time since October 2002. A toxic atmosphere has been hanging over the club as fans continue to turn against Wenger, with 88% of the Arsenal Supporters' Trust's (AST) 1,000 members voting this week in favour of the 68-year-old Frenchman's contract being terminated at the end of the season. Few of the 2,000 or so Gunners fans who travelled to the San Siro would have been confident of seeing a positive performance. But they watched a display containing commitment and organisation - two qualities sorely lacking in recent weeks - against a Milan side revitalised under Gennaro Gattuso. Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck led the line superbly with his tireless running, allowing Ozil, Mkhitaryan and Ramsey to find space from deeper positions when the team attacked. And defensively, they worked hard as a unit - marshalled by skipper Laurent Koscielny - to deny Milan space in attacking areas. Arsenal's problems are not going to be masked by one good result. However, their display could not help but give the impression that, even in their lowest moments, it would be foolish to write off their chances of somehow going on to win the Europa League and secure a route back into the Champions League. Seven-time European champions Milan are a shadow of the force they once were, languishing in seventh place in Serie A despite spending more than \u00a3200m last summer in a bid to change their fortunes. However, they went into Arsenal's visit on a crest of a wave following the arrival of former midfielder Gattuso. He has transformed their season since replacing the sacked Vincenzo Montella in November, leading them on a 13-match unbeaten run and giving them faint hope of climbing into Serie A's European qualification places. Therefore, there was optimism among the 70,000 Rossoneri fans inside the atmospheric San Siro that Gattuso's side could make a huge statement in front of a bigger European audience. It seemed justified as they pinned Arsenal back in the opening few minutes - but that was as difficult as it got for the Gunners. Arsenal quickly wrestled their way back into the game, their passing and movement causing uncertainty in the Milan defence and their solidity seeing the home attack quickly run out of ideas. \"We made too many mistakes,\" said Gattuso. \"We never played as a compact team and they deserved the win. \"Every time they attacked, they could have scored. Playing at this level is something new for our lads but there were too many mistakes. \"In football, you never say never. We'll go to London to try and win, we're not going on an excursion.\" While Koscielny, Ramsey and Ozil all had strong cases to be named man of the match, Mkhitaryan shaded it after producing one of his best performances in an Arsenal shirt. The Armenia international has showed few flashes of brilliance since arriving from Manchester United in January, but demonstrated his quality in a competition where he has thrived since moving to England. While Mkhitaryan struggled to make an impact in the Premier League for United last season, he scored six goals - including one in the final - as the Old Trafford club won the Europa League. In the San Siro, he had already been giving young Milan right-back Davide Calabria a torrid time before putting Arsenal on the path to victory with his first goal for the Gunners. He should have scored a second, clipping the crossbar shortly before Ramsey doubled the lead. Nevertheless, Mkhitaryan's performance offered encouragement to the travelling fans who will want to see him produce similar displays on a more regular basis. Back to the Premier League for sixth-placed Arsenal. The Gunners, who are 13 points adrift of fourth-placed Tottenham, host mid-table Watford at the Emirates on Sunday (13:30 GMT).

        "content": "The largest ever Winter Paralympics will officially begin on Friday with the opening ceremony in Pyeongchang, South Korea. A record 567 athletes from 48 countries, plus the 'neutral Paralympic athlete' delegation, will take part. There will be 80 medals awarded in six sports - alpine skiing, snowboarding, Para-ice hockey, wheelchair curling and the nordic skiing disciplines of cross country and biathlon. The ceremony starts at 11:00 GMT. The sporting action will begin with the men's and women's downhill skiing events from 00:30 GMT on Saturday. North Korea will be making their Winter Paralympics debut, with two athletes in the cross country skiing, but unlike in the Olympics, where North and South Korean athletes marched at the opening ceremony under a unified flag, the two nations will remain separate for the Paralympics ceremony. \"Although we are disappointed, we respect the decision of the two NPCs who decided that marching separately would be better for both parties,\" said International Paralympic Committee president Andrew Parsons. \"During discussions it was clear that the North Korea National Paralympic Committee respects and values the IPC's vision and mission. \"At the end of the meeting both NPCs recognised that their participation in Pyeongchang 2018 has brought them closer together, and the two have committed to working more closely together in the future.\" Georgia and Tajikistan will also make their Winter Games debuts, while the USA will have the largest team with 68 athletes. Russian athletes will be in attendance but will compete under as 'neutral Paralympic athletes' (NPA), after the nation was banned following a report which found evidence of state-sponsored doping. Snowboarder Owen Pick, a former soldier who had his leg amputated after being injured in Afghanistan, will carry the British flag into the Olympic Stadium - this will be the first Games at which GB have had representation in snowboarding. The 35,000-capacity Olympic Stadium was built for last month's Winter Olympics and the Winter Paralympics at a cost of $106m (\u00a376m) and will be pulled down having hosted four events - the opening and closing ceremonies of both Games. The space left by the pentagonal-shaped arena, which has been modified since the Olympics closing ceremony to allow greater access for disabled athletes, will be used for culture and sports. Media playback is not supported on this device Under the tag line 'passion moves us', organisers say the opening ceremony will \"embody the new world of co-existence\". Nations will enter the arena in order of the Korean alphabet, before the Paralympic flame enters the stadium and lights a \"moon-shaped\" cauldron. There will also be a speech from South Korea president Moon Jae-in. Britain's 17-strong team is the country's biggest at a Winter Paralympics since Turin 2006, when 20 athletes took part, including a Para-ice hockey team. GB will be represented in five sports - alpine skiing, snowboard, wheelchair curling and the two nordic skiing disciplines of biathlon and cross country. Scott Meenagh will be the first British athlete to compete in nordic skiing at a Paralympics in 20 years. Four years ago in Sochi, GB took home six medals, their highest tally for 30 years. There was gold for Kelly Gallagher and guide Charlotte Evans in the super G, a wheelchair curling bronze, plus four skiing medals in the visually impaired category for Jade Etherington, who retired after the Games, and her guide Caroline Powell. The target for GB at Pyeongchang is to win between six and 12 medals, with an ambition of at least seven. If achieved, it would be their second-highest medal haul after the 10 at Innsbruck, Austria, in 1984 and their best since National Lottery funding began in 1997. \"It is quite a lot, and it's also a really tough target,\" said ParalympicsGB's chef de mission Penny Briscoe. \"Not that we should be daunted by that, because obviously investment is linked to performance. And the increased investment post-Sochi means that we're hoping that will have had a positive impact on the preparation of the athletes.\" Gallagher, with guide Gary Smith, will compete in four of the five alpine skiing disciplines, and will defend her super G title, but is coming in off an injury-hit 2017. She will be joined in the visually impaired classification by teenagers Menna Fitzpatrick (guided by Jennifer Kehoe) and Millie Knight (guided by Brett Wild). The pair, both 19, will begin the British interest on Saturday when they compete in the downhill at 00:30 GMT and will carry GB's greatest medal prospect, along with Gallagher, on the alpine slopes. Fitzpatrick was the first Briton to become overall IPC World Cup champion in 2016 and Knight took gold among four individual medals at the 2017 World Championships. GB will have snowboard interest at a Paralympics for the first time, after the sport's introduction four years ago, with James Barnes-Miller and Ben Moore in the upper-limb impairment classification and flagbearer Pick in the lower-limb classification. All three will race in snowboard cross on Monday and banked slalom on Friday, and have outside chances of medals after all registered top-10 finishes at the most recent World Championships. Four of the five members of the 2014 bronze medal-winning wheelchair curling team, skipped by Aileen Neilson, will return in the hope of a repeated medal success. The line-up of Neilson, Gregor Ewan, Hugh Nibloe, Bob McPherson and Angie Malone won bronze at the 2017 World Championships at the same venue in which they will start their Paralympic Games campaign against world champions Norway on Saturday. As with the Winter Olympics last month, Russian athletes who are deemed to be clean by the International Paralympic Committee will be able to compete as neutrals. The Russian Paralympic Committee remains suspended after a report found evidence of state-sponsored doping. Around 30 Russian athletes, all of whom must have had at least two anti-doping tests in the past six months, are expected to compete across alpine skiing, biathlon, cross country, snowboard and wheelchair curling. That is compared with 68 athletes at Sochi, where Russia topped the medal table with a record total of 80. Briscoe said the British Paralympic Association feels \"comfortable\" with the inclusion of Russian athletes at the Games. \"The IPC took a strong position regarding Russia in 2016,\" she said. \"Some progress has been made but not as much as needs to be. \"Strategically, the IPC has made a very good decision by allowing athletes who can demonstrate they are clean to compete in the Games. We hope eventually that NPC Russia can compete as part of the Paralympic family.\" Temperatures in Pyeongchang are not as low as they were for the Olympics last month, sitting at about freezing. That could even reach 10C by the closing ceremony on Sunday 18 March - although it could drop to -7C for the opening ceremony. However, snowfall since the end of the Olympics and further snowfall on Thursday could cause problems. Alpine training at the Jeongseon Alpine Centre was cancelled on Wednesday because of low visibility and on Thursday because of snowfall, while Friday's session has also been postponed. IPC president Parsons told BBC Sport on Thursday: \"We have a lot of snow today so we will have to see how that affects the opening ceremony, which is outdoors. \"We have been working closely with the organising committee but when it comes to the skiing we have to see how it goes - and see about the quality and how much snow we have. But we have experienced officials on the ground to make the right decisions. \"We are not worried about fitting everything in - there are plans in place.\" ",

        "content": "Critics may carp that Donald Trump skipped economics class, like a certain 1980s movie truant. But as the 45th president himself notes, Abraham Lincoln and other historic Republican leaders loved tariffs. \"This bill is an American bill. It is made for the American people and for American interests.\" That sounds like President Trump. But it's William McKinley - another \"America First\" Republican president - on his Tariff Act of 1890. When McKinley slapped high duties on US imports, some fellow conservatives thought the powerful Ohio congressman dubbed the \"Napoleon of Protection\" had gone too far. \"It is the most shameful measure ever proposed to a civilised people,\" fumed Secretary of State James Blaine. \"Go on with it and it will carry our nation to perdition.\" White House economic adviser Gary Cohn might well echo that view in regard to current policy. Cohn, a Democrat, is to quit after losing a battle against Trump's tariff. Congressional Republicans are also imploring the president to drop the plan. But despite the outcry, Trump has pointed out that raising the economic drawbridge is thoroughly in keeping with his party's historical roots. It wasn't just McKinley who believed protectionism key to American greatness. Tariffs were the Republican creed from the Civil War to the Great Depression, and a fundamental doctrine of its preceding party, the Whigs. Going even further back, the first US Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, now a Broadway musical hero, pioneered tariffs to protect infant American industries from foreign competition. So did fellow Founding Father James Madison. Charles Hankla, professor of political science at Georgia State University, says Republicans from the mid-19th Century onwards continued to champion such a fiscal firewall so northern manufacturers could compete with European imports. Democrats, he says, espoused free trade as they were aligned with southern slave-owning plantations that exported cotton to British mills. It was Abraham Lincoln who inaugurated the Republican party's economic nationalism. Yes, the Great Emancipator was also the Great Protectionist. \"Give us a protective tariff and we will have the greatest nation on earth,\" he said in 1844. While Trump is sometimes accused of economic illiteracy, Abe himself once apparently exhibited a flimsy grasp of his pet policy while campaigning for Congress in Illinois. Tariffs would only be collected from \"those whose pride, whose abundance of means, prompt them to spurn the manufacturers of our own country and strut in British cloaks and coats and pantaloons\", he insisted, according to a biography of him by David Herbert Donald. A journalist challenged Lincoln on the stump to explain why he thought these duties would make everything cheaper for farmers. The candidate is said to have replied that he \"could not tell the reason, but it was so\". Theodore Roosevelt was another Republican president who extolled tariffs as a buttress to American power, according to a biography of him by Edmund Morris. In 1895, the Rough Rider wrote: \"In this country pernicious indulgence in the doctrine of free trade seems inevitably to produce fatty degeneration of the moral fibre.\" Despite protectionism's naysayers, the Gilded Age was one of fabulous prosperity. Political scientists still debate whether the boom was helped or hindered by all those import taxes. It took two worlds wars and an international economic cataclysm in the first half of the 20th Century to convert conservatives to free trade. Heather Cox Richardson, author of To Make Men Free: a History of the Republican Party, says: \"All of the people coming out of the [Great] Depression and World War Two are terrified of starting that again. \"So Republicans and Democrats actually begin to look very much alike in terms of their economic policies.\" In the 1950s, Republican President Dwight Eisenhower unabashedly touted free trade as a means to bind the West together in a bulwark against communism. By doing so, he ushered in the modern era of globalisation. Every Republican leader since has been a pragmatic free trader, even if the siren song of populism has at times proved too potent to resist. Richard Nixon experimented with duties on US imports. Ronald Reagan slapped a tariff on Japanese motorcycles. George W Bush targeted steel imports, only to back down after the World Trade Organization threatened sanctions. Bush's trade debacle confirmed the worst fears of many grassroots conservatives. Some Republicans have remained deeply suspicious of multilateral agreements since the aftermath of World War One, says Richardson, a history professor at Boston College. They fretted that these pacts would establish \"One World Order, that free traders were going to destroy America by letting foreigners come in and call the shots\". \"There was also resentment among people who believed they were being left behind in the post-World War Two order,\" she adds. \"And that is the concept Donald Trump capitalised on.\" One result of Trump's recent policy is that a notorious 1930 trade law - remembered in popular culture for its amusing cameo in a cinema classic - is back in the spotlight. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, a Republican measure that imposed hundreds of US import duties, is generally agreed to have worsened the Great Depression. In the 1986 movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off, this bill is the subject of a lecture to catatonically bored high school students. The film's hero - an affluent child of Reagan's Morning in America - had skipped class. Trump's critics argue that he has not learned the lesson of Smoot-Hawley either. They warn he risks reigniting the beggar-thy-neighbour trade wars waged amid the ruination of the global economy nine decades ago. The multi-billion dollar question is, when and where will Trump's tariff end? It's anyone's guess. Or as Ferris Bueller's monotonous teacher would say: \"Anyone? Anyone?\" ",

Frances and Derek Baars, a religious Christian couple, said they would host an Easter egg hunt, but that was not enough to satisfy their case worker. The agency removed the children, aged three and five, closed their foster home, and barred future adoptions. The couple sued the Children's Aid Society (CAS) as a result. The CAS, which receives taxpayer funding, provides child protection services on behalf of the province. The non-governmental organisation has frequently been criticised, and some - including those featured in 2011 documentary \"Powerful As God\" - have argued it wields too much power. Justice Andrew Goodman wrote in a scathing decision released on Tuesday: \"There is ample evidence to support the fact that the children were removed because the Baars refused to either tell or imply that the Easter Bunny was delivering chocolate to the Baars' home. \"I am more than satisfied that the society actions interfered substantially with the Baars' religious beliefs.\" As devout Reformed Presbyterians, Derek and Frances Baars said they did not believe in celebrating Halloween or lying about Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny. CAS support worker Tracey Lindsay acknowledged that the girls were well cared for, CTV News reported. The CAS contended Ms Lindsay \"never asked (the Baars) to lie or betray their faith\". But the Baars argue she told them it was their duty as foster parents to teach the children about the Easter Bunny, according to court documents. More like this:\nFor Easter, the couple told their case worker that they would buy the girls Easter dresses and hide chocolate eggs around the house. Their one sticking point was that they would not say the Easter Bunny was real. In late February 2016, the couple said their case worker told them that the girls would be taken away and their foster home permanently closed if the Baars refused to proactively confirm that the Easter Bunny existed. As a compromise, the couple said the girls could celebrate Easter with another foster family. But the girls were instead taken away and the couple were barred from becoming foster parents in the future. Justice Goodman found the couple celebrated Christmas with the girls, bought them presents and and shared photos of the holiday with their mum. The couple's record has now been cleared and they are allowed to become foster parents or adopt in the future. \"We are very thankful for it, that we've been vindicated. Our names have been cleared and we don't have that hanging over us anymore,\" Mrs Baars told the National Post. Dominic Verticchio, executive director of the Hamilton CAS, apologised to the couple through the newspaper. \"We recognise what our mistakes were,\" he said. \"We respect the decision of the court\u2026 and we have to ensure it doesn't happen again.\" ",

        "content": "Shares in Countrywide, the UK's largest estate agent group, lost 20% after it warned of tough times in the market. Countrywide, whose brands include Bairstow Eves and Gascoigne Pees, made a \u00a3208.1m after-tax loss in 2017, versus a \u00a317.5m profit in 2016. said about 150 head office jobs would go. The firm has been hit by a slowdown in the housing market as well as the rise of online agents such as Purplebricks. But by the close, the shares had pulled back to stand 1.6% down. The profit figures were also dragged lower by one-off costs as Countrywide continued to restructure the business. But even with these are stripped out, pre-tax profits more than halved to \u00a325.2m, from \u00a352.7m in 2016. Countrywide, which called 2017 \"a disappointing year\", said trading had remained under pressure since the start of 2018 with a pipeline of work \"significantly\" below a year earlier. Cost-cutting drive\nIts previous chief executive, Alison Platt, left last month after a profit warning and announcement of a further restructuring of the business which included investment in digital operations to compete with online rivals. Countrywide said on Thursday that it was shedding about 150 of its 450-strong head office team as part of a cost-cutting drive. The firm employs about 8,000 nationwide. The results announcement laid bare the problems in its core sales and lettings arm, where earnings sank 47% to \u00a314.9m. Across sales and lettings in London, earnings fell 44% to \u00a311.5m. Executive chairman Peter Long admitted that the patience of investors had been \"sorely tested\". The company will not be paying a dividend to shareholders. He said the group was working to resolve poor performance in sales and lettings, but admitted it would \"take time\". \"We believe these business units are fixable, know what we have to do to restore them and the steps to take that should result in a return to profitable growth.\" Some of the problems facing the housing sector were underlined on Thursday with news that the number of homes on estate agents' books had dwindled to a new low. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said average property stock levels per branch on agents' books fell to a new record low of just under 42, as inquiries from new buyers, new instructions from sellers and newly-agreed sales continued to drift lower in February. New buyer inquiries fell for the 11th month in a row, while sales trends have remained similar over the past six months, Rics said. Where can you afford to live?

        "content": "Warning: this report includes strong language There is a bullying and sexual harassment problem at the House of Commons. Women face greater obstacles holding jobs in the engine room of our democracy than men. It is a problem that runs from the most obscure of backbench committee rooms through to the most senior of MPs. The topic raises questions not just about the conduct of members and the processes of the House - but also about John Bercow, the Speaker of the House, himself. One woman, who has now left the House, told us: \"My career at the House of Commons didn't end when I was sexually harassed. My career ended when I complained.\" Another, still in post, told us there was a \"culture of fear\" in the House, as people worry that, if something happens, they will not be looked after. After dozens of interviews with House current and departed staff, it is clear that a large number of staff members - women, in particular - feel they have no protection from the small minority of MPs who might harass, bully or wish to take advantage of them. After reviewing hundreds of pages of internal parliamentary HR documents, it is clear the House has an unusual approach to managing personnel. The group of people that Newsnight has focussed on are people who do not get much attention. Whenever the House of Commons works, so does a team of unacknowledged officials who work directly for parliament - not any member or party. Their job is to keep our democracy fair and open. This cadre, who work for the House of Commons, have a host of titles such as \"secretary\" and \"inquiry manager\". But, to other people in Westminster, most of this group of people are known by the title that is, strictly speaking, held by only the most senior among them: the \"clerks\". They quietly advise MPs on committees, and advise the Speaker of the House on procedure. Their role is more important than is commonly appreciated. You can easily spot a few wearing wigs in the chamber on special occasions. They are not civil servants, because they work for the House - not the government. These officials are easy prey for MPs, in particular, who decide to harass or bully them. It is a place where women, in particular, struggle to stay the course. While some men get bullied, one woman told us that it was a problem that was \"90 per cent\" women - an assessment that other people in the House agree with. Since 2011, there has been a process to protect them from MPs - the \"Respect\" policy has been in place - but staff have no confidence in it. Women are bullied more and harassed more by male MPs. And if these women complain, they are certain their careers will suffer. Our legislature - the core of our public life - is a place where talented women are more likely to try to move on to other things, where their impact on our public life will almost certainly be smaller. One woman said: \"All I wanted was to do my job without being humiliated. There are no incentives for people to raise issues.\" Another said: \"I was bullied out of a job I loved. The MPs were one thing, but I felt so badly let down by the people I worked with directly.\" The clerks\nClerks occupy a strange space. They work with MPs, whose authority comes from being elected by the public. And if the MPs work on committees, they are there with a double authority: their positions on committees comes from other MPs voting them onto them. As a result, when there are workplace problems, there is an inequality in their roles. Hannah White, who worked as a clerk from 2004 to 2014, said \"From the day that you start working in the House of Commons \u2026..there can be situations where you're required to deliver difficult messages and in those circumstances it's seen as very important to be robust.\" That is the root of this problem. There is culture among clerks that prizes \"resilience\". You cannot easily deal with an MP who is unreasonable, so the ideal clerk will be able to cope. They will be \"thick-skinned\" and have a \"stiff upper lip\". But, as Ms White says, \"The difficulty is when that extends to when a member behaves inappropriately towards you- you're still expected to just put up with that situation.\" This is a culture that contains none of the normal feedback mechanisms that correct workplace behaviour. Clerks put up with actions by MPs that would be deemed unacceptable in any other context. And that allows behaviour to escalate from thoughtlessness into something worse. On trips abroad, women clerks have told us they have been advised not to accept drinks with MPs. Go to bed promptly. Do not let them in your room. Do not enter theirs. And younger women, in particular, are at risk. The prevalent attitude is that, as a clerk, if you complain about an MP, your career is likely to suffer. Not theirs. You may be referred to courses on dealing with \"difficult\" people. Women have told us how, even if you have been subjected to significant workplace bullying or sexual harassment, you risk being seen as \"sensitive\" or a \"troublemaker\" if you complain. Our research points to a particular problem: that, if the House accepts there is a real issue, the usual solution is to move the clerk - not the MP. A current clerk told us: \"There is still a fear about people speaking out because there are recent examples where people end up getting moved or leaving the House in relation to raising these things\u2026 .\" That can be distressing for people who enjoy working with their current team. But it can also mean that people's workplace progression is slowed. It places a particular burden on clerks who have built a specialism that can only be deployed on one committee. Careers suffering\nThe problem of women suffering for complaining was a continual refrain from the clerks we interviewed. We spoke to one woman who described being sexually assaulted by an MP in the 1990s, when she was about 20. She was delivering papers to him in his office one evening. She said: \"He manoeuvred me out of his office into the corridor and put his arm around me and kissed me. I can remember trying to fight him off. I was trying to reel back to stop him from reaching me, but it didn't stop him. I told my line manager and nothing happened, so I just left it.\" This is not an unfamiliar complaint. Women working in the house have told us about being pushed against walls, forcibly kissed, groped and slapped by MPs much more recently. One woman told us about how she, a keen baker, had made a birthday cake for a colleague. She was applying the icing, when an MP entered the room. \"I was kneeling, putting the finishing touches on the cake. He came in and stood right over me. I remember he was overbearingly close. He said 'right where you belong. On your knees with a face full of chocolate.' It was so humiliating.\" The response from her manager was to conclude: \"the best course of action would be to move me from that committee. I didn't want to move. I enjoyed my job. I stayed, but the behaviour didn't stop.\" \"After that I did everything I could - I was never alone, my colleagues chaperoned me to events, I dressed differently, as I was told\u2026 I became much blander around MPs...but whatever you do it doesn't stop that feeling in the pit of your stomach the whole time...you never know who is around the next corner, or who is going to get in a lift with you.\" One woman told us: \"When I raised a complaint, I knew full well that I'd be the one that would get moved. Despite the fact I loved my job. Raising complaints had a detrimental impact on my career. On reflection, I think it's why I didn't go as far as I would have liked to.\" Yet another said: \"The lesson I took away was that you shut up. You don't speak up if you have a problem where an MP is concerned. Management would deal with things in a discreet way - which meant telling the person who had been harassed or bullied that they had to do something to change or they would be moved.\" Newsnight has heard accounts from women who regard themselves as being victims of that culture - and some who think they were beneficiaries. We have met women who credit their success to being \"compliant\" and women who credit their lack of advancement to a willingness to make noise. The Honourable Member for the Wrekin\nMark Pritchard, the Tory MP for the Wrekin, is notorious for shouting at and berating clerks. Many we spoke to rolled their eyes at the mention of his name. The bulk of the outbursts we have heard about follow something of a pattern. A clerk will stand up to him, he will fly into a rage, and sometimes complain to their management. The circumstances of a committee trip to California in 2007 are particularly notorious. One witness told us about how he berated a female member of staff.\" He wasn't happy with the hotel choice, he wanted to stay elsewhere. He exploded, yelled at her\u2026\" Another witness explained: \"Pritchard wanted a hotel on Santa Monica beach for the California trip, but the Foreign Office wanted him to stay in downtown LA so travel wasn't involved. He threw his papers about and said something like 'you fucking useless women'\". When they finally went on that trip, a witness told us that Mr Pritchard told one official: \"You stupid young woman, you haven't got a fucking clue what you're talking about. Who the fuck do you think you are?\" We have been told that Mr Pritchard has also sought to approach clerks' managers to attempt to overturn their decisions and angrily boasted to clerks that their careers were over. Mr Pritchard himself told us: \"I understand, over the past several years the House authorities have addressed numerous complaints about MPs, but they have also informed me they have no record of any complaints against me, and if they had, I would have been notified.\" But that brings us back to the core of the issue: staff members are loath to formally complain about any MP. Managers at the House of Commons would note that, since 2011, there has been a formal process for dealing with complaints by staff against MPs - the so-called \"Respect\" policy. But it has faced one stern test - and it came out badly. The Honourable Member for Newcastle under Lyme\nClerks are unanimous about the virtues of Emily Commander, a former clerk. Views on her range from \"a future Clerk of the House\" to \"the best boss I ever had\". We heard praise for ability to deal with the minutiae of a topic, run a team, handle a committee, write a report or deal with MPs. Newsnight has spoken to witnesses who believe that a single member, Paul Farrelly, the Labour MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme, made her continued employment at the House of Commons impossible - a consequence, they say, of years of continued, personal criticism. One witness recalls him singling Ms Commander out when they were working on the Science and Technology Committee in the early 2000s. A fellow participant in a committee trip to Italy in November 2004 session recalled his behaviour vividly. \"He was a complete and utter bully\". \"He wound her up like a screw and reduced her to tears. The more he upset her, the more he enjoyed it, the more he kept turning the screw. He was very aggressive. It felt like no one had the ability or authority to intervene. Everybody knew it was wrong.\" Mr Farrelly says he has no memory of Ms Commander being a clerk on this committee. Mr Farrelly left the Science and Technology committee in July 2005 for the Culture, Media and Sport Committee. But the two had to work together again: in late 2010, Ms Commander became clerk of the CMS Committee. This was a major promotion for her: a committee in the midst of the news. The phone-hacking inquiry was going on. This was the committee to which Rupert Murdoch would soon confess to feeling \"humbled\" - and where he was hit with a foam pie by a protester. Ms Commander's promotion reflected the House's high regard for her. The report she produced was regarded as \"magisterial\" by senior officials. However documents obtained by Newsnight, show that Ms Commander was forced to step away from the committee for her own health a little more than a year later - a development attributed by her managers to Mr Farrelly's behaviour. Emails between staff, obtained by Newsnight, show her complaints were of a campaign of continual belittling and undermining, in front of her MPs and in front of her own staff. Eventually, in the words of a colleague, it reached \"crisis point\". Ms Commander had to step away. One internal document, obtained by Newsnight, contains a summary of her position. She had told her bosses she had \"trouble falling asleep at night\u2026 I have been anxious about encountering Mr Farrelly... I have repeated nightmares about going on Committee visits with Mr Farrelly and being criticised by him for having neglected tiny details... After particularly unpleasant meetings I have lost my appetite and have on several occasions been physically sick.\" A senior clerk, Andrew Kennon, intervened formally in February 2012. Mr Kennon, the clerk in charge of committees, submitted a complaint on her behalf about the MP's behaviour - the first formal complaint about Mr Farrelly. Mr Kennon's requested solution was that Mr Farrelly be removed from the committee and he write a public apology to her. It was a good test case for the House authorities to show that the then-brand-new complaints process, the Respect policy, which took effect in 2011, could work. Evidence sifting\nAs the formal \"Respect\" process started, it was immediately noted that there had been prior incidents involving Mr Farrelly and two other women working as clerks. Those two other women were asked to provide accounts of what happened. The first of these two other women told the House investigation that, on a trip abroad just a few years before, Mr Farrelly had \"begun asking me repeated questions about my marital status, my then fianc\u00e9, wedding plans and other personal matters\u2026 It is always difficult to convey when questions of this nature go beyond a mere friendly interest\u2026 However, on three separate occasions other Members intervened... .\" She added: \"On a number of occasions, I noticed my hands shaking before a meeting of the Committee. I began to sleep very badly and lost my appetite. My husband and friends wanted me to go to the doctor and be signed off with stress.\" She also described how her boss, a senior clerk still working at the House, had told her: \"Mr Farrelly was known to be an awful man, or words to that effect, and that he had previously made the lives of female members of staff... very difficult\". The second of the two additional women was also approached about giving evidence - and gave over her testimony. However, the House authorities decided that \"only behaviour which post-dated the adoption of the Respect policy would fall within the scope of the investigation\". The Respect policy, however, was adopted only on June 20 2011. This investigation was initiated in February 2012. So, despite being presented with evidence stretching back eight years, the House authorities decided that, under their own rules, it could only admit the previous 8 months. Both of the other women's accounts were excluded for being too old - even though some was barely two years old and the oldest was eight. The earlier episodes involving Mr Farrelly and Ms Commander, from the trip to Italy, would also have been inadmissible. The House told Newsnight that this was on the basis of legal advice. Mr Farrelly told Newsnight that the Respect policy \"plainly could not investigate complaints about matters predating that policy\". The inquiry\nUnder the Respect policy, Edward Wood, a House official working in another department, interviewed MPs and staff. The case was soon cast as a battle of wills between staff and MPs. The Wood inquiry found a curious dynamic: staff believed Ms Commander had been bullied, MPs did not. One MP, cited in the judgment, was quite clear about the sense of taking sides: \"I know I'm a member, on the committee, and so on, so I'm not impartial.\". However, another MP was also cited as saying that Mr Farrelly \"does have a tendency to bully\u2026 He can be very impatient very sharp in his comments\". The Wood report does not come to a conclusion on most of the issues raised in the complaints against Mr Farrelly. In the few cases where Mr Wood was able to make a determination, however, it found that Mr Farrelly had, indeed, bullied Ms Commander. While he could not prove that Mr Farrelly had intended to be a bully, his behaviour amounted to \"an abuse of power or position, unfair treatment and undermining a competent worker by constant criticism\u2026 The conduct was offensive and insulting.\" As a next step, the case was referred to the House of Commons Commission, a panel of MPs, met on 26 November 2012 to discuss the report and take action. This group of grandees is chaired by the Speaker, and they organise the running of the House. It was this body, meeting under a different name - the \"Members' Estimate Committee\" - that used to set MPs' pay and expenses. But despite the unequivocal findings of the report, the Commission decided it could not rule that Mr Farrelly had bullied Ms Commander. They found themselves unable to come to a view. They also voted to suspend the Respect policy: they argued that \"investigations were undertaken by a House of Commons official, who might be considered to have an interest; and Members had no right of appeal if a complaint was upheld.\" They regarded the system - where the final judgment lay with MPs and which had never been used to sanction an MP - as loaded against MPs. They also decided that the Respect policy lacked the required legal underpinnings to permit any action, so could take none. (A reformed Respect policy returned in 2014, with MPs still making decisions on reports - but clerks not involved in investigation.) The commission invited Ms Commander and Mr Farrelly to enter mediation: an unusual way to deal with bullying and one that was supposed to be voluntary. But, Newsnight has obtained documents suggesting that, a few weeks later in December 2012, union reps were left with an alarming impression: they had received a warning, transmitted via a senior clerk, that if she did not agree to enter mediation, MPs on the Commission might decide that the investigation was wrong, and she had not been bullied after all. The process petered out. The complaint went away. So did Ms Commander. Her career at the House of Commons was over. She has emigrated. Newsnight has contacted Ms Commander for comment. Andrew Kennon, the senior clerk who pursued this case on her behalf, suffered too. In the short term, Mr Farrelly demanded an investigation into Mr Kennon because, he says, the senior clerk raised his voice to him and told him to \"shut up\". Mr Farrelly told Newsnight he thought this was \"plainly inappropriate\" behaviour meriting an inquiry. But Newsnight has found Mr Kennon's name in the paperwork on a string of other grievances, intervening on behalf of bullied women clerks. He is widely assumed by other clerks to have ended his own career by taking these stands. Any hope of advancement disappeared. He has now retired. Newsnight has contacted Mr Kennon for comment. Mr Farrelly issued a private, though limited, apology to Ms Commander - but it was never published. Mr Farrelly is still on the Culture, Media and Sport Committee. He quizzed BBC executives just a few weeks ago, in January, about gender within the corporation. Mr Farrelly denied any bullying. He told Newsnight: \"In 2012 allegations were made about me having bullied a clerk to the Committee during the compilation of the phone hacking report. These allegations were investigated and not upheld.\" \"Despite this, I apologised if I had inadvertently upset the clerk who had suffered stress. The policy under which they were investigated was considered to be so unfair to those complained about that it was immediately withdrawn and replaced by another policy.\" He told Newsnight that it would, in any case, be inappropriate for MPs to be removed from select committees as a consequence of staff complaints because \"MPs are elected either by the whole House or by their political parties to serve on Committees\". The Speaker\nMr Bercow is still Speaker of the House of Commons. He is a key to fixing the culture of the lower house. But we have found that staff lack confidence in him on this topic. He was intimately involved in the Farrelly case. Furthermore, our interviews have uncovered that he personally has a reputation as a bully with staff. Kate Emms took a job as his private secretary in May 2010. She had to leave in February 2011. She was signed off sick. Her colleagues have told Newsnight it was because of bullying behaviour by Mr Bercow. This is hardly a secret: she was then moved to a different role in the House in May 2011 and the operation of the House had to be modified so she would not have to deal with the Speaker. Her new role was modified so that she would not need to speak to him. It is also no secret that the House authorities were told she had post-traumatic stress disorder. Colleagues of Ms Emms have told us that she was undermined by Mr Bercow in a range of ways - and seemed to shout at her a lot. We have habitually asked serving and recently departed clerks if they would like to take the - very senior - role of being the Speaker's private secretary. Their consistent answer? A clear \"No\". The House has long struggled to get experienced people to work for him - not least because he has shown his temper to other clerks. This episode with Ms Emms also left one bizarre memento. The Speaker's official portrait was commissioned when Ms Emms was in his staff. It was decided that she would be included in the painting. But there was a long gap between her posing for the artist and the unveiling in September 2011. By then, she had been replaced in the painting. In her place, stood her successor. The Speaker's spokesperson said: \"The Speaker completely and utterly refutes the allegation that he behaved in such a manner, either eight years ago, or at any other time. Any suggestion to the contrary is simply untrue.\" They made no comment on the portrait. Where to now?\nWhen we asked about the problems about the Respect policy, the House stated: \"In 2014 the House of Commons introduced the revised Respect policy which is specifically designed to combat bullying and harassment of House employees by MPs or their staff.\" They also introduced \" training for managers on how to address reports of bullying or harassment and a team of trained bullying and harassment contacts for staff to approach should they have concerns.\" But, at the same time, Parliament currently has a working group on bullying and harassment, led by the Leader of the House, which has come to different conclusions. Their work found that: \"The evidence, particularly from staff, was that a change in workplace culture is both urgent and essential, and is ultimately the best guarantor of a change in behaviour.\" When we put it to the House that women had told us of a \"culture of fear\", they described this as a \"grotesque exaggeration\". But the House working group found that people who had experienced bullying, harassment or sexual harassment were less confident than others that a complaint would be dealt with satisfactorily. The Farrelly case also raises a clear question about retrospectivity. Just as the 2011 version of the Respect policy was used to exclude prior events, clerks fear the ongoing reform efforts will be, too. And it will remain the case that MPs - this time, on the Standards Committee - will be the decision-makers on what course of action should be taken. A system that operates in private is also unlikely to be trusted. It is the case that MPs are appointed in a unique way: they are elected and paid by the public. But, at the moment, the only people who can fire them are not allowed to know about their professional conduct. Ultimately, staff feel that the system which determines sanctions for MPs must be run externally. MPs will resist that. But it used to be thought unthinkable that MPs' expenses and pay could ever be run by an external body. And it is now. There also needs to be a marked change in culture. That may be hardest of all. Even a robust system will fail if the clerks continue to believe that their managers think victims should be moved and not heard. ",

        "content": "President Trump has signed controversial orders imposing heavy tariffs on steel and aluminium - but some countries will be spared. Mr Trump has said the US is suffering from \"unfair trade\" and that the move would boost US industry. But countries have expressed outrage at his plans, and experts have warned of new trade wars. The tariffs will go into effect in 15 days and include exemptions for Canada and Mexico. Tariffs of 25% are to be placed on steel and 10% on aluminium imported into the US. The tariffs are opposed by many in the president's own party and by the US's major trading partners. Republican Senator Jeff Flake - a prominent critic of Mr Trump who opposes the move - said he was drafting legislation to nullify the tariffs, saying trade wars are only ever lost. House Speaker Paul Ryan said he disagreed with the action and feared its unintended consequences. What has the international reaction been?\nOn tonight\u2019s announcement - the EU is a close ally of the US and we continue to be of the view that the EU should be excluded from these measures. I will seek more clarity on this issue in the days to come. Looking forward to meeting USTR Lighthizer in Brussels on Sat to discuss. End of Twitter post by @MalmstromEU Steel and aluminium workers were at the signing. Mr Trump praised them as \"the backbone of America\" - and alluded to their role in his election. He said such workers had been betrayed - but that was now over and he was delivering on a campaign promise. The president said the tariffs would defend America's national security. What exemptions will there be from the new tariffs?\nThey will apply to all countries except Canada and Mexico, which will be exempt while discussions over the North America Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) take place. There are provisions within the documents for other countries to get exemptions. \"We are going to be very fair, we're going to be very flexible,\" Mr Trump said earlier on Thursday. He also praised his country's close relationship and trade surplus with Australia, saying \"we'll be doing something with them\". The president linked defence spending to trade, and said the US \"subsidised many countries\" in the military. He said there would be a reduction in tariffs for countries that \"treat us fairly\", but said \"many of the countries that treat us the worst on trade and on military are our allies\", singling out Germany for criticism in his earlier comments. Why is Mr Trump doing this?\nMr Trump says he aims to protect the American worker - and he promised in his campaign that he would rebuild the steel and aluminium industries. The two metals are \"the bedrock of our defence-industrial base\", the president said on Thursday. The industry has been \"ravaged\" by aggressive foreign trade practices that are \"an assault on our country\", the president said. He is also making a political decision, aiming to appeal to blue-collar voters in states such as Pennsylvania - voters who turned away from the Democrats to support Mr Trump in 2016. The president says the US's trade deficit is due to \"very stupid\" deals and policies. Shorter version: This is about jobs, not commodity production. There's a reason Trump brought steel workers up on the podium to thank him. But he's using a national security provision to justify the move. End of Twitter post by @awzurcher What are possible repercussions?\nMr Trump's announcement last week about his plan to impose the hefty tariffs sparked alarm and upset markets at home and abroad. Major trading partners have threatened retaliation and the plans are opposed by many in his own party. Mr Trump has said that the US would \"win big\" in a trade war. Other countries are likely to take the US to court, arguing that the decision violates World Trade Organization moves. The White House says that the national security rationale for the move is \"unassailable\" and national security considerations are allowed under WTO rules. The director of UK Steel said the tariffs would have a profound and detrimental impact on the UK steel sector. \"Imposing such measures on US allies in the name of national security is difficult to comprehend,\" Gareth Stace added. What happens now?\nAnalysis by Natalie Sherman, BBC News business reporter, New York President Trump made clear on Wednesday he will consider exemptions to the tariffs. The move invites lobbying from other countries and could quiet critics who say his actions will lead to a trade war. Will Mr Trump's approach, which the White House has described as \"flexible\", mean this proves to be another announcement stronger on rhetoric than substance? We don't know yet. The White House has said exemptions will be granted to nations that offer other ways to resolve his concerns about national and economic security. The strategy has raised objections from at least one Republican. But should countries want to talk, that provides Mr Trump the opportunity to revisit a host of issues near and dear to his heart, including a wall along the Mexican border, barriers to US goods in countries like Germany and South Korea - even US contributions to security organisations like Nato. Mr Trump, who casts himself as the ultimate negotiator, is opening the door to more of the deal-making he appears to relish. ",

        "content": "Restaurant chains Wagamama and TGI Fridays have each been fined an undisclosed amount for failing to pay staff the National Minimum Wage. They were among 43 employers in the hospitality sector on the government's latest list of firms breaking the law. Wagamama has repaid an average of \u00a350 to 2,630 employees. TGI Friday's had to repay \u00a325 each to 2,300 staff. Wagamama blamed \"an inadvertent misunderstanding\" of the rules on staff uniforms for the blunder. A Wagamama spokesperson said the company had asked front-of-house staff to wear black jeans or a black skirt with their Wagamama-branded top. This was considered as asking them to buy a form of uniform, \"and so we should have paid them for it,\" the spokesperson said. \"We have gladly made payments to current and previous employees who missed out dating back from 2016 to 2013. We have also updated our uniform policy and we now pay a uniform supplement to cover the black jeans. \"Our people are the heart and soul of Wagamama and we take great pride in supporting and helping them to build their careers with us.\" A TGI Fridays spokesperson said the firm had reimbursed team members for a shoe allowance. The spokesperson added: \"This is a historic payment which was paid last year, and we have since reimbursed team members for the purchase of their black uniform shoes.\" In total, 179 employers were fined \u00a31.3m by the government for underpaying their staff. And they were warned that minimum pay rates will increase again on 1 April. Just before Christmas, Wagamama had to apologise after a note was seen in one of its London restaurants, apparently banning staff from taking sick days. The hotel chain Marriott was also fined. It underpaid 279 of its staff over \u00a3250 each on average. The company apologised and said it was committed to paying the National Minimum Wage. \"When an error was identified by a routine HMRC audit in 2015, we cooperated fully with HMRC and promptly reimbursed all those affected,\" a spokesperson said. \"We apologise to all our associates impacted by this error, and have taken steps to ensure it cannot happen again.\" In its response to the Matthew Taylor Review of the gig economy, called Good Work, the government has already announced plans to give all workers the right to a payslip. It said that would make it easier for 300,000 workers to check that they were being paid the legal minimum. Later this month, the government will launch an awareness campaign for the new minimum wage rates. Employers can be fined up to twice the total wage shortfall, subject to a maximum of \u00a320,000 per worker. ",

        "content": "A row has broken out between relatives of the late Mexican artist Frida Kahlo and the corporation which claims it holds the rights to her image. It comes after the toy company Mattel launched a range of new Barbie dolls based on \"Inspiring Women\" - Kahlo among them. In a statement, the family insisted Mattel was not authorised to base a doll on Kahlo. But both the Frida Kahlo Corporation and Mattel have rejected the claims. The artist with the famous unibrow was famous for her self-portraits and became a feminist icon. Since she died in 1954, her image has generated an array of consumer products, from tequila to lip gloss. This is not the first time that the commercial activities of the Frida Kahlo Corporation are said to have angered some of Kahlo's descendants. \"Mrs Mara Romeo, great-niece of Frida Kahlo, is the sole owner of the rights of the image of the illustrious Mexican painter Frida Kahlo,\" the family said in a statement. Mrs Romeo told AFP news agency that the problem was not confined to image rights. \"I would have liked the doll to have traits more like Frida's, not this doll with light-coloured eyes,\" she said. But Mattel said the company had the correct permission to produce the likeness. \"Mattel has worked in close partnership with the Frida Kahlo Corporation, the owner of all rights related to the name and identity of Frida Kahlo, on the creation of this doll,\" a spokesperson said. \"In addition to the Frida Kahlo Corporation being an important part of the doll development process, we have their permission and a legally binding agreement to make a doll in the likeness of the great Frida Kahlo.\" Mattel also provided a statement from the Frida Kahlo Corporation in which it said it derived its rights to reproduce Kahlo's image from Kahlo's niece, Isolda Pinedo Kahlo.

        "content": "As Dutch company Pal-V unveils its latest flying car gyrocopter at the Geneva motor show, we ask if the dream of flying cars for all could ever become a reality. \"007 was here\" says the graffiti emblazoned on the wall of Pal-V's stand at the Geneva motor show. Beneath it sits a creation James Bond would certainly be proud of. The Dutch company has just launched its first flying car on to the market. It's a compact three-wheeler, which it says can offer sporty performance on the road then take to the air using a set of extendable rotors. So is this a sign that air travel is about to get a whole lot more accessible, or will devices like this never be more than playthings for the rich? The car is called the Liberty. In flying terms, it is what's known as an auto-gyro, or gyrocopter. In other words, it has helicopter-like blades that rotate freely in order to generate lift, while power is provided by two 100 horsepower engines, via a separate propeller at the back. James Bond, aka 007, flew something similar in the film You Only Live Twice - a nippy runaround called Little Nellie - and the company is clearly quite happy with the comparison. But the Liberty is bigger, more luxurious, and it can also be used on the road, which means it is no ordinary autogyro. It can use one of its two engines to drive at up to 99mph (160km/h) on the ground, enabling the pilot to drive straight from the runway to his or her destination. The secret to doing this effectively, the company says, is technology that allows the car to tilt into corners and remain stable, despite its three-wheel design. It is this practicality that Pal-V thinks will be Liberty's main selling point. \"It's the frustration of general aviation,\" says chief executive Robert Dingemanse \"With a small plane or a helicopter you take off from a place you don't want to leave from, and end up in a place you don't really want to be. \"But if you drive, you can start at your garage door, then go straight to the place you want to be - and that's what we offer - 3D mobility.\" But a gyrocopter design has its drawbacks, argues Prof Harry Hoster, head of Lancaster University's Energy Research Centre. \"Gyrocopters can land in a very small area, unlike normal helicopters,\" he says, \"but they still need a bit of forward momentum before they can take off, so they wouldn't be able to use helicopter pads on the top of buildings, for example. \"And you would have issues in densely populated areas,\" he adds, \"because the rotors would need a large radius of free space.\" Noise would also be an issue in urban areas, Prof Hoster believes. Pal-V isn't the only company trying to make a commercial success out of a flying car. Others have taken a different approach, opting for fixed or folding wing designs. US-based Terrafugia, for example, which was recently bought by Volvo's Chinese owner Geely, has developed a flying car whose hinged wings fold up neatly after flight. Chris Jaran, Terrafugia's chief executive, tells the BBC: \"You can fit it in your garage, you can drive it to any airport, you can unfold the wings, fly it to another airport, fold it up and drive to your destination.\" The petrol-powered vehicle, which can travel at 70mph [113km/h] on the road and 100mph in the air, meets \"all of the regulations for airplanes and cars in the United States\", says Mr Jaran. Co-founders Anna and Carl Dietrich hope their craft will bring the vision of personal aviation for the masses a little closer. But at around $280,000 (\u00a3202,000) that's hardly a mass-market price. And the need to drive to an airport to fly the thing is another major drawback - one the company acknowledges. So it is working on a new version, the TF-X, featuring propellers that can tilt upwards for vertical lift-off, then tilt downwards for forward propulsion. Then there's Slovak firm AeroMobil - it has developed a car with wings that swing back tidily behind the cockpit after flight. It uses electric power on the road and a gasoline engine in the air. Yours for a mere $1.2m (\u00a3860,000). Nick Wirth, technical director at Wirth Research, a specialist racing car and drone designer, thinks that regulation is the flying car's biggest obstacle, not technology. \"Regulations covering airworthiness have been developed over 100 years, so it takes years of work to get something cleared for use by pilots. Crashing in an aircraft is usually a lot more serious than crashing in a car,\" he says. \"It's a huge difference owning and operating a car to owning and operating an aircraft.\" Current regulatory regimes around the world require flying car owners to have a pilot's licence, another potential barrier to mass adoption. More Technology of Business\n\"The problem is that you end up with a product that needs so much engineering and regulation around it you end up with something that's incredibly expensive,\" says Mr Wirth. \"Is there a market for this? There might be, but it's going to be tiny.\" And Bill Read, deputy editor of Aerospace, the Royal Aeronautical Society's magazine, says: \"If you have lots of them you'll have the equivalent of aerial traffic jams, so you'd have to have air corridors, specific heights they must fly at, and other rules for flying over cities. \"I think autonomous sky taxis stand more of a chance of achieving regulatory approval than flying cars.\" Mr Dingemanse says the Pal-V Liberty has been designed from the ground up to comply with aviation and road safety regulations. But like its potential rivals, it doesn't come cheap. An initial limited edition model will cost \u20ac500,000 (\u00a3450,000) - while the standard version will still set you back \u20ac300,000 (\u00a3270,000). The company hopes to sell about 1,000 aircraft a year. But so far, it hasn't sold any to spies. ",

        "content": "Complaints that MPs bullied, harassed and intimidated House of Commons staff have been uncovered in an investigation by BBC Two's Newsnight. The programme spoke to dozens of female workers who described aggressive and threatening behaviour. Among those accused of bullying was Speaker John Bercow, whose private secretary left her job in 2011. He rejects the allegation that he behaved in such a manner, \"either eight years ago, or at any other time\". \"Any suggestion to the contrary is simply untrue,\" a spokesman said. Newsnight has been investigating claims of bullying and harassment by MPs of members of the House of Commons Service - a group commonly known in Westminster as \"clerks\". One of the stories that emerged was that of Kate Emms - who worked as a private secretary to Mr Bercow, starting in mid-2010. Colleagues who spoke to Newsnight claimed that Mr Bercow, who is also the Conservative MP for Buckingham, had shouted at her and undermined her in front of other staff. This left her unable to continue working in what was a key Commons post, they said. She was signed off sick in early 2011 and then returned to a new post elsewhere in Parliament. Commons authorities were told that she had been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Two other MPs named in the investigation were Labour's Paul Farrelly and Conservative Mark Pritchard. Witnesses told Newsnight that Mr Farrelly's continued criticism over several years of Emily Commander, a clerk on two committees that the MP sat on, made her job impossible. One witness recalled his behaviour on a science committee trip to Italy in 2004, saying: \"He was a complete and utter bully. \"He wound her up like a screw and reduced her to tears. The more he upset her, the more he enjoyed it, the more he kept turning the screw. He was very aggressive. It felt like no one had the ability or authority to intervene. Everybody knew it was wrong.\" The two crossed paths again when Mr Farrelly was on the culture, media and sport committee in 2010. Documents obtained by Newsnight show she complained then of a campaign of continual belittling and undermining and that she told her bosses that she had \"repeated nightmares about going on Committee visits with Mr Farrelly and being criticised by him for having neglected tiny details\". Mr Farrelly has denied any bullying. He told Newsnight: \"In 2012 allegations were made about me having bullied a clerk to the committee during the compilation of the phone-hacking report. These allegations were investigated and not upheld.\" \"Despite this, I apologised if I had inadvertently upset the clerk who had suffered stress. The policy under which they were investigated was considered to be so unfair to those complained about that it was immediately withdrawn and replaced by another policy.\" Newsnight also spoke to several clerks about Mr Pritchard, MP for the Wrekin, who say he was notorious for shouting at and berating clerks. One witness told how he \"exploded\" at a female staff member ahead of a trip to California because he was unhappy with the choice of hotel he had been booked into. He then angrily swore at the same woman on the trip itself. Mr Pritchard said: \"I understand, over the past several years the House authorities have addressed numerous complaints about MPs, but they have also informed me they have no record of any complaints against me, and if they had, I would have been notified. Other women working in the House told Newsnight they had been pushed against walls, forcibly kissed, groped and slapped by MPs. They said that complaints had not been taken seriously, and that they fear that when complaints are made it is the clerks who are made to move jobs while the MPs are left in place. Since 2014, when the current HR processes were introduced, no complaints raised by staff members have been escalated to formal channels, such as mediation. The House of Commons said in a statement: \"The House of Commons takes pride in being a responsible and supportive employer, and does not tolerate bullying or harassment of any kind.\" \"In 2014 the House of Commons introduced the revised Respect policy which is specifically designed to combat bullying and harassment of House employees by MPs or their staff. In addition, we have implemented a range of measures to complement the respect policy, including training for managers on how to address reports of bullying or harassment and a team of trained bullying and harassment contacts for staff to approach should they have concerns.\" A longer version of this story is available here.

        "content": "The arduous task of building Stonehenge may have been part of a ceremonial celebration, claim historians. The circle in Wiltshire was built 2,500 years ago using bluestones from South Wales - a decision which has long baffled experts. Susan Greaney, from English Heritage, said they now believed that Neolithic people did not want to make \"things as easy and quick as possible\". Building the monument was as important as \"its final intended use,\" she added. Experts have tried to discover why the people who built Stonehenge chose to use some stones from the Preseli Hills, around 250km away. The stones were probably transported via water networks and hauled over land, using a huge amount of labour over the long and difficult journey. Experts now believe the construction of the monument was just as important to Neolithic people as worshipping in it. \"In contemporary Western culture, we are always striving to make things as easy and quick as possible, but we believe that for the builders of Stonehenge this may not have been the case,\" said Ms Greaney. English Heritage also thinks people may have gone on a kind of celebration pilgrimage to help construct the monument. The new theory follows the discovery of a feasting site at nearby Durrington Walls settlement, which attracted people from all over the country to help build Stonehenge. Historians think holding ceremonial feasts close to the Stonehenge site to celebrate the build \"was potentially a powerful tool in demonstrating the strength of the community to outsiders\". English Heritage believe this theory is backed up by a photograph taken during a stone-pulling ceremony on the island of Nias, Indonesia, in 1915. It shows people in ceremonial dress \"revelling in the seemingly arduous task of moving enormous monoliths by hand, taking part in feasts and associated dances\". Ms Greaney added: \"As soon as you abandon modern preconceptions which assume Neolithic people would have sought the most efficient way of building Stonehenge, questions like why the bluestones were brought from so far away - the Preseli Hills of South Wales - don't seem quite so perplexing.\" In order to test the celebration theory, English Heritage will begin moving a replica stone on Friday using teams of volunteers in an \"experiential archaeology\" project. In a statement it said the aim was to see how Neolithic people may have cooperated to build the monument and suggests \"visitors abandon 21st-century thinking to understand how the monument was built\". Stonehenge\nThe first monument at Stonehenge was a circular earthwork enclosure with a ring of 56 timber or stone posts, built in about 3000 BC. This was replaced around 2500 BC with sarsen stones and smaller bluestones. Most archaeologists believe the sarsen stones were brought from the Marlborough Downs, 20 miles (32km) away. The sarsens weigh on average 25 tonnes, with the largest stone, the Heel Stone, weighing about 30 tonnes. The smaller bluestone came from the Preseli Hills, 250 kms away in south-west Wales. The stones, which weigh between two and five tonnes each, were probably carried via water networks and hauled over land. Source: English Heritage ",

The 400ft-deep, three-mile long ravine - England's largest- need to be cleared of loose rocks and other hazards. A team of 15 \"rope access technicians\", suspended up to 121m off the ground, will spend six weeks ridding the Somerset landmark of unwanted detritus. The Longleat Estate, which manages the gorge, said about 37,500 sq m of rock face would be cleared. Members of the team will also work above the B3135, which runs through the chasm, to stabilise the rock face with mesh and wire. They will also be inserting monitoring studs into parts of the rock to try and track any rock movement. Leon Troake, Cheddar Gorge's operations manager, said the rock can now be maintained and managed \"in situ\" rather than \"having to prise large chunks off. \"In the past we would have had to close the entire gorge in order for the work to be undertaken,\" he said. \"This remedial work means we can also begin to remove invasive species including ivy, red valerian and ash trees which will provide more growing space for endemic species like the Cheddar pink which is only found here.\" The work is due to be complete by Easter.

        "content": "As Dutch company Pal-V unveils its latest flying car gyrocopter at the Geneva motor show, we ask if the dream of flying cars for all could ever become a reality. \"007 was here\" says the graffiti emblazoned on the wall of Pal-V's stand at the Geneva motor show. Beneath it sits a creation James Bond would certainly be proud of. The Dutch company has just launched its first flying car on to the market. It's a compact three-wheeler, which it says can offer sporty performance on the road then take to the air using a set of extendable rotors. So is this a sign that air travel is about to get a whole lot more accessible, or will devices like this never be more than playthings for the rich? The car is called the Liberty. In flying terms, it is what's known as an auto-gyro, or gyrocopter. In other words, it has helicopter-like blades that rotate freely in order to generate lift, while power is provided by two 100 horsepower engines, via a separate propeller at the back. James Bond, aka 007, flew something similar in the film You Only Live Twice - a nippy runaround called Little Nellie - and the company is clearly quite happy with the comparison. But the Liberty is bigger, more luxurious, and it can also be used on the road, which means it is no ordinary autogyro. It can use one of its two engines to drive at up to 99mph (160km/h) on the ground, enabling the pilot to drive straight from the runway to his or her destination. The secret to doing this effectively, the company says, is technology that allows the car to tilt into corners and remain stable, despite its three-wheel design. It is this practicality that Pal-V thinks will be Liberty's main selling point. \"It's the frustration of general aviation,\" says chief executive Robert Dingemanse \"With a small plane or a helicopter you take off from a place you don't want to leave from, and end up in a place you don't really want to be. \"But if you drive, you can start at your garage door, then go straight to the place you want to be - and that's what we offer - 3D mobility.\" But a gyrocopter design has its drawbacks, argues Prof Harry Hoster, head of Lancaster University's Energy Research Centre. \"Gyrocopters can land in a very small area, unlike normal helicopters,\" he says, \"but they still need a bit of forward momentum before they can take off, so they wouldn't be able to use helicopter pads on the top of buildings, for example. \"And you would have issues in densely populated areas,\" he adds, \"because the rotors would need a large radius of free space.\" Noise would also be an issue in urban areas, Prof Hoster believes. Pal-V isn't the only company trying to make a commercial success out of a flying car. Others have taken a different approach, opting for fixed or folding wing designs. US-based Terrafugia, for example, which was recently bought by Volvo's Chinese owner Geely, has developed a flying car whose hinged wings fold up neatly after flight. Chris Jaran, Terrafugia's chief executive, tells the BBC: \"You can fit it in your garage, you can drive it to any airport, you can unfold the wings, fly it to another airport, fold it up and drive to your destination.\" The petrol-powered vehicle, which can travel at 70mph [113km/h] on the road and 100mph in the air, meets \"all of the regulations for airplanes and cars in the United States\", says Mr Jaran. Co-founders Anna and Carl Dietrich hope their craft will bring the vision of personal aviation for the masses a little closer. But at around $280,000 (\u00a3202,000) that's hardly a mass-market price. And the need to drive to an airport to fly the thing is another major drawback - one the company acknowledges. So it is working on a new version, the TF-X, featuring propellers that can tilt upwards for vertical lift-off, then tilt downwards for forward propulsion. Then there's Slovak firm AeroMobil - it has developed a car with wings that swing back tidily behind the cockpit after flight. It uses electric power on the road and a gasoline engine in the air. Yours for a mere $1.2m (\u00a3860,000). Nick Wirth, technical director at Wirth Research, a specialist racing car and drone designer, thinks that regulation is the flying car's biggest obstacle, not technology. \"Regulations covering airworthiness have been developed over 100 years, so it takes years of work to get something cleared for use by pilots. Crashing in an aircraft is usually a lot more serious than crashing in a car,\" he says. \"It's a huge difference owning and operating a car to owning and operating an aircraft.\" Current regulatory regimes around the world require flying car owners to have a pilot's licence, another potential barrier to mass adoption. More Technology of Business\n\"The problem is that you end up with a product that needs so much engineering and regulation around it you end up with something that's incredibly expensive,\" says Mr Wirth. \"Is there a market for this? There might be, but it's going to be tiny.\" And Bill Read, deputy editor of Aerospace, the Royal Aeronautical Society's magazine, says: \"If you have lots of them you'll have the equivalent of aerial traffic jams, so you'd have to have air corridors, specific heights they must fly at, and other rules for flying over cities. \"I think autonomous sky taxis stand more of a chance of achieving regulatory approval than flying cars.\" Mr Dingemanse says the Pal-V Liberty has been designed from the ground up to comply with aviation and road safety regulations. But like its potential rivals, it doesn't come cheap. An initial limited edition model will cost \u20ac500,000 (\u00a3450,000) - while the standard version will still set you back \u20ac300,000 (\u00a3270,000). The company hopes to sell about 1,000 aircraft a year. But so far, it hasn't sold any to spies. ",

        "content": "Flying over Nezahualc\u00f3yotl in a police helicopter gives a sense of the challenges its residents face. Originally built on the drained bed of Lake Texcoco, the suburb stretches out below in a patchwork of low-income housing with more than a million people crammed inside. Ciudad Neza, as it is commonly known, is now the most densely populated place in Mexico, part of the vast urban sprawl outside Mexico City. Over the years. criminal networks have taken hold, often with the complicity of local police. Municipal officers insist they have changed, saying that their force has been purged, that corruption is being weeded out and replaced with a sense of civic duty. The man they credit for the turnaround is Jorge Amador, a former sociology professor turned police chief. \"I think we've broken with the traditional way of thinking on local policing here,\" he says, in a rare show of pride. \"Unfortunately all too often in our country police chiefs and politicians have seen security not as a public service but as a business, as a way to make money.\" Purge\nWhen he was first appointed to oversee security in Neza a decade ago, Jorge Amador began by removing more than 100 corrupt or unfit officers. He also improved wages and conditions for those who stayed. Some of his ideas were considered unorthodox, such as promoting literature and chess among his officers. But the intention, he says, was to combat \"inertia\", a term he uses often. \"We had to tackle that inertia, and dignify the role of a police officer once again.\" Chess competitions and poetry readings among police officers is all well and good, but as many analysts point out, Mexico's problems run deep. Last year was the most violent year in the country's drug war with more than 23,000 people killed. With their key leaders either dead or arrested, several drug cartels splintered and battled each other for control. Boots on the ground\nFor two consecutive administrations, the Mexican army has been deployed to try to bring peace to the streets, often playing the role of the police in many communities. Now the Mexican government wants to make that role permanent by law. The \"Interior Security Law\" is deeply controversial given the army's poor human rights record and prominent activists such as Jos\u00e9 Antonio Guevara have grave reservations. \"In carrying out these police duties over the past 12 years, the army has tortured thousands of people and has disappeared and summarily executed many thousands more,\" he argues. Specifically he referred to notorious incidents like the disappearance and subsequent murder of 43 student teachers in Ayotzinapa in 2014. The BBC requested an interview with the Mexican military and the ministry of interior but none was granted. At the local level, Mr Amador also does not think that the answer lies with the army. \"For us, security comes from bringing society closer together, from a closer relationship between the people and their institutions.\" Different approach\nSo he tried two other approaches in Neza instead. The first was to introduce new technology. In a nerve centre at police headquarters, the officers can see every corner of Neza via a sophisticated system of CCTV cameras. A network of neighbourhood watch groups was also set up, which is directly in touch with the patrols via WhatsApp. There was also a return to some very basic community policing. For example, the municipality was divided up into smaller units comprised of just three or four blocks. The local officers now hold regular neighbourhood meetings in the evenings so people can air their grievances in the open. At one such meeting, it was clear that although car theft and violent crime are well below the national average, no-one was under the impression that Neza was now crime-free. Residents did say that had noticed some improvements though. \"It's not perfect but we've started to work together at last,\" Sandra said. \"At least when we ask the officers for help, they come out much quicker than before.\" Her neighbour, Gerardo, pointed to a street alarm installed by the police. \"We report anything strange or suspicious that we see. And when that alarm goes off, I've seen neighbours come out half dressed and with a spade in their hands to defend our street from criminals!\" It is an election year in Mexico and security remains a key campaign issue. Many Mexicans believe their local police cannot be trusted. While in much of the country that may be true, Neza's unconventional police chief claims he has proven officers are not all bad apples, rotten to the core. \"We have to challenge this idea that police in Mexico are corrupt, inefficient, criminal, abusive. That this is how they are and how they'll always be.\" ",

        "content": "Poor, rural societies which ate high-quality foods bought locally had the best diet and health in mid-Victorian Britain, a new report has revealed. The healthiest regions, measured by low mortality rates, were often the most isolated. In those areas, people would have consumed plenty of locally-produced potatoes, whole grains, vegetables, fish and milk. There were also fewer deaths there from pulmonary tuberculosis. This suggests people had better diets, the researchers writing in JRSM Open suggest. They found the most nutritious diets were enjoyed in isolated, rural areas of England, the mainland and islands of Scotland and the west of Ireland - which was at that time part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Dr Peter Greaves, study author from the Leicester Cancer Research Centre, said: \"The fact that these better-fed regions of Britain also showed lower mortality rates is entirely consistent with recent studies that have shown a decreased risk of death, following improvement towards a higher Mediterranean dietary standard. \"The rural diet was often better for the poor in more isolated areas because of payment in kind, notably in grain, potatoes, meat, milk or small patches of land to grow vegetables or to keep animals. \"Unfortunately, these societies were in the process of disappearing under the pressure of urbanisation, commercial farming and migration.\" Dr Greaves said these changes in Victorian society led to worse diets among poor, rural populations and resulted in locally-produced food becoming less diverse - something that has since occurred across the world. You may also like:\nIn the middle of the 19th Century, fewer than half of the near 19 million people in England and Wales were living in large urban centres. Among the three million population of Scotland, only one million lived in town districts, while fewer than 30% of the 5.5 million population of Ireland was urban. For many poor people across Britain, white bread made from bolted wheat flour was the staple component of the diet. When they could afford it, people would supplement this with vegetables, fruit and animal-derived foods such as meat, fish, milk, cheese and eggs - a Mediterranean-style diet. Poor people living in wealthier farming districts who were usually paid in cash often had great difficulty getting these foods on a regular basis, but in more isolated areas of Britain milk and fish were more accessible. A good number of country dwellers lived to ripe old ages, the researchers said. In the poor rural districts of Connaught in the west of Ireland, for example, nearly 20% of people reached the age of 65 or more and some reached the age of 95 or even 100. ",

        "content": "Asian markets moved higher on Friday, on hopes that North Korean nuclear tensions might be easing. Investors responded to US President Donald Trump accepting an invitation for face-to-face talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 2% while South Korea's Kospi edged up by 1.7%. There was already some optimism on the markets after Mr Trump earlier left the door open for possible exemptions to US tariffs on steel and aluminium. A sigh of relief is no surprise - Analysis by Karishma Vaswani, Asia Business Correspondent\nInvestors in the region have been watching the potential conflict between the US and North Korea for months now. And news that the two could meet by May of this year is being greeted with a sigh of relief by many. And that shouldn't come as a surprise. Nobody wants a conflict on the Korean peninsula to break out, especially between arguably two of the world's most volatile leaders. East Asian economies would be almost certainly be hit, because of integrated supply chains in the region. It's a region central to global shipping and manufacturing, so any escalation of the current tensions could disrupt trade and economic activity, But perhaps what's more interesting, is what a potential meeting between \"Rocket Man\" and the \"Dotard\" says about just how badly the North Korean economy may be doing as sanctions bite. On other markets Hong Kong's Hang Seng edged 0.7% higher, while China's mainland indexes also made small gains. Australia's All Ordinaries rose 0.6%. The South Korean won climbed slightly, while the Japanese yen slipped against the US dollar. That is not unexpected given the yen is a safe haven currency, with investors tending to seek out riskier assets with better returns when things appear more stable. ",

        "content": "Parents in the UK are much less likely to spend more than an hour per day helping with their children's homework compared with parents in other countries, a survey suggests. A survey of 27,830 parents in 29 countries found only 11% of UK parents spent an hour per day helping their children, far behind 62% in India. But 87% of UK parents valued the quality of their children's teachers. This was among the highest levels of any of the surveyed countries. Kenyan parents had the most positive view of their teachers, with 92% rating them as good. Valuing 'happiness'\nThe survey, commissioned by the Varkey Foundation, which organises the annual Global Teacher Prize, has compared the attitudes and priorities of parents in a range of different countries. There were many common attitudes - with parents concerned about whether their children would get good jobs and careers. But in terms of worries about their children's future, parents in the UK were well above average in being concerned about terrorism and conflict, a pattern also seen in France and Germany. When deciding on the type of school they wanted for their children, UK parents prioritised a sense of \"ethos\" and high academic results. But compared with other countries, parents in the UK were also likely to put a high emphasis on \"happiness\" for children in school. Parents in countries such as China and Vietnam were much less likely to make happiness a priority, with greater concern for the quality of teaching. In terms of funding, parents in the UK said they would put any extra education budget into hiring and paying teachers, rather than technology or facilities. Better or worse?\nIn terms of optimism over whether schools are better than a decade ago, countries such as China, India, South Korea and Vietnam were much more likely to think schools had improved. But parents in France, Germany, Italy and the UK were more likely to be pessimistic and see schools as slipping backwards. Vikas Pota, chief executive of the Varkey Foundation, said that despite pressure on school budgets it is \"heartening to see that parents are among the most confident in the world about the quality of teaching in their child's school\". But he said it was \"sobering\" that parents in the UK are \"spending so little time helping their child with their education - lagging behind almost every other country we surveyed\". ",

        "content": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has invited Donald Trump to meet him, an unprecedented overture which the US leader has said he will accept. The shock announcement was made by senior South Korean officials in Washington, who passed on a letter from the North Korean leader. They said Mr Kim had also agreed to halt nuclear and missile tests and was \"committed to denuclearisation\". It appears to be a major breakthrough after months of threats and violence. However analysts warn that such summits are usually the result of years of careful diplomacy so remain sceptical about what these rapidly arranged talks can achieve. Mr Trump said the development was \"great progress\" but that sanctions will remain in place until a firm agreement is reached. North Korea has not yet issued any official comment on the week's developments. South Korean National security adviser Chung Eui-yong, speaking outside the White House after the meeting, said: \"I told President Trump that at our meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said he's committed to denuclearisation.\" He added: \"President Trump appreciated the briefing, and said he would meet Kim Jong-un by May to achieve permanent denuclearisation.\" How did we reach this point?\nNorth Korea has been isolated on the international stage for decades because of its well-documented human rights abuses and its pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws. It says it needs nuclear weapons and missiles because its survival is under threat. It has carried out six nuclear tests, though it's still unclear whether it could carry out a long-distance nuclear attack. But South Korea's hosting of the Winter Olympics gave an unexpected window for diplomacy, as rare inter-Korean talks were held to facilitate the North's carefully choreographed attendance. The South Korean delegation then held landmark talks with Mr Kim in Pyongyang earlier this week. They returned with a statement saying the North was willing to denuclearise if it felt \"it has no reason to retain nukes\". What has North Korea actually pledged?\nThere are four main things: The BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says it is important to note that North Korea has not yet promised to abandon its nuclear weapons completely. It also remains unclear exactly what it is asking for in return. The North has halted missile and nuclear tests during previous talks before, only to resume when it lost patience or felt it was not getting what it demanded. The last point is also significant. The US has had tens of thousands of military personnel in South Korea since the end of the Korea War. The massive annual joint war games infuriate the North, because it believes they are preparation for invasion. They were due to take place during the Olympics but have been suspended for now. Is this a victory for Trump?\nMr Trump has repeatedly belittled Kim Jong-un, and last year threatened him with \"fire and fury the likes of which the world has never seen before\" if he continued to threaten the US. He has at times said there is no point in talking to North Korea. But Mr Chung made a point of saying it was Mr Trump's \"maximum pressure policy\" which had brought the parties to this point. Christopher Hill, formerly the US negotiator with North Korea, told the BBC Mr Trump may have frightened Pyongyang by \"looking at options that many American presidents would not have gone for\". But he has also shown flexibility to meet people other presidents might have dismissed, he says. Our correspondent says Kim Jong-un has also scored a propaganda win, first with the Olympics and now by being seen to reach out to the US. What about the other major players?\nThe South's statement also credited \"international solidarity\" for reaching this point. That is likely in part a reference to international sanctions, which have increased with each North Korean show of force. China, North Korea's main economic supporter, has in recent months toughened up its dealings with the North, including on key areas like petroleum and oil, which is thought to be putting a major strain on the North. Japan, which saw North Korean missiles fly over its territory twice last year, is routinely distrustful of Pyongyang's motives, saying it must commit to giving up its weapons before any talks can take place. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe welcomed news of a Trump-Kim meeting, but said: \"We will keep putting maximum pressure until North Korea takes concrete actions toward denuclearisation.\" Have talks like this happened in the past?\nNo sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader, but there have been repeated attempts to get North Korea to denuclearise. The last major effort - the Six Party talks - collapsed in 2008, largely because North Korea refused to allow inspectors to verify that it had shut down its nuclear programme. A number of bids to restart the talks also collapsed, including in 2012 when North Korea launched another rocket, two weeks after announcing a \"leap day\" agreement with the US. Where might these talks happen?\nKim Jong-un is under a range of travel sanctions, so his options are limited. It is thought to be unlikely that Mr Trump would go to North Korea. They could meet in the demilitarized zone - the border between the North and South - or more likely, China will host them. ",

        "content": "Researchers are using powerful X-rays to look inside cannonballs found on the famous Tudor ship, the Mary Rose. They are trying to find a way of preserving the shot, which will corrode if it is put on display. There are 1,2000 of the cannonballs, found on Henry VIII's flagship, currently stored in low humidity containers away from public gaze. The aim, according to Dr Eleanor Schofield, is to preserve them for generations to come. \"We have a lot of cannonballs in storage. If we could understand the process better we could develop new treatments and they could potentially have a longer life.\" The Mary Rose sank in 1545 and was raised from the sea in 1982. The cannonballs on board are difficult to conserve because chlorine has got into them from being in the sea. The chemical has got in all the way to its core. This means that they start to corrode if they are exposed to the air. Dr Schofield's team has tried to remove the chlorine by soaking some cannonballs in solution. But the researchers found that although they had extracted some they hadn't removed it all. They discovered this when the cannonballs began to disintegrate when they were put on display. It was at this point that Dr Schofield set up a research project to understand what was going on inside the cannonballs. She examined them using a powerful X-ray facility, called the Diamond Light Source in Didcot in Oxfordshire. Dr Schofield is using it to see how much iron is still left inside the cannonballs, how much chlorine is in them and where they have begun to corrode. But in order to examine them, these precious objects had to be cut into small pieces. After consulting with Mary Rose curators, the decision was made in 2016 to cut segments from six of the cannonballs, some of which were showing signs of damage, in order to save the rest. In a newly-published paper, the results of the bright X-rays have revealed detailed maps of the elements involved in the corrosive process. This allows an unprecedented insight into conservation on a molecular scale. Hayley Simon from University College and Diamond Light Source said that the results are a first step towards the development of new protective techniques. \"We are launching next a long duration experiment, which will observe changes in the corrosion product during long-term immersion in various conservation treatments to monitor their effects.\" Follow Pallab on Twitter ",

        "content": "A proposal to impose a so-called latte levy on throwaway coffee cups has been rejected by the government. MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee had suggested a charge of 25p for disposable coffee cups to reduce their use. But ministers say it is better for shops to offer voluntary discounts to customers bringing their own cups. MPs says the government's response suggests it is not serious about its promise to tackle plastic litter. Committee chairwoman Mary Creagh said: \"The UK's throwaway culture is having a devastating impact on our streets, beaches and seas. Our report recommended practical solutions to the disposable packaging crisis. The government's response shows that despite warm words they plan no real action.\" She said evidence to the committee showed charges work better than discounts for reducing the use of non-recyclable materials - as was the case with the plastic bag charge. \"By choosing to favour voluntary discounts, the government is ignoring the evidence about what works,\" she said. The government said it was serious about the issue - but did not want to jump to hasty conclusions. Its response to the committee, it said: \"Coffee cups make up 0.7% of total paper packaging waste in the UK. We believe it is important to look at the packaging and waste management system as a whole.\" It said ministers had heard little evidence that recyclable cups would meet industry standards prohibiting coffee-covered containers from contaminating the recycling stream. More research is needed, ministers said. But the government did signal an intent to reform what's known as the \"producer responsibility\" system in which packaging firms chip in towards the cost of recycling technology. A report this week from the waste consultancy Eunomia said the industry was exaggerating the waste it recycles and paying far too little towards the \u00a32.8bn cost to households of collecting and dealing with waste. The National Audit Office is launching a review of the government's oversight of the system, following a request from the Environmental Audit Committee, which has concerns that it is opaque, and could be subject to fraud and non-compliance.

        "content": "South Korean leader Moon Jae-in is either a diplomatic genius or a communist set on destroying his country and US President Donald Trump is either a master of brinkmanship or a pawn in a more devious game - depending on who you speak to. But it is the other actor in this saga, Kim Jong-un, the only one who has yet to make a direct statement, who may just be the most significant player in this most extraordinary of political gambles. From the moment he extended an apparent olive branch to the South in his new year message to the cordial delegations to Pyeongchang for the Winter Olympics, it became clear that Kim Jong-un had mastered the most sophisticated crafts of propaganda. Some will view his personal invitation to Mr Trump to hold talks with him - as well as the commitment to freeze further nuclear tests - as the real diplomatic masterstroke after a year that was unprecedented for the level of naked hostility the US and the North bared toward one another. But the risk here belongs to both Moon Jae-in and Donald Trump. In a situation where neither can claim sole mastery of the narrative, without a clear exit strategy, and when there are so many definitions for both success and failure, a lot is at stake. Whose charm offensive?\nMr Moon is viewed by his supporters as the negotiator-in-chief who has now skilfully managed to get Mr Kim to at least talk about getting rid of nuclear weapons. He is the one who spotted the opportunity during the North Korean leader's speech in January - which offered a glimmer of hope that the reclusive state was willing to engage with the South - and grabbed it with both hands. The dizzying level of diplomacy and a frenzy of visits between North and South has now delivered - it seems. \"People are calling this the North Korean charm offensive, I actually think this is a South Korean charm offensive. This is something President Moon Jae-in clearly wanted,\" John Delury from Yonsei University said to me even before the talks were announced. Mr Moon knew his envoys would have to extract the word \"denuclearisation\" from Mr Kim when they visited Pyongyang. He also knew having two of his top level government ministers looking cosy with the North Korean leader would not go down well in Washington or Tokyo. But it was worth the risk. The US would not have considered talking to the communist state without that meeting. His chosen delegates got what they needed. The South Korean leader is also attempting the role of honest broker, handling Mr Trump and Mr Kim at the same time. He is choosing his words carefully and keeping his cards close to his chest while flattering those who respond to the spotlight. In his New Year's address he said Mr Trump deserved \"huge credit\" for talks between the two Koreas, knowing it would please him. He is also using language that will reassure a concerned Republican administration. The language of the South Korean statement announcing the talks was also fulsome in its admiration for Trump's handling of the situation leading up to this moment. Sanctions will stay in place, Mr Moon had said earlier, and Mr Trump has now confirmed that. Manipulated by North Korea?\nBut everybody knows it wasn't always like that. Just six months ago Mr Trump was promising to rain down \"fire and fury like the world has never seen\" on North Korea if it dare threaten the US. Prof Haksoon Paik, lead researcher at the Sejong Institute, said that threat level felt \"totally unprecedented\". \"President Moon was very much concerned about nuclear threat of war. Kim Jong-un was in the same situation. We were hearing from the likes of the US Senator Lindsay Graham that lives will be lost over here. Donald Trump's unorthodox and unstable leadership had both Korean leaders worried about the potential of military options.\" The US has always maintained that the permanent denuclearisation of North Korea is the endgame. Even with all the surprises up to this point, few believe Mr Kim would agree to that so if they don't achieve that what options does Trump have? So is Moon Jae-in - and indeed Donald Trump - being manipulated by a North Korea which has fooled the world before? \"By dangling before the US once again 'denuclearization of the Korean peninsula' and 'moratorium on nuclear and missile tests', Kim seeks to weaken sanctions, pre-empt US military pre-emption, and condition the world into accepting North Korea as a legitimate nuclear state,\" says Prof Lee Sung-yoon from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University. For Mr Trump this could be about one of the boldest and most historic moves a US leader has made in foreign relations. If this gamble works out, Mr Trump could credit himself as the president who sorted out North Korea. His administration has had very few victories, despite promising his voters there would \"so much winning.\" He believes his \"maximum pressure\" strategy and his work to get China on side and help squeeze Pyongyang economically is working. Reporters say he casually mentioned in the White House briefing room that he hoped they would give him credit for Kim Jong-un's offer. His voters certainly will. But meeting Mr Kim risks treating the communist leader as an equal. It could be a PR disaster. The date set is also only a few months away - a short time frame to achieve diplomatic goals with a leader he mocked as \"little rocket man\" just a few months ago. Prof Robert E Kelly at Busan University in South Korea tweeted: \"Trump doesn't study or even read. He tends to fly wildly off script. And May means there's almost no time for all the staff prep necessary.\" Pyongyang has been playing this game for decades. Mr Trump is new to it. He may see a big win on the horizon, but his Art of the Deal book will not be the guide he needs to deal with Kim Jong-un. Politics is personal\nFor Mr Moon this is about history and it is also personal. He played a part in previous attempts to negotiate with North Korea as chief of staff to President Roh Moo-hyun when he met Mr Kim's father, Kim Jong-il, in 2007. That was the last time the leaders of the two Koreas held a summit. A satellite launch by Pyongyang ended the talks. By then around $4.5bn of aid had been sent North during the policy of engagement. Critics believe that money helped to accelerate the weapons programme. Having failed once before, Mr Moon is trying to complete the work he started, says Duyeon Kim, a senior fellow at the Korean Peninsula Forum. \"He's basically following the same playbook as his two liberal predecessors. It's exactly the kind of thing he would want to pick up and continue.\" As a son of refugees from the North, Mr Moon is also aware of the effects of conflict on the peninsula. His parents fled North Korea aboard a UN supply ship in 1950 at the start of the Korean War alongside thousands of other refugees. He told reporters during his election campaign: \"My father fled from the North, hating communism. I myself hate the communist North Korean system. That doesn't mean I should let the people in the North suffer under an oppressive regime.\" President Moon has acknowledged there are obstacles ahead. He is managing expectations and so much can go wrong. Duyeon Kim believes there is a high probability that at the end of this negotiating process, all parties will fail, and North Korea will decide it wants to keep its nuclear weapons. And yet... \"You just don't know. I don't think its ever a lost cause, in spite of all the doubts and scepticism all parties should go in with clear eyes, but negotiate hard.\" President Moon's approval ratings took a hit during the Winter Olympics after he integrated the women's hockey team with players from the North and met a general from Pyongyang who had been accused of masterminding deadly attacks on South Koreans, though they have since rebounded. He may suffer politically if this fails but maybe for him, this is not about scoring political points. This is what he told Time magazine last year when he was presidential candidate: \"My mother is the only one [of her family] who fled to the South. [She] is 90 years old. Her younger sister is still in the North alive. My mother's last wish is to see her again.\" These talks are a huge gamble with a communist state which is hard to read. But if, just if, he helps pull it off it may reduce the threat of nuclear war and he could win himself a Nobel peace prize. If all fails. it is back to brinkmanship. ",

        "content": "A stout figure, with a dense thatch of grey hair, stabs at the air with indignant fingers and raps out orders to an underling. Through the thick smoke in the room, it is almost possible to believe that the bogeyman of the Balkans has returned. Slobodan Milosevic is back - and this time he means business\u2026 show business. The Slobodan Show is a musical about the tumultuous times of the 1990s, with Yugoslavia's notorious former president as its central character. Seeing the Serbian ultra-nationalist revived on stage may come as something of a jolt to the audience. 'What marked our youth'\nEven the actor portraying Milosevic still seems rather dazed to find himself in the position of bringing back to life a man whom many people viewed as a monster. \"Director Nenad Todorovic first proposed this play about a year ago - and when he suggested it to me, at first I couldn't believe I'd be doing a show about Slobodan Milosevic,\" says Dejan Cicmilovic. \"I lived through my 20s in the 1990s, those were the best years of my youth. Back then I spent more time in street protests than at university. \"Our goal was to topple Milosevic: we were all fed up with war, bloodshed, inflation, lack of freedom and oppressive autocratic rule.\" It may have taken a period of adjustment but Cicmilovic is now fully committed to the role. He says this is a good moment to revisit the Milosevic era and all it represented. \"The mission of theatre is to subvert life. The cast and crew feel now is the time to talk about Milosevic and the 1990s - and I agree. \"I think enough time has gone by for us to be able to talk impartially about what happened and what marked the best years of our youth.\" At rehearsals in Belgrade, a group of young women practised energetic dance steps, while a small choir ran through some wordless vocalisations. It seems an unlikely accompaniment to the story of the 1990s, when Milosevic was the leading actor in a series of conflicts which caused the deaths of around 100,000 people. Countless more were driven from their homes; many have never returned. Who was Slobodan Milosevic?\nThe charges against Milosevic Springtime for Milosevic?\nReports suggest ethnic Albanians have avoided the show but playwright Jelena Bogavac is unapologetic about making a Milosevic musical. She reckons that if Mel Brooks can offer the world Springtime for Hitler, then there is no reason to feel any compunction about producing the Slobodan Show. \"I saw so many musicals about people who were main players in historical catastrophes - so why not Milosevic?\" she asks. \"Here in Serbian society there is a really big hole in trying to talk about the Milosevic phenomenon. Society never concluded whether he was guilty or not - shame for society and good for us if we can pose those questions.\" The very existence of the Slobodan Show represents a considerable irony. The 1990s was a decade of repression in Milosevic's rapidly diminishing Yugoslavia, where artistic expression could be dangerous. Filmmaker Goran Markovic was among the many creative people who went into exile so they could continue their work without interference from the regime. \"All the aspects of power - including the cultural world - were in the hands of the Milosevic spouses and their minions,\" he says. \"This was mostly concentrated around the national TV - a monstrous organisation used for calls to arms and propaganda. In terms of personal expression, if you wanted to do anything you wouldn't be able to unless it was in co-operation with national TV. That was something I couldn't and wouldn't do.\" But even though the Milosevic era damaged his own career, Goran welcomes the production of the Slobodan Show. \"It's important to reflect the times in relation to what's happening today. Young people today don't know about what happened in the Milosevic regime.\" Some of those young people are now working on the Slobodan Show. They may have little or no recollection of the Milosevic era - but they are keen to explore what happened in their infancy. \"We are a divided nation - 50% say we should go right and 50% say left,\" says choir director Dimitrije Dimitrijevic. \"Many people in Serbia are still loving the idea of Slobodan Milosevic. \"It's frightening that there are still extremists in Serbia - but I like to spread the truth and like to express my talent. I love the idea of this musical; Jelena is an amazing and talented woman - that's why we're doing it.\" Kosovo premiere\nThe show received its premiere in Gracanica, a majority ethnic Serb area of Kosovo. Jelena Bogavac insists that this is not a provocative move but rather a reflection that Kosovo is one of the many places in the former Yugoslavia where ordinary people are still living with the consequences of the Milosevic era. \"We were side players in the 1990s; the main player was Slobodan Milosevic. His political biography starts and ends in Kosovo - he is the tragic hero in the Serbia and Kosovo tragedy.\" Milosevic may have escaped justice at The Hague, where he died in custody before the conclusion of his genocide trial, but now the audience of the Slobodan Show have the chance to sit in judgement.

        "content": "Reboots generally make people groan. The entertainment landscape is littered with them - from Jumanji and Ocean's Eight on the big screen to Will & Grace and Roseanne on the small. Often, they're criticised as a lazy way for TV and film companies to cash in on an idea which they know already has an existing audience, regardless of how it might damage the reputation and integrity of the original. But every so often, there's an exception that proves the rule. The original Queer Eye For The Straight Guy launched in 2003, and saw five gay men give a straight man a makeover. And not just physically - they would also offer advice about how they might change their attitude or general demeanour. It was a ratings success, and ran until 2007. But Netflix's new iteration of the show has been going down a storm with critics and on social media - which is unusual for a reboot, and especially for one which has an arguably dated format. \"I think it's what people really need right now,\" Scott Bryan, BuzzFeed's TV editor, tells BBC News. \"There's not much else on TV that's so positive. You do have Bake Off, in a competitive format, but this show is very much about guys helping each other. \"It's unusual to see a man opening up, crying on camera, and other guys helping him go through a difficult situation. It's very supportive and you don't see that often on TV.\" For the latest incarnation of Queer Eye, producers have employed a whole new \"Fab Five\", who each have their own specialist areas - culture, fashion, grooming, food and design. The basic format of the show remains the same, but producers have moved it from New York to America's Deep South in an attempt to reach out to more conservative men, who may not necessarily have had much contact with gay people in the past. The new episodes have helped the show rack up a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, along with a string of high-profile fans - including Nick Grimshaw, Carrie Hope Fletcher, Jo Whiley, Sarah Millican and Modern Family's Jessie Tyler Ferguson. I wasn\u2019t expecting to be so emotionally invested in the new @QueerEye. These guys are building bridges & moving me to tears in ever episode. End of Twitter post by @jessetyler \"It's a makeover show, but it's unlike any other makeover show I've ever seen,\" Bryan says. \"With this, they spend equal, if not more, time working on the struggles of that person, it's as much about their emotional wellbeing as the physical space they live in. It makes viewers think very much about themselves, their own lives, what they need. \"For example, when I watched one episode, I went to go and buy stuff for my flat because for so long I felt I'd been neglecting buying stuff for myself. And the central theme of the episode had been about how you can look after yourself as well as others.\" Queer Eye 2018: What the critics say\nPeople were sceptical about the Queer Eye reboot. Cast members of the original show gave it their blessing and even filmed some new footage, but Carson Kressley said the new episodes wouldn't quite be the same. \"There's never a way to recreate that same magic, so it'll be a different kind of magic,\" he said last year when the new series was first announced. \"It was a great time for us, because people were like, 'Let's see what the gays are about', so it was kind of voyeuristic and now I hope we're a little more advanced.\" It's certainly true that society has progressed on the gay rights front since the original series came to an end. President Obama repealed Don't Ask Don't Tell in the US in 2011 - a policy which prevented gay people from serving in the military - while, in the UK, gay marriage was legalised in 2014. But, as several viewers have pointed out - there's still a long way to go with the perception of LGBT people in the public eye, and there's a risk that bringing the show back could actively set the gay community back - reinforcing camp and flamboyant stereotypes. \"My instinct is the new queer eye is regressive - it was nice in the early 00s but ultimately the concept is still 'gays know fashion and live healthy lives,'\" wrote Christopher Evans on Twitter. \"As a gay guy I find Queer Eye to be tantamount to Black Face. 'Oh, you're gay? You must know all about fancy foods and matching your belt with your shoes.' Can't believe this is on in 2018. Thought the fairy godmother gay best friend trope was outdated - guess not,\" added Nads. But, Bryan tells the BBC: \"There's no right or wrong way to act if you happen to be gay, so I don't accept any accusation that the guys in Queer Eye are too camp or stereotypical. You live life the way you want.\" He also pushes back against accusations on social media that the premise of the show itself is problematic - namely that a person must change their physical appearance or elements of their personality to make either themselves or someone else happy. \"They don't try to change a person too much - it's more about finding their positive qualities and enhancing them,\" Bryan says. \"The message of the whole show is improving what you have, not changing who you are. That's what makes it stand out.\" The current season is relatively short - eight episodes - and a second hasn't yet been officially confirmed (we checked in with Netflix on Thursday and this was still the case). But if critical and fan reaction is anything to go by, it's difficult to imagine this is the last we've seen of Queer Eye's Fab Five.

        "content": "Stalker Callum Blake-O'Brien created several fake social media accounts to send women what prosecutors described as \"unimaginably horrendous\" messages. One teenager left \"emotionally numb\" by his unrelenting abuse says he \"handpicked\" his victims to cause maximum distress. \"When I read it, I felt really sick. It was talking about rape and torture. \"I took a screenshot. It was extremely long and in extremely graphic detail.\" Gemma, not her real name, told the BBC how she got her first message from him one night in March 2017, when she was in her bedroom. \"I only read the first few lines; I couldn't read on and my parents read the rest of it. \"My mum said 'you should go to the police'. I was freaked out.\" Gemma, who was then 17, initially wondered if the message was \"some kind of joke\". She tried to find out who had sent it, but the communication was from an anonymous account that had been deactivated. \"By the time I read it, he had already created another account and starting sending other disturbing messages. \"The messages included one telling me I should not be afraid of dark alleyways because he preferred the daylight.\" They then started to include personal information about Gemma's family, including her father's work. One even mentioned her eye colour. \"I wrote back 'who is this?' and asked 'why are you doing this?'\" Blake-O'Brien, from Hereford, sent more abusive messages in response. Within days, her family had reported the messages to West Mercia Police. Though Gemma went to the police station armed with screenshots, she was disappointed by the officer's response.

Reports are made by people or authorities worried about online abuse, or the way someone is communicating online, and should be filed immediately. \"The dismissal by the police made me feel even more isolated,\" says Gemma, now aged 18. \"I did deactivate my account a few times and kept blocking him but he created new accounts. \"In all, he sent me about 75 to 100 messages from five different accounts. \"I became emotionally numb to the messages but the feeling he could hurt me never went away. \"I felt like I couldn't go out and became anxious - and I've never been anxious before.\" After a few weeks, the messages abruptly stopped. April and May passed without incident, but the reprieve was short-lived. \"I was on the phone to my friend when I got another message request in June. I knew exactly what it was and who it was from. I was devastated. \"It had given me a bit of false hope when it stopped between April and June and I thought he had finally got the message.\" Gemma reluctantly went back to the police but this time saw a female officer and a detective who she said \"took this seriously\". \"I think she understood his power and how I was feeling.\" The officers soon linked the case to a police report by another woman who had received similar messages. Two weeks later Blake-O'Brien was arrested. \"When I found out he was arrested in Hereford I completely broke down. It was the thought he could have walked past me multiple times,\" Gemma recalls. Her shock was further compounded when officers told her the name of the suspect - it was someone who had known her brother. \"He had handpicked all of us; either he knew us or had come into contact with us.\" The Crown Prosecution Service said Blake-O'Brien targeted several women. The 25-year-old knew some of the victims and was acquainted with others, it said. At Worcester Crown Court, he admitted counts against 10 women and was last month given a prison sentence of two and a half years. Seven offences were of stalking involving the fear of violence, while three involved sending an electronic communication of an indecent or grossly offensive nature. Blake-O'Brien will spent 15 months on licence, and was also handed a 10-year restraining order banning him from contacting any of his victims. He is further prohibited from using any device capable of accessing the internet unless it has the capacity to retain and display the history of online use. Though relieved her stalker has been bought to justice, looking back, Gemma feels upset about how the case was handled. She wants Facebook to introduce a helpdesk so people can easily report online abuse and believes the police, prosecution and defence counsel had a \"limited understanding\" of how social media worked. \"[That] shouldn't be the case as these crimes will increase in the future. \"I'm a teenage girl and I couldn't enjoy that whole year of my life.\" Det Insp Ross Jones, of West Mercia Police, urged anyone dissatisfied with how they were dealt with by officers to lodge a complaint with the force. He also praised the victims for coming forward. \"Their bravery played a vital role in achieving this custodial sentence. \"Despite this, I know that victims of such crimes can experience long-lasting effects on their mental health and wellbeing. \"All of the people who reported Blake-O'Brien's offences to us have been offered specialist counselling to help them. \"West Mercia Police works hard to ensure all officers know how to deal with reports of offences like this, and will continue to do so.\" ",

        "content": "Major trading partners of the US have condemned President Donald Trump for signing off new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. China described it as a \"serious attack\" on the system of international trade. French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire said there were \"only losers\" in a trade war. Mr Trump says the US has suffered from \"unfair trade\" and that the tariffs will boost US industry. The import duties - 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium - will go into effect in 15 days, although Canada and Mexico will be exempt while negotiations continue over the North America Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Mr Trump signed the declaration in a White House ceremony attended by American workers from both industries. What has the international reaction been?\nChina's steel and metals associations demanded retaliation, urging the government to target US imports including coal, agricultural products and electronics. Japan said the import duties would have a \"big impact\" on bilateral ties, while South Korea threatened to take the issue to the World Trade Organization. Canada, the largest supplier of steel and aluminium to the US, welcomed its exemption but said it would continue to press Washington to drop the tariffs. Mexico's Economy Minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, insisted the tariffs could not be linked to talks on Nafta. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem tweeted that, as a close ally of the US, the bloc should be excluded from the tariffs. The UK government said it would work with EU partners to consider \"the scope for exemptions\" while \"robustly\" supporting UK industries. What about inside the US?\nThere was strong opposition from within Mr Trump's own Republican Party, which is traditionally in favour of free trade. US House Speaker Paul Ryan denounced the new measures and said he feared \"unintended consequences\". Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said he believed the president had been \"misled\" by those advising him at the White House. Another Republican Senator, Jeff Flake, said he would draft and introduce a bill to nullify the tariffs, adding: \"I urge my colleagues to pass it before this exercise in protectionism inflicts any more damage on the economy.\" But those who backed Mr Trump's move included Democratic Senator Joe Manchin who said it was \"past time to defend our interests, our security and our workers in the global economy\". Why did Donald Trump do this?\nIn his election campaign, Mr Trump pledged to protect American workers and to rebuild the steel and aluminium industries. The two metals are \"the backbone of our nation... the bedrock of our defence-industrial base\", the president said at Thursday's signing ceremony. \"Our greatest presidents from Washington, to Jackson, to Lincoln, to McKinley and others - they protected our country from outside influence, from other countries coming in and stealing our wealth and stealing our jobs and stealing our companies,\" he said. \"And we're going to be very fair, we're going to be very flexible, but we're going to protect the American worker, as I said I would do in my campaign.\" Correspondents say Mr Trump is aiming to appeal to blue-collar voters in states such as Pennsylvania who turned away from the Democrats to support him in 2016. What could happen next?\nMr Trump has said that the US would \"win big\" in any trade war. Some countries are likely to take the US to court, arguing that the decision violates World Trade Organization rules. The White House, however, says that the national security rationale for the move is \"unassailable\" and national security considerations are allowed under WTO rules. The director of UK Steel said the tariffs would have a profound and detrimental impact on the UK steel sector. \"Imposing such measures on US allies in the name of national security is difficult to comprehend,\" Gareth Stace added.

        "content": "For a couple of weeks every month, Lucie seemed to become a different person - one suffering from countless mental and physical problems - and she couldn't understand why. She spent years looking for a doctor who could provide an answer, and it took a hysterectomy at the age of 28 to cure her. \"I would know that things would change before I even opened my eyes in the morning. It was just like this weight had been put on me,\" says Lucie. \"I did go to the doctor at one point and tell them that I thought I was possessed.\" Before puberty hit, Lucie had been a calm, happy, carefree child. But from the age of 13 she started to suffer from severe depression, anxiety and panic attacks. She also began to self-harm, and experienced extreme mood swings. So at 14, she was pulled out of her mainstream school and sent to live in an adolescent mental health unit. \"I had a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), and they mentioned bipolar quite a lot,\" she recalls. But none of these seemed to fit the cyclical nature of her symptoms. Things changed dramatically when she became pregnant at 16 with her son, Toby. \"Within a few months of being pregnant I left the hospital. My symptoms just seemed to disappear. I was happy. I felt really good. I felt mentally really, really well, which was a surprise.\" This lasted throughout her pregnancy and her time breastfeeding - but when her periods came back, so did her symptoms. A few years later, Lucie went back to college to study for A levels, but every few weeks she would feel unable to cope with the pressure, and eventually she quit. Then she embarked on a National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) to become a teaching assistant. This time she struggled through to the final stretch, stopping only two months before the end, when her symptoms became unbearable. But at 23 Lucie became pregnant again - with her daughter Bella. And again she felt mentally well, despite having to spend months in hospital with severe vomiting. After Bella was born, however, the symptoms she had been struggling with for years became even worse. Some were physical - joint and muscle pain, hypersensitivity to sounds, smell and touch, and extreme fatigue. Others were mental - invasive thoughts, irrational behaviour, forgetfulness, and overwhelming feelings of hopelessness. \"The scariest thing for me was depersonalisation, where I would feel like I was completely disconnected from my body, and like I was in a dream. At points I would find that I didn't recognise the people that were around me. I knew that I should know them, but their faces just didn't make any sense to me,\" she remembers. \"And at one point, when things were really really bad, I could hear my voice as someone else's, so when I was talking, I couldn't recognise my own voice or my own reflection.\" She frequently suffered from suicidal thoughts, which led her to take enormous risks, almost willing her own death. All these things occurred at monthly intervals, but it wasn't until her husband, Martin, offhandedly mentioned that he should keep quiet before her period, so as not to annoy her, that Lucie began to study the connection between her periods and her symptoms. \"It became pretty clear what was going on,\" she says. \"Within hours of bleeding, I would be fine. I would go from one extreme to the other. I would know that my period was coming and though I suffered from really, really heavy, awful periods, I felt at my best when I was bleeding. I even very carefully planned my wedding day so I would be bleeding because I knew that it was the only time I felt OK.\" Up to this point, Lucie had always assumed that her hormones exacerbated the mental health problems she had been diagnosed with. Now she began to wonder if they could be the cause. What is PMDD?\nSource: Nick Panay and Anna Fenton Armed with a list of about 30 symptoms and information she had printed off the internet, Lucie went to speak to her GP. At the time, she was consistently being told that she was suffering from post-natal depression after the birth of her daughter, but having suffered from depression in the past, Lucie strongly believed this wasn't the case. She had been medicated with anti-depressants, anti-anxiety medications and sleeping pills since she was a teenager. And now anti-psychotics were added to the mix. \"Every time I went, they would up something or add something. I was on a very hefty dose of anti-depressants. And I would say to them, 'I'm not depressed\u2026 this isn't depression, something else is happening.' I felt like I was losing my mind completely.\" Her GP sent her to see a mental health team, who told her that although some of her symptoms were affecting her mental health, she had a physical condition that could not be treated by a psychiatrist. But when Lucie asked her GP if she could see a gynaecologist, he scoffed at the idea and sent her back to the mental health team. This time they gave Lucie's condition a name: Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) - a severe form of Premenstrual syndrome (PMS). They wrote to the GP recommending that she be seen by a gynaecologist, and \"think about medication to prevent ovulation permanently\". This seemed like a possible breakthrough to Lucie, but her GP disagreed with the diagnosis - and insisted that she try every possible alternative treatment before he would refer her. She was put on various birth control pills, which made her feel constantly ill, and once the dosage limit was reached for one anti-depressant, another one was added on top. She was prescribed Mirtazapine, Sertraline, Prozac, Diazepam and sleeping tablets, all of which made her feel numb, and made it harder for her to argue her case. \"It was very difficult. I was at my worst, I couldn't go to the doctors, couldn't even string a sentence together. I couldn't hold a conversation. And then when I was well, I couldn't even remember what I had been like, the weeks prior to that would just be a blur.\" It was Lucie's husband, Martin, who ensured that she kept going back to see her doctor, and trying other GPs, in the hope of finding one that would listen to her. Eventually, she met one who recognised that none of her treatments had worked, and at long last referred her to a gynaecologist. The appointment took place almost a year after her diagnosis of PMDD and she was immediately offered injections, taken every four weeks, which would stop the production of oestrogen in her body, causing her to go into a temporary menopause. If these injections worked, it would confirm her diagnosis of PMDD. The first two weeks were incredibly difficult, with the worst of Lucie's symptoms flaring up constantly. But after that, as she was bracing for her monthly onslaught to begin, nothing happened, and she felt truly well for the first time in over a decade. \"Suddenly, everything changed\u2026 all my symptoms vanished,\" she says. \"I didn't realise how bad I was until they disappeared.\" Within two months, miraculously, she was able to come off of all the medication that she'd been on since her teens. Find out more\nAt her first follow-up appointment, five months after the injections had begun, her PMDD diagnosis was confirmed. And a new, more permanent, idea was raised - a hysterectomy, the surgical removal of Lucie's uterus. Prior to this, Lucie had been 100% certain that she wanted another child, but she quickly found her conviction wavering. \"It was really important to me but then I knew that would mean coming off this injection, letting my periods come back in, and everything that came with that - and it was just an impossible task,\" she says. \"I didn't think I would make it if I did that. I thought I'd end up suicidal again, doing ridiculous risky things. It was just a scary feeling.\" When Lucie discussed the possibility of a hysterectomy with Martin, he was supportive, but concerned that she might come to regret the decision - which would not only rule out any more children, but make Lucie's temporary menopause permanent. Lucie says she was worried about that too. But then they sat down to write a list of symptoms she had previously suffered from - and this time came up with a total of 42. \"Looking back over that list, there was just no way I could survive that again, knowing what life was supposed to be like, knowing what normal was,\" she says. \"I hadn't known what normal was until now. Martin had seen the change in me and our lives. It was so much better.\" As Lucie was coming to terms with the idea of having a hysterectomy, though, she experienced a nasty shock - her symptoms started to reappear. \"The symptoms were just creeping back bit by bit, which was scary, and I started feeling suicidal again. I was so desperate for the injections. I knew that they had helped but suddenly they weren't working, and I was trying to get them earlier and earlier every month. It was really like being addicted,\" she says. Lucie's gynaecologist then told her it wasn't possible that the injections were wearing off, and that her diagnosis of PMDD must have been inaccurate. She was told to stop taking the injections and go back to using birth control to help manage her hormones. \"I was thinking that I couldn't do that. I would rather die than go back to what I had been like before,\" she says. Help and support\nThe nurse that had been giving her injections for months recommended yet another GP, and this one agreed to Lucie's request to be referred to a specialist unit that she'd read about, at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London. A few months later, Lucie walked into the clinic and told her full story, going back nearly 15 years. When she mentioned that the injections had been wearing off, the doctor replied that this was, in fact, pretty common. That validation was a huge relief. She was offered an injection taken every 10 weeks instead of four, and for a while it worked so well that it seemed there would be no need for a hysterectomy. But then Lucie started suffering from a new problem brought on by the temporary menopause she had undergone - a loss of bone density that often leads to osteoporosis. She was prescribed Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) to counteract this but it made her extremely unwell. This made up Lucie's mind and in December 2016, at the age of 28, she had a hysterectomy. Up until the day of her surgery she found herself questioning whether this was the right decision. But in the year since the operation, despite occasional migraines, she has been able to do more than in the 10 years before it. She has finished her NVQ and is now working as a teaching assistant, doing the very job she never thought she would be well enough to do. \"I still haven't quite got my head around the fact that this is how it is always going to be,\" she says. Lucie doesn't feel bitter about the time it took for her to get a diagnosis. \"I got there in the end. I just feel lucky that it was something that could be cured and that I did get to see the best people. I know that when I was younger, the symptoms were all because of PMDD - I have no doubts about that whatsoever - but it just wasn't recognised then like it is now. \"It was just shrugged off as, 'Oh no you know everybody gets PMS. Everybody feels like that sometimes,' and that's not the case.\" She does wish, though, that she'd been taken more seriously by her doctors after the birth of her daughter, when her symptoms were at their most severe. \"I wish I'd been listened to more, really. I just wish they'd taken into account what I was saying. If you're feeling like I was feeling, something is quite badly wrong.\" The surgery has affected not only Lucie, but all those around her. Martin, a musician, is able to spend more time working, because Lucie can now take responsibility for the children. Toby is old enough to appreciate the positive change in his mother; Lucie hopes that Bella does not remember her the way she was before her treatment for PMDD began. They are now so much happier as a family. \"Is this what everyone else is like all the time? They don't know how lucky they are,\" Lucie says. \"And it's nothing I'll ever ever take for granted.\" Join the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter ",

        "content": "Asian markets moved higher on Friday, on hopes that North Korean nuclear tensions might be easing. Investors responded to US President Donald Trump accepting an invitation for face-to-face talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. There was already some optimism on the markets after Mr Trump earlier left the door open for possible exemptions to US tariffs on steel and aluminium. South Korea's Kospi index had its best day in almost ten months, adding 1.5%. And Japan's Nikkei 225 index initially rose 2.5% but later shed some of the gains. A sigh of relief is no surprise\nAnalysis by Karishma Vaswani, Asia Business Correspondent Investors in the region have been watching the potential conflict between the US and North Korea for months now. And news that the two could meet by May of this year is being greeted with a sigh of relief by many. And that shouldn't come as a surprise. Nobody wants a conflict on the Korean peninsula to break out, especially between arguably two of the world's most volatile leaders. East Asian economies would be almost certainly be hit, because of integrated supply chains in the region. It's a region central to global shipping and manufacturing, so any escalation of the current tensions could disrupt trade and economic activity. But perhaps what's more interesting, is what a potential meeting between \"Rocket Man\" and the \"Dotard\" says about just how badly the North Korean economy may be doing as sanctions bite. Read more from Karishma: Did sanctions push N Korea into US talks? Hong Kong's Hang Seng edged 0.9% higher, while China's mainland indexes also made small gains. Australia's All Ordinaries rose 0.4%. The South Korean won climbed slightly, while the Japanese yen slipped against the US dollar. That is not unexpected given the yen is a safe haven currency, with investors tending to seek out riskier assets with better returns when things appear more stable. ",

Mr Trump signed the declaration in a White House ceremony attended by American workers from both industries. What has the international reaction been?\nChina's steel and metals associations demanded retaliation, urging the government to target US imports including coal, agricultural products and electronics. Japan said the import duties would have a \"big impact\" on bilateral ties, while South Korea threatened to take the issue to the World Trade Organization. Canada, the largest supplier of steel and aluminium to the US, welcomed its exemption but said it would continue to press Washington to drop the tariffs. Mexico's Economy Minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, insisted the tariffs could not be linked to talks on Nafta. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem tweeted that, as a close ally of the US, the bloc should be excluded from the tariffs. The UK government said it would work with EU partners to consider \"the scope for exemptions\" while \"robustly\" supporting UK industries. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the US could have \"no complaints\" about their bilateral trading relationship and his government would be \"relentless\" in pursuing an exemption from the tariffs. What about inside the US?\nThere was strong opposition from within Mr Trump's own Republican Party, which is traditionally in favour of free trade. US House Speaker Paul Ryan denounced the new measures and said he feared \"unintended consequences\". Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said he believed the president had been \"misled\" by those advising him at the White House. Another Republican Senator, Jeff Flake, said he would draft and introduce a bill to nullify the tariffs, adding: \"I urge my colleagues to pass it before this exercise in protectionism inflicts any more damage on the economy.\" But those who backed Mr Trump's move included Democratic Senator Joe Manchin who said it was \"past time to defend our interests, our security and our workers in the global economy\". Why did Donald Trump do this?\nIn his election campaign, Mr Trump pledged to protect American workers and to rebuild the steel and aluminium industries. The two metals are \"the backbone of our nation... the bedrock of our defence-industrial base\", the president said at Thursday's signing ceremony. \"Our greatest presidents from Washington, to Jackson, to Lincoln, to McKinley and others - they protected our country from outside influence, from other countries coming in and stealing our wealth and stealing our jobs and stealing our companies,\" he said. \"And we're going to be very fair, we're going to be very flexible, but we're going to protect the American worker, as I said I would do in my campaign.\" Correspondents say Mr Trump is aiming to appeal to blue-collar voters in states such as Pennsylvania who turned away from the Democrats to support him in 2016. What could happen next?\nMr Trump has said that the US would \"win big\" in any trade war. Some countries are likely to take the US to court, arguing that the decision violates World Trade Organization rules. The White House, however, says that the national security rationale for the move is \"unassailable\" and national security considerations are allowed under WTO rules. The director of UK Steel said the tariffs would have a profound and detrimental impact on the UK steel sector. \"Imposing such measures on US allies in the name of national security is difficult to comprehend,\" Gareth Stace added.

        "content": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has invited Donald Trump to meet him, an unprecedented overture which the US leader has said he will accept. The shock announcement was made by senior South Korean officials in Washington, who passed on a letter from the North Korean leader. They said Mr Kim had also agreed to halt nuclear and missile tests and was \"committed to denuclearisation\". It appears to be a major breakthrough after months of threats of violence. However analysts warn that such summits are usually the result of years of careful diplomacy so remain sceptical about what these rapidly arranged talks can achieve. Mr Trump said the development was \"great progress\" but that sanctions will remain in place until a firm agreement is reached. North Korea has not yet issued any official comment on the week's developments. South Korean National security adviser Chung Eui-yong, speaking outside the White House after the meeting, said: \"I told President Trump that at our meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said he's committed to denuclearisation.\" He added: \"President Trump appreciated the briefing, and said he would meet Kim Jong-un by May to achieve permanent denuclearisation.\" How did we reach this point?\nNorth Korea has been isolated on the international stage for decades because of its well-documented human rights abuses and its pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws. It says it needs nuclear weapons and missiles because its survival is under threat. It has carried out six nuclear tests, though it's still unclear whether it could carry out a long-distance nuclear attack. But South Korea's hosting of the Winter Olympics gave an unexpected window for diplomacy, as rare inter-Korean talks were held to facilitate the North's carefully choreographed attendance. The South Korean delegation then held landmark talks with Mr Kim in Pyongyang earlier this week. They returned with a statement saying the North was willing to denuclearise if it felt \"it has no reason to retain nukes\". What has North Korea actually pledged?\nThere are four main things: The BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says it is important to note that North Korea has not yet promised to abandon its nuclear weapons completely. It also remains unclear exactly what it is asking for in return. The North has halted missile and nuclear tests during previous talks before, only to resume when it lost patience or felt it was not getting what it demanded. The last point is also significant. The US has had tens of thousands of military personnel in South Korea since the end of the Korean War. The massive annual joint war games infuriate the North, because it believes they are preparation for invasion. They were due to take place during the Olympics but have been suspended for now. Is this a victory for Trump?\nMr Trump has repeatedly belittled Kim Jong-un, and last year threatened him with \"fire and fury the likes of which the world has never seen before\" if he continued to threaten the US. He has at times said there is no point in talking to North Korea. But Mr Chung made a point of saying it was Mr Trump's \"maximum pressure policy\" which had brought the parties to this point. Christopher Hill, formerly the US negotiator with North Korea, told the BBC Mr Trump may have frightened Pyongyang by \"looking at options that many American presidents would not have gone for\". But he has also shown flexibility to meet people other presidents might have dismissed, he says. Our correspondent says Kim Jong-un has also scored a propaganda win, first with the Olympics and now by being seen to reach out to the US. What about the other major players?\nThe South's statement also credited \"international solidarity\" for reaching this point. That is likely in part a reference to international sanctions, which have increased with each North Korean show of force. China, North Korea's main economic supporter, has in recent months toughened up its dealings with the North, including on key areas like petroleum and oil. This is thought to be putting a major strain on the North. It has consistently pushed for all parties to talk so will welcome this development. Japan, which saw North Korean missiles fly over its territory twice last year, is routinely distrustful of Pyongyang's motives, saying it must commit to giving up its weapons before any talks can take place. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe welcomed news of a Trump-Kim meeting, but said: \"We will keep putting maximum pressure until North Korea takes concrete actions toward denuclearisation.\" Have talks like this happened in the past?\nNo sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader, but there have been repeated attempts to get North Korea to denuclearise. The last major effort - the Six Party talks - collapsed in 2008, largely because North Korea refused to allow inspectors to verify that it had shut down its nuclear programme. A number of bids to restart the talks also collapsed, including in 2012 when North Korea launched another rocket, two weeks after announcing a \"leap day\" agreement with the US. ",

        "content": "The 2018 Winter Paralympics will feature almost 600 athletes competing in 80 events across six sports. It represents a notable increase on the 547 athletes who took part in the Sochi Games four years ago. All have their own stories to tell of how they got to be part of one of the biggest sporting events in the world. BBC Sport looks at some of the British team members hoping to shine in Pyeongchang, plus some of the international stars bidding to make an impact. Para-alpine skiing pairing Menna and Jen, as they are better known, will be one of GB's leading medal hopes on their Paralympic debuts. Fitzpatrick, 19, has been skiing since childhood despite being born with congenital retinal folds that mean she has no vision in her left eye and limited sight in her right eye. Her guide Kehoe (34) is also an experienced skier and has been given time off from her role as an officer with the Royal Engineers to pursue the partnership with Fitzpatrick, which sees them descend the slopes at speeds of up to 100km/h while communicating via bluetooth headsets. Pyeongchang will be particularly special for Kehoe, who was on track to compete as a guide at the Sochi Paralympics before she suffered a serious knee injury. The pair have been in impressive form this season and will go in all five events in Pyeongchang as they chase a first Paralympic medal. Less than two years after taking up skiing, the 28-year-old Scot finds himself ready to take on arguably the most gruelling Winter Paralympic challenges in the cross country and biathlon events. Meenagh, a former Scotland under-18 rugby player, lost both his legs after stepping on an IED (improvised explosive device) while serving with the Army in Afghanistan. He took up rowing as part of his rehabilitation and became part of the GB Para-rowing squad, narrowly missing out on a place at the Rio Games, and also represented his country in the sport at the 2014 and 2016 Invictus Games, and in athletics at the 2017 event. But it is in nordic skiing that he will make his Games debut as Britain's first Paralympic representative in the sport for 20 years. Traditionally, the pathway from newcomer to elite competitor in the sport is between eight and 10 years - Meenagh has exceeded expectations by qualifying for Pyeongchang in a particularly short timescale, and is set to take part in six events across the two disciplines. Like Meenagh, Pick saw his life changed forever in Afghanistan. He was 18 and on his first tour of duty in the country when he suffered serious injuries to his leg after an explosion in January 2010. After lengthy treatment in the UK, his leg was amputated below the knee in August 2011. Pick, now 26, saw snowboarding on television while he was recovering and tried it for the first time on a trip to Colorado before going on an instructor's course. He made his competition debut in 2014 and has developed rapidly as he worked towards becoming one of the trio, along with Ben Moore and James Barnes-Miller, who will become Britain's first Paralympic snowboarders. Pick won silver in the banked slalom at last year's World Championships and is targeting going one better in South Korea, where he will also compete in the snowboard cross event. Cross country specialist McKeever has 10 Winter Paralympic gold medals to his name already and while Gert Schonfelder's all-time record of 16 will be beyond his reach for these Games, success in Pyeongchang will see him inch closer to the German's mark. The 38-year-old, who will be at his fifth Games, competes in the visually impaired category, having started to lose his sight aged 19 as a result of Stargardts disease, a congenital condition. He looked set to create history in 2010 when, as well as being named on the Canadian Paralympic team, he was selected for the country's Olympic squad. However, he was controversially not chosen to race in the 50km classic event - a decision that he said left him \"crushed\" - but he recovered from that disappointment to win three Paralympic golds, and repeated the feat four years later in Sochi. McKeever's immense talent means finding a suitable guide for him presents plenty of challenges. His older brother Robin filled the role for a number of years before current guide Graham Nishikawa took over for Sochi. His back-up guide Russell Kennedy already has experience of Pyeongchang having competed with the Canadian Olympic team last month. If 23-year-old skier Walsh wants some advice on how to deal with the pressure of a Paralympic Games, he does not have to go too far for help. Walsh is a good friend of Olympic giant slalom champion Mikaela Shiffrin - the pair went to pre-school in Vail, Colorado together and Shiffrin's mother was Walsh's first ski teacher - and they have stayed friends since. Nine years ago Walsh was diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma - a bone and soft tissue cancer. Part of his lungs and pelvis were removed and his Olympic dreams were at an end. But he recovered and took Shiffrin to his school prom in 2012 and, after going to watch his friend in action in Sochi four years ago, he learned to love skiing again, joining the US Paralympic team in December 2015. Walsh finished 10th in the super-G and 19th in the super combined at last year's World Championships and while a gold medal would be a big ask, he will have one of the biggest stars of the sport cheering him all the way. With both Paralympic and Winter Paralympic titles to his name, Bowden has nothing to prove - but Canada's failure to win Para-ice hockey gold since 2006 is an extra incentive for the 34-year-old to keep going at the elite level. Bowden, who was born with a condition similar to spina bifida, won wheelchair basketball gold with Canada at the 2004 Paralympics in Athens but Para-ice hockey (or sledge hockey, as it has previously been known) has always had a special part in his life. Two years after his first Paralympic title, he made it a double by helping Canada claim gold in Turin as they beat Norway in the final. The team disappointed on home soil in 2010, finishing without a medal but won bronze four years ago, watching on as the United States took up the mantle of the top team in the world. But with Bowden, previously a star in attack, now playing a more defensive role, Canada beat their North American rivals 4-1 to win last year's World Championship and they are confident they can finish on top of the podium again on the biggest stage of all. Four years ago in Sochi, Mentel-Spee was on top of the world after winning the first ever female Para-snowboarding gold medal in the snowboard cross event, but the subsequent four years have been a challenge for the Dutch woman. She was a talented able-bodied snowboarder in her younger days, competing at World Cup level, and qualified for the 2002 Olympics before being diagnosed with cancer and having her leg amputated as part of her treatment. Mentel-Spee relearned her snowboarding skills and earned victory in Sochi as well as two world titles in snowboard cross and banked slalom in 2017, which should have put her in good stead for Pyeongchang. Since then, however, she has needed more treatment for cancer and has had surgery twice in the past six months, most recently in January. But the 45-year-old wants to take her place in South Korea. \"For me it is more important to compete there than to win,\" she says. \"Just being at the event with all my friends and showcasing the sport, that is the most important thing for me. I'm not really thinking about the results.\" Masters' story echoes that of fellow US Paralympian Tatyana McFadden. She too was adopted from an orphanage as a youngster (aged seven) and brought to the US by her adoptive mother before going on to shine on the sporting stage. She was born in Ukraine near the Chernobyl nuclear plant and suffered from a number of birth defects to her limbs which eventually resulted in both legs being amputated and her having to have multiple reconstructive surgeries to her hands. But she found a passion for sport, winning bronze in rowing at the London 2012 Paralympics before switching to cross country skiing and taking a bronze and a silver home from Sochi. The 28-year-old tried another sport for Rio, claiming two top-five finishes in Para-cycling as she recovered from a back injury, but she could not stay away from the nordic disciplines. She has improved her shooting skills for the biathlon events and as well as three cross country golds at last year's World Championships, added another gold and a bronze in the biathlon. The US has never won Paralympic gold in women's cross country or biathlon events and the smart money is on Masters being the first to achieve the feat in Pyeongchang. The fact Germany finished second in the medal table at the Sochi Winter Paralympics four years ago was largely down to Schaffelhuber. The sit-skier won gold medals in all five events on the Para-alpine skiing programme, to make up more than half of her nation's overall gold medal tally of nine. The 25-year-old, who was born with incomplete paraplegia which developed into complete paraplegia in 2009, will be competing in her third Games as she bids to defend all five titles. At last year's World Championships she won three golds and two silvers and in Pyeongchang will renew rivalries with the woman who beat her in those two events, Claudia Losch of Austria. The German says she is going to retire after Pyeongchang but can she go out on a high with another clean sweep of medals?\u2003 Of all the teams at the Pyeongchang Winter Paralympics, the one that will surely attract the most interest is the one made up of eligible Russian Para-athletes. While the Russian Paralympic Committee remains suspended after a report found evidence of state-sponsored doping, in January the International Paralympic Committee said it would allow selected athletes who had met strict conditions to compete as neutrals at the Games - just as the International Olympic Committee had done with last month's Winter Olympics. Known as neutral Paralympic athletes (NPA), they will compete under the Paralympic flag and the Paralympic anthem will be played in any ceremony. Athletes, who must have had at least two anti-doping tests in the past six months, will compete in alpine skiing, biathlon, cross country, snowboard and wheelchair curling. The Russian team topped the medal table in Sochi in 2014 with 80 medals, including 30 golds, but the 2018 team has a different look. Among those who have been named on the team are alpine skier Aleksei Bugaev - who won two golds, two silvers and a bronze in the standing category in Sochi and five golds at the 2015 World Championships - and fellow double Sochi gold medallists Aleksandra Frantseva and Valerii Redkozubov, who both compete in the visually impaired category. It will be a first appearance at a Winter Paralympics for North Korea after the country was given two invitational slots by the IPC for the Para-nordic skiing events. The two athletes who will take part are Ma You-chul and Kim Jung-hyun, who both compete in the seated events. Both made their international debuts at January's World Cup in Oberried, Germany, with funding from the Asian Paralympic Committee and the Agitos Foundation, and finished 34th and 35th respectively in the 7.5km event and 26th and 27th in the 15km event. However, unlike at the Olympics, they will not march with South Korean athletes under a unified flag at the opening ceremony. North Korea competed for the first time at the 2012 Paralympics with one swimmer taking part and three athletes represented the country at the 2016 Paralympics. It is not yet clear whether the loud and co-ordinated North Korean support evident during the Olympics will be in place for the Paralympics. ",

        "content": "The Winter Paralympics are set to take place in Pyeongchang, with the opening ceremony on Friday and competition starting the following day. The event will feature 670 athletes competing for 80 medals across six sports. Here's the day-by-day guide to what to look out for at Pyeongchang 2018 - and the likely highlights for Great Britain and other leading nations. Medals to be decided Para-alpine skiing: 6 Biathlon: 6 The opening day of competition features two of Britain's main medal hopes starting their campaigns in the Para-alpine skiing by taking on the downhill course at the Jeongseon Alpine Centre. Millie Knight and guide Brett Wild are the downhill world champions but have not hit top form this season, while Menna Fitzpatrick and Jen Kehoe will be chasing a medal on their Paralympic debut. The main challenge is likely to come from defending Paralympic champion Henrieta Farkasova of Slovakia. In the seated and standing classes, Anna Schaffelhuber of Germany and France's Marie Bochet will also be aiming to retain their titles. Scott Meenagh, who only took up Nordic skiing 18 months ago, will be making his Paralympic debut in the 7.5km seated biathlon - one of six medals up for grabs in the sport on day one - and one of six events the Scot is entered for across biathlon and cross-country skiing. Wheelchair curling starts with Great Britain, bronze medallists four years ago, facing defending world champions Norway in their opening round-robin match, while the first session of Para-ice hockey games also take place. British interest (all times GMT) 00:30-03:30: Para-alpine skiing - men's and women's downhill [Millie Knight & Brett Wild, Menna Fitzpatrick & Jen Kehoe, James Whitley, Chris Lloyd] 01:00-02:35: Biathlon - men's 7.5km sitting [Scott Meenagh] 05:35-08:00: Wheelchair curling [GB v Norway] Medals to be decided: Para-alpine skiing: 6 Cross-country skiing: 2 It will be a busy start to the Games for the alpine skiers. After the downhill on day one, it is the super-G on day two. Four years ago in Sochi, Kelly Gallagher created history with guide Charlotte Evans when they won Britain's first Winter Paralympic gold medal in the event. Since then, the Northern Irish skier has overcome the departure of Evans from the partnership and suffered a number of injuries - including a dislocated elbow and fractured ribs in a training crash, which kept her out of last year's World Championships. It hasn't been the smoothest of preparations but Gallagher and new guide Gary Smith will be hoping to put on a good display. The cross-country skiing programme starts with American Oksana Masters, a strong favourite in the women's 12km sitting event. Masters was born in Ukraine, near the Chernobyl nuclear plant, and was adopted at the age of seven by American speech therapy professor Gay Masters. She won rowing bronze at London 2012 - before switching to skiing and winning silver and bronze in Sochi. A gold would complete her medal collection nicely. The USA are seeking a third successive Paralympic gold in the Para ice hockey - their first opponents are Japan, who won silver in 2010 but missed out on Sochi. British interest (all times GMT) 00:30-04:00: Para alpine skiing - men's and women's Super-G [Millie Knight & Brett Wild, Menna Fitzpatrick & Jen Kehoe, Kelly Gallagher & Gary Smith, James Whitley, Chris Lloyd] 00:35-03:00: Wheelchair curling [GB v Switzerland] 01:00-02:35: Cross-country skiing - men's 15km sitting [Scott Meenagh] 10:35-13:00: Wheelchair curling [GB v Finland] Medals to be decided: Para-snowboard: 5 Cross-country skiing: 4 Snowboard is the newest Winter Paralympic discipline - with another event and further categories added to the programme in Pyeongchang. Having had no athletes in Sochi four years ago, Britain will have Owen Pick, Ben Moore and James Barnes-Miller creating history when they go in the snowboard cross event. Pick lost his leg while serving in Afghanistan in 2011; Moore and Barnes-Miller go in the events for athletes with arm impairments. Moore won a World Championship bronze in snowboard cross in 2015 while Barnes-Miller was fourth in last year's worlds. Elsewhere, Canadian skiing star Brian McKeever will bid to add to his 10 Paralympic cross-country gold medals in the 20km freestyle event for visually impaired athletes. The wheelchair curling round-robin continues, with GB facing Sweden and then Canada.

Millie Knight and Brett Wild won silver at last year's worlds in the women's VI category but Menna Fitzpatrick and Jen Kehoe are second in the world rankings behind Henrieta Farkasova of Slovakia and her guide Natalia Subrtova. In the men's standing category, Aleksei Bugaev is the defending Paralympic champion. The Russian - competing under the Neutral Paralympic Athlete (NPA) banner - has been cleared to take part in Pyeongchang. However, Australian Mitchell Gourley, Italy's Robin Cuche and Markus Salcher of Austria filled the top three places at last year's Worlds and lead the rankings going into the Games. In the biathlon, the middle-distance events (10km/12.5km) take place with Scott Meenagh, who lost both legs serving in Afghanistan, going for Britain in the 12.5km seated event, where Germany's Martin Fleig will hope to add Paralympic gold to his world title. It's a busy day for the GB wheelchair curling team of Aileen Neilson, Gregor Ewan, Bob McPherson, Hugh Nibloe and Angie Malone. The round-robin phase of the competition continues and they face games against Slovakia and the NPA.

Britain's James Whitley, who will be competing in his second Games at the age of 20, will be hoping for a top-10 place, having finished 15th four years ago. Whitley was born without hands and has had multiple operations to construct fingers, but he has limited feeling and movement, and skis without poles. The visually impaired category could be a battle between Canada's Mac Marcoux, 20, and Italian teenager Giacomo Bertagnolli. Elsewhere, it's a big day of action at the cross-country skiing - with the sprint events taking place across all six categories and taking in qualification, semi-finals and finals. In qualification, athletes race against the clock but in the semi-finals and finals, it is a mass start involving six athletes in the seated and standing categories, and four athletes plus guides in the visually impaired categories, which can result in thrills and spills. Four years ago, Canada's Brian McKeever fell at the start of his race and found himself adrift of the rest of the field but still managed to recover and win gold.

The women's seated category could be an all-German battle with defending champion Anna Schaffelhuber up against team-mate Anna-Lene Forster. However, Austria's Claudia Losch finished the season as the overall World Cup winner and could spoil the German party. Favourite for the standing event will be France's Marie Bochet, who has dominated this season. It is also an important day in the wheelchair curling, with the final three rounds of pool games taking place before the semi-finals. The final four in the Para-ice hockey will also be in action with the USA hoping to make it three gold medals in a row in the event.

In the event, competitors have three runs down the course, with the best time counting. In the women's events, American Brenna Huckaby, who travels on the World Cup circuit with her 17-month-old daughter, will be favourite in the SB-LL1 category - while the Dutch duo of Lisa Bunschoten and Bibian Mentel-Spee look strong in the SB-LL2 event. A Mentel-Spee victory would be an emotional one, as she has been having radiation treatment for cancer over the past couple of years. It is another busy and gruelling day for the biathletes, including Britain's Scott Meenagh, as they go in the longest event, which covers 12.5km for the women and 15km for the men. The wheelchair curling reaches the semi-final stage, with Great Britain hoping to be involved.

Sit-skier Christoph Kunz won gold in his category four years ago and will be a contender again but Jeroen Kampschreur of the Netherlands is the world champion, one of his three world titles. Kampschreur, who is the first Dutch Para-alpine skier to win a world title, is a double above-the-knee amputee and also played wheelchair basketball at junior level for the Netherlands. In the cross-country events, the men's 10km classic event provides another medal chance for Canada's Brian McKeever, who is bidding for a fifth successive title in the event. France's Thomas Clarion won silver behind McKeever at last year's worlds - but was more than 30 seconds behind the Canadian. Medals are up for grabs in the wheelchair curling - four years ago, it was Norway who beat Russia to the gold, with Great Britain taking bronze.

Again, Henrieta Farkasova and guide Natalia Subrtova will provide the main challenge at the Jeongseon Alpine Centre. There should be a good contest in the standing category between defending champion Marie Bochet from France and German rival Andrea Rothfuss, who is the current world champion. Rothfuss, who took slalom gold in Sochi four years ago, won her world title by 0.71 seconds and another close race is expected. The last of the 80 medals will be awarded in the Para-ice hockey event, in which the USA have won gold at the past two Games.

        "content": "A serial sex attacker dubbed the M25 rapist has died in prison. Antoni Imiela, 63, who preyed upon woman and girls across south-east England, was given seven life terms in 2004. In January, it emerged he was being considered for release after serving a total of 14 years in jail. The Prison Service said Imiela, who is understood to have had a heart condition, died at HMP Wakefield on Thursday. There were no suspicious circumstances, it added. 'Dangerous as ever'\nImiela had been living in Appledore, near Ashford, Kent, when he raped three girls and four women in 2001 and 2002. The locations of his attacks, in Kent, Surrey, Hertfordshire and west London, earned him the M25 rapist moniker. Imiela's trial at Maidstone Crown Court heard how he targeted strangers, dragging victims into secluded areas where he threatened to kill them. His youngest victim was 10 years old. He was ordered to serve at least eight years in jail, and was later handed another 12-year term when his DNA was linked to an unsolved 1987 attack. Speaking after the 2012 case, detectives said they believed it was likely Imiela had attacked further victims. Judge John Bevan QC, who sentenced Imiela for the second time, said he remained as dangerous as he had been when he was first jailed. A Prison Service spokeswoman said: \"As with all deaths in custody, there will be an independent investigation by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman.\" ",

        "content": "Complaints that MPs bullied, harassed and intimidated House of Commons staff have been uncovered in an investigation by BBC Two's Newsnight. The programme spoke to dozens of female workers who described aggressive and threatening behaviour. Among those accused of bullying was Speaker John Bercow, whose private secretary left her job in 2011. He rejects the allegation that he behaved in such a manner, \"either eight years ago, or at any other time\". \"Any suggestion to the contrary is simply untrue,\" a spokesman said. Newsnight has been investigating claims of bullying and harassment by MPs of members of the House of Commons Service - a group commonly known in Westminster as \"clerks\". One of the stories that emerged was that of Kate Emms - who worked as a private secretary to Mr Bercow, starting in mid-2010. Colleagues who spoke to Newsnight claimed that Mr Bercow, who is also the MP for Buckingham, had shouted at her and undermined her in front of other staff. This left her unable to continue working in what was a key Commons post, they said. She was signed off sick in early 2011 and then returned to a new post elsewhere in Parliament. Commons authorities were told that she had been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Two other MPs named in the investigation were Labour's Paul Farrelly and Conservative Mark Pritchard. Witnesses told Newsnight that Mr Farrelly's continued criticism over several years of Emily Commander, a clerk on two committees that the MP sat on, made her job impossible. One witness recalled his behaviour on a science committee trip to Italy in 2004, saying: \"He was a complete and utter bully. \"He wound her up like a screw and reduced her to tears. The more he upset her, the more he enjoyed it, the more he kept turning the screw. He was very aggressive. It felt like no one had the ability or authority to intervene. Everybody knew it was wrong.\" The two crossed paths again when Mr Farrelly was on the culture, media and sport committee in 2010. Documents obtained by Newsnight show she complained then of a campaign of continual belittling and undermining and that she told her bosses that she had \"repeated nightmares about going on Committee visits with Mr Farrelly and being criticised by him for having neglected tiny details\". Mr Farrelly has denied any bullying. He told Newsnight: \"In 2012 allegations were made about me having bullied a clerk to the committee during the compilation of the phone-hacking report. These allegations were investigated and not upheld.\" \"Despite this, I apologised if I had inadvertently upset the clerk who had suffered stress. The policy under which they were investigated was considered to be so unfair to those complained about that it was immediately withdrawn and replaced by another policy.\" Newsnight also spoke to several clerks about Mr Pritchard, MP for the Wrekin, who say he was notorious for shouting at and berating clerks. One witness told how he \"exploded\" at a female staff member ahead of a trip to California because he was unhappy with the choice of hotel he had been booked into. He then angrily swore at the same woman on the trip itself. Mr Pritchard said: \"I understand, over the past several years the House authorities have addressed numerous complaints about MPs, but they have also informed me they have no record of any complaints against me, and if they had, I would have been notified. Other women working in the House told Newsnight they had been pushed against walls, forcibly kissed, groped and slapped by MPs. They said that complaints had not been taken seriously, and that they fear that when complaints are made it is the clerks who are made to move jobs while the MPs are left in place. Since 2014, when the current HR processes were introduced, no complaints raised by staff members have been escalated to formal channels, such as mediation. The House of Commons said in a statement: \"The House of Commons takes pride in being a responsible and supportive employer, and does not tolerate bullying or harassment of any kind.\" \"In 2014 the House of Commons introduced the revised Respect policy which is specifically designed to combat bullying and harassment of House employees by MPs or their staff. In addition, we have implemented a range of measures to complement the respect policy, including training for managers on how to address reports of bullying or harassment and a team of trained bullying and harassment contacts for staff to approach should they have concerns.\" Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson called for a \"through independent investigation\", telling Newsnight the claims raised \"very significant questions\" about the workings of the Respect policy. Ms Swinson, a member of the cross-party working group on an independent complaints and grievance policy, said the suggestion was Parliament \"doesn't have modern and professional standards... [and] many MPs see themselves as above other members of staff\". Writing on Twitter, Labour MP Jess Phillips, said Commons staff had told her of similar experiences and the claims \"must be investigated, independently and fairly\". I met with clerks and house staff today and talked to them about they way they get treated, this was reflected in tonights piece. This must be investigated, independently and fairly. https://t.co/88WrJrGBSK End of Twitter post by @jessphillips A longer version of this story is available here. ",

        "content": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has invited Donald Trump to meet him, an unprecedented overture which the US leader has said he will accept. The shock announcement that a meeting could take place as early as May was made by South Korean officials in Washington. They passed a verbal message from Mr Kim to Mr Trump and said North Korea's leader \"committed to denuclearisation\". South Korea's President Moon Jae-in said it was \"a milestone for peace\". \"If President Trump and Chairman Kim meet following an inter-Korean summit, complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will be put on the right track in earnest,\" he said. South Korean National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong, who earlier this week met Mr Kim in Pyongyang, announced the development after briefing Mr Trump at the White House. \"President Trump appreciated the briefing, and said he would meet Kim Jong-un by May to achieve permanent denuclearisation,\" he said. North Korea has not yet issued any official comment on the week's developments. Mr Trump said the development was \"great progress\" but that sanctions on North Korea would remain in place until a firm agreement is reached. His press secretary Sarah Sanders said they would meet \"at a place and time to be determined\". However analysts remain sceptical about what such rapidly arranged talks - normally the culmination of years of diplomacy - can achieve. How did we reach this point?\nNorth Korea has been isolated for decades because of its well-documented human rights abuses and its pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws. It has carried out six nuclear tests, and has missiles which could reach the US. It says it needs these to ensure its survival. But South Korea's hosting of the Winter Olympics gave an unexpected window for diplomacy. Rare inter-Korean talks were held to facilitate the North's carefully choreographed attendance. South Korea then held landmark talks with Mr Kim in Pyongyang this week, returning home saying the North was willing to give up its nuclear weapons if it felt it had no reason to keep them. What has North Korea pledged?\nThere were four main elements to the statement: The BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says it is important to note that North Korea has not yet promised to abandon its nuclear weapons completely. It also remains unclear exactly what it is asking for in return. The North has halted missile and nuclear tests during previous talks before, only to resume when it lost patience or felt it was not getting what it demanded. The last point is also significant. The US has had tens of thousands of military personnel in South Korea since the end of the Korean War. The massive annual joint war games infuriate the North, because it believes they are preparation for invasion. They were due to take place during the Olympics but have been suspended for now. Is this a victory for Trump?\nMr Trump has repeatedly belittled Kim Jong-un, and last year threatened him with \"fire and fury\" if North Korea continued to threaten the US. He has at times said there is no point in talking to North Korea. But Mr Chung made a point of saying it was Mr Trump's \"maximum pressure policy\" which had brought the parties to this point, a gesture which the president is likely to appreciate. Our correspondent says Kim Jong-un has also scored a propaganda win, first with the Olympics and now by being seen to reach out to the US. What about the other major players?\nThe South's statement also credited \"international solidarity\" for reaching this point. That is likely in part a reference to international sanctions, which have increased with each North Korean show of force. China, North Korea's main economic supporter, has in recent months toughened up its dealings with the North, including on key areas like petroleum and oil. This is thought to be putting a major strain on the North. It has consistently pushed for all parties to talk so will welcome this development. Japan, which saw North Korean missiles fly over its territory twice last year, welcomed news of a Trump-Kim meeting. But Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan would \"keep putting maximum pressure until North Korea takes concrete actions toward denuclearisation\". Have talks like this happened in the past?\nNo sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader, but there have been repeated attempts to get North Korea to denuclearise. The last major effort - the Six Party talks - collapsed in 2008, largely because North Korea refused to allow inspectors to verify that it had shut down its nuclear programme. A number of bids to restart the talks also collapsed, including in 2012 when North Korea launched another rocket, two weeks after announcing a \"leap day\" agreement with the US. ",

        "content": "NHS chiefs and health unions in England are understood to be close to agreeing a three-year pay deal. Talks on an award for all health staff - except for doctors and dentists - are said to be constructive and going well. The government has already said it would scrap the 1% cap on public sector pay, with the chancellor indicating more funding for higher wages. Health unions are keen to negotiate a pay deal well above the cap imposed by ministers in recent years. But BBC health editor Hugh Pym says he understands that the Department of Health and Social Care, and NHS Employers - the group representing healthcare bosses - are concerned about recruitment problems and ready to agree an award that makes up some of the lost ground. It is believed that there have been positive talks between the two sides and a deal is not far off. But reports of a 6.5% pay award over three years in return for NHS staff losing a day's holiday have been described as premature. Any outline agreement between the two sides will need final approval from ministers. The Treasury has indicated that in return for extra money to fund the pay deal some updating of working practices may be required. In September, unions representing nurses and other NHS staff wrote to the chancellor to demand a 3.9% pay rise and an extra \u00a3800 to make up for the \"cut\" they had seen in recent years. They said pay has fallen by 15% since 2010 once inflation is taken into account. It came after ministers agreed to give police officers a 1% rise plus a 1% bonus, with prison officers getting a 1.7% rise - both funded from existing budgets. ",

        "content": "Major trading partners of the US have condemned President Donald Trump for signing off new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. China described it as a \"serious attack\" on the system of international trade. French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire said there were \"only losers\" in a trade war. Mr Trump says the US has suffered from \"unfair trade\" and that the tariffs will boost US industry. The import duties - 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium - will go into effect in 15 days, although Canada and Mexico will be exempt while negotiations continue over the North America Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Mr Trump signed the declaration in a White House ceremony attended by American workers from both industries. What has the international reaction been?\nChina's steel and metals associations demanded retaliation, urging the government to target US imports including coal, agricultural products and electronics. Japan said the import duties would have a \"big impact\" on bilateral ties, while South Korea threatened to take the issue to the World Trade Organization. Canada, the largest supplier of steel and aluminium to the US, welcomed its exemption but said it would continue to press Washington to drop the tariffs. Mexico's Economy Minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, insisted the tariffs could not be linked to talks on Nafta. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem tweeted that, as a close ally of the US, the bloc should be excluded from the tariffs. The UK government said it would work with EU partners to consider \"the scope for exemptions\" while \"robustly\" supporting UK industries. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the US could have \"no complaints\" about their bilateral trading relationship and his government would be \"relentless\" in pursuing an exemption from the tariffs. What about inside the US?\nThere was strong opposition from within Mr Trump's own Republican Party, which is traditionally in favour of free trade. US House Speaker Paul Ryan denounced the new measures and said he feared \"unintended consequences\". Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said he believed the president had been \"misled\" by those advising him at the White House. Another Republican Senator, Jeff Flake, said he would draft and introduce a bill to nullify the tariffs, adding: \"I urge my colleagues to pass it before this exercise in protectionism inflicts any more damage on the economy.\" But those who backed Mr Trump's move included Democratic Senator Joe Manchin who said it was \"past time to defend our interests, our security and our workers in the global economy\". Why did Donald Trump do this?\nIn his election campaign, Mr Trump pledged to protect American workers and to rebuild the steel and aluminium industries. The two metals are \"the backbone of our nation... the bedrock of our defence-industrial base\", the president said at Thursday's signing ceremony. \"Our greatest presidents from Washington, to Jackson, to Lincoln, to McKinley and others - they protected our country from outside influence, from other countries coming in and stealing our wealth and stealing our jobs and stealing our companies,\" he said. \"And we're going to be very fair, we're going to be very flexible, but we're going to protect the American worker, as I said I would do in my campaign.\" Correspondents say Mr Trump is aiming to appeal to blue-collar voters in states such as Pennsylvania who turned away from the Democrats to support him in 2016. What could happen next?\nMr Trump has said that the US would \"win big\" in any trade war. Some countries are likely to take the US to court, arguing that the decision violates World Trade Organization rules. The White House, however, says that the national security rationale for the move is \"unassailable\" and national security considerations are allowed under WTO rules. The director of UK Steel said the tariffs would have a profound and detrimental impact on the UK steel sector. \"Imposing such measures on US allies in the name of national security is difficult to comprehend,\" Gareth Stace added.

        "content": "Hello. Here's your morning briefing: Breakthrough? Trump agrees to talks with Kim\nThey've verbally sparred from afar over the last year or so, as tensions have risen over the testing of missiles and trade sanctions have been intensified. But it's been announced that US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un are ready to have face-to-face talks. Mr Trump has accepted an invitation to a meeting, while Mr Kim has agreed to halt nuclear testing. It's quite a development after so much rancour, which Mr Trump has called \"great progress\". But the BBC's Laura Bicker, in Seoul, says it remains to be seen what North Korea wants. And how did this change come about - was it all about sanctions? US criticised over metal tariffs\nWhile Donald Trump's relations with North Korea appear to be improving, he's coming in for criticism abroad for signing off tariffs of 25% on steel imports to the US, and 10% on aluminium imports. China's called this a \"serious attack\" on international trade, while France's government has said there will be \"only losers\" from a potential escalation in protectionism. Some have predicted this could end in an all-out trade war, with senior figures in Mr Trump's Republican Party stating their opposition to the tariffs. But the president says they're important in cutting the US's trade deficit. So, what impact might they have when they come into effect in 15 days' time? And what links Mr Trump to Abraham Lincoln and Ferris Bueller?

Wagamama blamed an \"inadvertent misunderstanding\" over the rules on funding uniforms. TGI Fridays said its payments related to a shoe allowance.

        "content": "It's been an iconic music magazine for 66 years and for fans it marks the end of an era. The weekly print version of NME magazine has been released for the final time. The publication will only be available online due to rising production costs and a \"tough\" advertising market. Newsbeat's been taking a look at some of its most memorable front covers, starting with the original... The first cover: 7 March 1952\nThe New Musical Express's first edition was almost 66 years ago to the day. It featured musicians Vera Lynn, Alan Dean, Harry Gold and Ted Heath, plus news that the government would soon introduce commercial radio in Britain for the first time. Fab Four: The Beatles, 11 October 1963\nBy the 1960s, NME was boasting the \"world's largest circulation of any music paper\". It was helped along in 1963 by a band on the brink of becoming one of the biggest pop acts ever. The Thin White Duke: David Bowie, 15 May 1976\nPhotographer Andrew Kent documented David Bowie's career for two years from 1975, following him on his Station To Station album tour. His pictures captured the rise of Bowie's Thin White Duke persona. The battle of Britpop: Blur vs Oasis, 12 August 1995\nAt the height of the Britpop era in the 90s, the tabloids and some sections of the media asked people to choose between two bands: Blur or Oasis. The bands' rivalry dominated the charts - and the headlines - when Blur's song Country House beat Roll With It by Oasis to number one. Rehab to recovery: Eminem, 17 July 2010\nEminem featured on NME's cover shortly after the release of his album Recovery. The album was a follow-up to his 2009 release Relapse and spent seven weeks at number one in the UK. Back to black: Amy Winehouse, 30 July 2011\nNME's black and white cover paid tribute to Amy Winehouse after her death shook the music world in the summer of 2011. She was only 27 years old. Holy smoke: Rihanna, 18 September 2015\nRihanna's front cover marked a significant moment in the magazine's history. The magazine was relaunched as a free publication featuring the star - and was handed out in shops, train stations and universities. She's the one: Dua Lipa, 19 May 2017\nIn 2017, NME described Dua Lipa as being on the path to \"pop's premier league\". They were right - less than a year later, she's had a UK number one and won two Brit awards. Election coverage: Jeremy Corbyn, 2 June 2017\nA week before the general election, NME waded into the world of politics when it put Jeremy Corbyn on its cover. As part of an interview with the magazine, the Labour leader promised to \"get rid of student fees altogether\" if his party got into power. The final cover (for now): Stefflon Don, 9 March 2018\nStefflon Don represents Great Britain on the magazine's final weekly cover. But fans will still be able to pick up special issues in print, such as new paid-for series NME Gold. Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

        "content": "Asian markets rallied on Friday, on hopes that North Korean nuclear tensions might be easing. Investors responded to US President Donald Trump accepting an invitation for face-to-face talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. There was already some optimism on the markets after Mr Trump earlier left the door open for possible exemptions to US tariffs on steel and aluminium. South Korea and Japan's main markets began well but later shed some gains. By late afternoon trading Seoul's Kospi index was about 1% ahead. Meanwhile Japan's Nikkei 225 index - which initially rose by 2.5% - closed only 0.5% higher. A sigh of relief is no surprise\nAnalysis by Karishma Vaswani, Asia Business Correspondent Investors in the region have been watching the potential conflict between the US and North Korea for months now. And news that the two could meet by May of this year is being greeted with a sigh of relief by many. And that shouldn't come as a surprise. Nobody wants a conflict on the Korean peninsula to break out, especially between arguably two of the world's most volatile leaders. East Asian economies would be almost certainly be hit, because of integrated supply chains in the region. It's a region central to global shipping and manufacturing, so any escalation of the current tensions could disrupt trade and economic activity. But perhaps what's more interesting, is what a potential meeting between \"Rocket Man\" and the \"Dotard\" says about just how badly the North Korean economy may be doing as sanctions bite. Read more from Karishma: Did sanctions push N Korea into US talks? Hong Kong's Hang Seng edged 0.9% higher, while China's mainland indexes also made small gains. The South Korean won climbed slightly, while the Japanese yen slipped against the US dollar. That is not unexpected given the yen is a safe haven currency, with investors tending to seek out riskier assets with better returns when things appear more stable. ",

        "content": "It's been an iconic music magazine for 66 years and for fans it marks the end of an era. The weekly print version of NME magazine has been released for the final time. The publication will only be available online due to rising production costs and a \"tough\" advertising market. Newsbeat's been taking a look at some of its most memorable front covers, starting with the original... The first cover: 7 March 1952\nThe New Musical Express's first edition was almost 66 years ago to the day. It featured musicians Vera Lynn, Alan Dean, Harry Gold and Ted Heath, plus news that the government would soon introduce commercial radio in Britain for the first time. Fab Four: The Beatles, 11 October 1963\nBy the 1960s, NME was boasting the \"world's largest circulation of any music paper\". It was helped along in 1963 by a band on the brink of becoming one of the biggest pop acts ever. The Thin White Duke: David Bowie, 15 May 1976\nPhotographer Andrew Kent documented David Bowie's career for two years from 1975, following him on his Station To Station album tour. His pictures captured the rise of Bowie's Thin White Duke persona. The battle of Britpop: Blur vs Oasis, 12 August 1995\nAt the height of the Britpop era in the 90s, the tabloids and some sections of the media asked people to choose between two bands: Blur or Oasis. The bands' rivalry dominated the charts - and the headlines - when Blur's song Country House beat Roll With It by Oasis to number one. Rehab to recovery: Eminem, 17 July 2010\nEminem featured on NME's cover shortly after the release of his album Recovery. The album was a follow-up to his 2009 release Relapse and spent seven weeks at number one in the UK. Back to black: Amy Winehouse, 30 July 2011\nNME's black and white cover paid tribute to Amy Winehouse after her death shook the music world in the summer of 2011. She was only 27 years old. Holy smoke: Rihanna, 18 September 2015\nRihanna's front cover marked a significant moment in the magazine's history. The magazine was relaunched as a free publication featuring the star - and was handed out in shops, train stations and universities. She's the one: Dua Lipa, 19 May 2017\nIn 2017, NME described Dua Lipa as being on the path to \"pop's premier league\". They were right - less than a year later, she's had a UK number one and won two Brit awards. Election coverage: Jeremy Corbyn, 2 June 2017\nA week before the general election, NME waded into the world of politics when it put Jeremy Corbyn on its cover. As part of an interview with the magazine, the Labour leader promised to \"get rid of student fees altogether\" if his party got into power. The final cover (for now): Stefflon Don, 9 March 2018\nStefflon Don represents Great Britain on the magazine's final weekly cover. But fans will still be able to pick up special issues in print, such as new paid-for series NME Gold. Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

        "content": "Pictures of the police officer who fell critically ill after responding to the attack on the former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury appear on several front pages. Det Sgt Nick Bailey's recovery makes the lead for the Daily Express and the Sun. The Sun says the officer joined the Wiltshire force in 2002 and was commended in 2016 for helping to catch and convict a rapist. The Daily Mail reports that when he rushed to the scene on Sunday, he was responding to a routine call about what was initially believed to be two drunks acting strangely on a bench. World Cup boycott\nMeanwhile, the Times says detectives are understood to be considering the possibility that the Russian pair were poisoned at Mr Skripal's house in the city, where a cordon has been extended and a fingertip search is being carried out. It also says Theresa May is expected - within days - to name Russia as the chief suspect in the attempted murders of the Skripals. It reports Britain is in talks with the US and Nato about a co-ordinated response to Russia if President Putin's government is found to be behind the poisoning. \"Should we boycott Putin's World Cup?\" asks the Daily Mail's main headline. It says ministers are under growing pressure to order a boycott of the tournament in Russia this summer. The paper quotes the former Labour minister, Chris Bryant - chairman of the all-party parliamentary Russia group - as saying it would be \"very difficult\" for England's football team to compete if Moscow is proved to be linked to the attack. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning The Fox News website describes Kim Jong-un's proposal for talks with President Trump as a stunning invitation. And the US president accepted it within two hours, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. For the New York Times, it is an audacious diplomatic overture that would bring together two strong-willed, idiosyncratic leaders who have traded threats of war. It says Mr Trump and Mr Kim share a penchant for bold, dramatic moves, and their personal participation in a negotiation could take it in unexpected directions. The Daily Telegraph reports that half the adult population could be put on blood pressure drugs under proposals being considered by the NHS watchdog. It says the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence is studying evidence that has led the US to change its advice, making millions more patients eligible for daily drugs to cut their risk of heart attack. Trials in America found that aggressively using drugs to lower blood pressure could reduce the risk of death among people aged over 50 by almost a quarter, the paper adds. 'Pest from the West'\nThere are many pictures of accidents and traffic chaos on the roads caused by Thursday's snowfall in several parts of the country. The Daily Mail says the weather split Britain into two - with the north getting a final taste of winter and spring finally rearing its head in the south. And after last week's Siberian big freeze courtesy of the \"Beast from the East\", the Daily Mirror and the Sun christen the Atlantic front that brought the snow the \"Pest from the West\". Finally, a solution has been found for tech addicts who cannot bear to spend time away from their phones and Facebook - even while taking a bath or shower. The Times says online shoppers are extolling the benefits of a clear plastic shower curtain liner with pockets to display multiple devices. The paper says most shoppers have left five star reviews. \"Where has this been all my life? was one contribution. But a dissenting voice left a one star review, sighing: \"This makes me sad for our future\". ",

        "content": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump are to meet in person as early as May, it has been announced, an extraordinary overture after months of mutual hostility. News of the meeting was delivered by South Korean officials after talks with Mr Trump at the White House. They passed a verbal message from Mr Kim, saying the North Korean leader was \"committed to denuclearisation\". South Korea's President Moon Jae-said the news \"came like a miracle\". \"If President Trump and Chairman Kim meet following an inter-Korean summit, complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula will be put on the right track in earnest,\" he said. The development came days after the South Korean delegation met Mr Kim in Pyongyang. Speaking outside the White House after briefing Mr Trump, South Korean National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong passed on a message that Mr Kim was \"committed to denuclearisation\" and had \"pledged that North Korea will refrain from any further nuclear or missile tests\". Mr Trump said the development was \"great progress\" but that sanctions on North Korea would remain in place until a firm agreement was reached. In a statement sent to the Washington Post, North Korea's UN ambassador said the \"courageous decision\" of Mr Kim would helped secure \"peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and the East Asia region\". How did we reach this point?\nNorth Korea has been isolated for decades because of its well-documented human rights abuses and its pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws. It has carried out six nuclear tests, and has missiles which could reach the US. It says it needs these to ensure its survival. But South Korea's hosting of the Winter Olympics gave an unexpected window for diplomacy. Rare inter-Korean talks were held to facilitate the North's carefully choreographed attendance. South Korea then held landmark talks with Mr Kim in Pyongyang this week, returning home saying the North was willing to give up its nuclear weapons if it felt it had no reason to keep them. What has North Korea pledged?\nThere were four main elements to the statement delivered by Mr Chung: The BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says it is important to note that North Korea has not yet promised to abandon its nuclear weapons completely. It also remains unclear exactly what it is asking for in return. The North has halted missile and nuclear tests during previous talks before, only to resume when it lost patience or felt it was not getting what it demanded. The last point is also significant. The US has had tens of thousands of military personnel in South Korea since the end of the Korean War. The massive annual joint war games infuriate the North, because it believes they are preparation for invasion. They were due to take place during the Olympics but have been suspended for now. Is this a victory for Trump?\nMr Trump has repeatedly belittled Kim Jong-un, and last year threatened him with \"fire and fury\" if North Korea continued to threaten the US. He has at times said there is no point in talking to North Korea. But Mr Chung made a point of saying it was Mr Trump's \"maximum pressure policy\" which had brought the parties to this point, a gesture which the president is likely to appreciate. Our correspondent says Kim Jong-un has also scored a propaganda win, first with the Olympics and now by being seen to reach out to the US. What about the other major players?\nPresident Moon, who is due to meet Mr Kim in April, said the Trump-Kim meeting \"will be recorded as a historic milestone that realised peace on the Korean Peninsula\". South Korea, he said, would make the most of an \"opportunity that came like a miracle. The South's statement also credited \"international solidarity\" for the breakthrough, likely in part a reference to the ever-increasing international sanctions on North Korea. China, North Korea's main economic supporter, has in recent months toughened up its dealings with the North, including on key areas like petroleum and oil. This is thought to be putting a major strain on the North. It has consistently pushed for all parties to talk so will no doubt welcome news of a Trump-Kim meeting. Japan, which saw North Korean missiles fly over its territory twice last year, responded with cautious optimism. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan would \"keep putting maximum pressure until North Korea takes concrete actions toward denuclearisation\", and said he hoped to meet Mr Trump ahead of the Kim summit. Have talks like this happened in the past?\nNo sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader, but there have been repeated attempts to get North Korea to denuclearise. The last major effort - the Six Party talks - collapsed in 2008, largely because North Korea refused to allow inspectors to verify that it had shut down its nuclear programme. A number of bids to restart the talks also collapsed, including in 2012 when North Korea launched another rocket, two weeks after announcing a \"leap day\" agreement with the US. There is no indication yet of where talks might take place, but the Korean border and Beijing as seen as likely options. ",

        "content": "Reboots generally make people groan. The entertainment landscape is littered with them - from Jumanji and Ocean's Eight on the big screen to Will & Grace and Roseanne on the small. Often, they're criticised as a lazy way for TV and film companies to cash in on an idea which they know already has an existing audience, regardless of how it might damage the reputation and integrity of the original. But every so often, there's an exception that proves the rule. The original Queer Eye For The Straight Guy launched in 2003, and saw five gay men give a straight man a makeover. And not just physically - they would also offer advice about how they might change their attitude or general demeanour. It was a ratings success, and ran until 2007. But Netflix's new iteration of the show has been going down a storm with critics and on social media - which is unusual for a reboot, and especially for one which has an arguably dated format. \"I think it's what people really need right now,\" Scott Bryan, BuzzFeed's TV editor, tells BBC News. \"There's not much else on TV that's so positive. You do have Bake Off, in a competitive format, but this show is very much about guys helping each other. \"It's unusual to see a man opening up, crying on camera, and other guys helping him go through a difficult situation. It's very supportive and you don't see that often on TV.\" For the latest incarnation of Queer Eye, producers have employed a whole new \"Fab Five\", who each have their own specialist areas - culture, fashion, grooming, food and design. The basic format of the show remains the same, but producers have moved it from New York to America's Deep South in an attempt to reach out to more conservative men, who may not necessarily have had much contact with gay people in the past. The new episodes have helped the show rack up a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, along with a string of high-profile fans - including Nick Grimshaw, Carrie Hope Fletcher, Jo Whiley, Sarah Millican and Modern Family's Jessie Tyler Ferguson. I wasn\u2019t expecting to be so emotionally invested in the new @QueerEye. These guys are building bridges & moving me to tears in ever episode. End of Twitter post by @jessetyler \"It's a makeover show, but it's unlike any other makeover show I've ever seen,\" Bryan says. \"With this, they spend equal, if not more, time working on the struggles of that person, it's as much about their emotional wellbeing as the physical space they live in. It makes viewers think very much about themselves, their own lives, what they need. \"For example, when I watched one episode, I went to go and buy stuff for my flat because for so long I felt I'd been neglecting buying stuff for myself. And the central theme of the episode had been about how you can look after yourself as well as others.\" Queer Eye 2018: What the critics say\nPeople were sceptical about the Queer Eye reboot. Cast members of the original show gave it their blessing and even filmed some new footage, but Carson Kressley said the new episodes wouldn't quite be the same. \"There's never a way to recreate that same magic, so it'll be a different kind of magic,\" he said last year when the new series was first announced. \"It was a great time for us, because people were like, 'Let's see what the gays are about', so it was kind of voyeuristic and now I hope we're a little more advanced.\" It's certainly true that society has progressed on the gay rights front since the original series came to an end. President Obama repealed Don't Ask Don't Tell in the US in 2011 - a policy which prevented gay people from serving in the military - while, in the UK, gay marriage was legalised by the coalition government in 2014. But, as several viewers have pointed out - there's still a long way to go with the perception of LGBT people in the public eye, and there's a risk that bringing the show back could actively set the gay community back - reinforcing camp and flamboyant stereotypes. \"My instinct is the new queer eye is regressive - it was nice in the early 00s but ultimately the concept is still 'gays know fashion and live healthy lives,'\" wrote Christopher Evans on Twitter. \"As a gay guy I find Queer Eye to be tantamount to Black Face. 'Oh, you're gay? You must know all about fancy foods and matching your belt with your shoes.' Can't believe this is on in 2018. Thought the fairy godmother gay best friend trope was outdated - guess not,\" added Nads. But, Bryan tells the BBC: \"There's no right or wrong way to act if you happen to be gay, so I don't accept any accusation that the guys in Queer Eye are too camp or stereotypical. You live life the way you want.\" He also pushes back against accusations on social media that the premise of the show itself is problematic - namely that a person must change their physical appearance or elements of their personality to make either themselves or someone else happy. \"They don't try to change a person too much - it's more about finding their positive qualities and enhancing them,\" Bryan says. \"The message of the whole show is improving what you have, not changing who you are. That's what makes it stand out.\" The current season is relatively short - eight episodes - and a second hasn't yet been officially confirmed (we checked in with Netflix on Thursday and this was still the case). But if critical and fan reaction is anything to go by, it's difficult to imagine this is the last we've seen of Queer Eye's Fab Five.

        "content": "England head coach Eddie Jones' decision to pick the same back row that faced Scotland when they meet France has been described as \"funny and amazing\" by former flanker Serge Betsen. England conceded nine turnovers at the breakdown as they lost 25-13 to Scotland in their previous Six Nations outing. Jones has kept faith with Courtney Lawes, Chris Robshaw and Nathan Hughes for the trip to the Stade de France in Paris on Saturday. \"It's really funny Jones has challenged the back row to beat France with that style of play,\" Betsen, who won 63 caps for France between 1997 and 2007, told BBC Sport. \"France will target the breakdown and are going to follow what Scotland managed to do against England. \"In the back row England have got some second rows who maybe have less speed and who are really tall. It's a handicap for them in that aspect of the game. \"The French forwards are really effective in that area and especially a player like [prop] Jefferson Poirot. \"Wenceslas Lauret and Yacouba Camara are experts in the back row and Marco Tauleigne will bring a lot of dynamism in open play.\" What is the breakdown?\nThe breakdown is the period between open play and the formation of a ruck where players compete for possession. Once a ruck has formed, no player may handle the ball. Robshaw was the only one of the three to claim a turnover against Scotland, with fellow flanker Lawes conceding three. Over the first three rounds of the 2018 tournament, England have the worst success rate of all the Six Nations sides at the ruck. \"At the moment, with the players we have available, this is the best back row we have,\" Jones told BBC Radio 5 live. \"Technically we got the breakdown wrong against Scotland and they were much better than us in that area, but we'll get it right for France. \"We didn't adjust to the referee's interpretations, which is disappointing and something we can learn from.\" England will face a France side buoyed by the return to form of centre Mathieu Bastareaud. At over 19st, he is the heaviest back in this year's Championship, but he won a game-high four turnovers in the 34-17 win over Italy in Paris. Bastareaud made a rampant return to midfield against the Azzurri - his first Six Nations appearance since 2015 - setting up one try and scoring another. The 29-year-old, who has won 43 caps, spent more than two years out of the international set-up between 2015 and 2017. He also missed the opening two rounds of this year's tournament after being banned for three weeks a for a homophobic slur. \"The way he played against Italy, you could see he'd had to wait for that,\" Toulon team-mate and England wing Chris Ashton told Matt Dawson's Rugby Show. \"He had to wait some time to get back in and get a starting place. He took his chance and played unbelievably well.\" Bastareaud's expertise at the breakdown is another element England must contain if they are to keep their hopes of a third successive Six Nations title alive on Saturday. \"The only way you can target Bastareaud is by making the game fast,\" said Ashton. \"If they manage to do that then I think there could be areas in and around the whole French team.\" Asked about Bastareaud's personality off the pitch, Ashton said: \"He's quite quiet day to day. He picks his moments when he's lively and he's well respected in the team. \"This season he's been our captain and done a good job for us. \"He rides a small moped to training and everybody that sees him on it waves to him. It's almost like Rocky going through the streets from the film.\" ",

The American, 36, reached the second round at Indian Wells with a 7-5 6-3 victory over Kazakhstan's Zarina Diyas. It was her first singles match on the Tour since she won the 2017 Australian Open while pregnant. \"I'm a little rusty but it doesn't matter,\" said the 23-time Grand Slam singles champion. \"It definitely wasn't easy but it was good.\" Williams was given a standing ovation as she walked onto court. Her husband Alexis Ohanian was in the crowd as she set up a second-round match with 29th-seeded Dutch player Kiki Bertens. Williams gave birth to daughter Alexis Olympia on 1 September. She says post-childbirth health complications - including blood clots in her lungs - were almost fatal. Williams missed this year's Australian Open because she did not consider herself ready for the tournament. Speaking after her win over Diyas, she said: \"It was incredible. It's been over a year and a kid later. \"I'm just out here on this journey doing the best I can.\" Media playback is not supported on this device BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller Williams did not fluff too many lines on her latest opening night. Given she had not played a competitive singles match for 404 days, this was an impressive return. Diyas showed plenty of resilience, saving five break points - but crucially not a sixth - in the first set, and twice breaking back when Williams hit the front in the second. Williams' serve proved a strong foundation, especially in the first set, and there were some powerful and sweetly struck winners amid some inevitable rust. The best part of 10,000 people were in Stadium Court 1 to watch Williams' return. One was her sister Venus, a potential third-round opponent. ",

        "content": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump are to meet in person as early as May, it has been announced, an extraordinary overture after months of mutual hostility. News of the meeting was delivered by South Korean officials after talks with Mr Trump at the White House. They passed a verbal message from Mr Kim, saying the North Korean leader was \"committed to denuclearisation\". South Korea's President Moon Jae-in said the news \"came like a miracle\". \"If President Trump and Chairman Kim meet following an inter-Korean summit, complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula will be put on the right track in earnest,\" he said. The development came days after the South Korean delegation met Mr Kim in Pyongyang. Speaking outside the White House after briefing Mr Trump, South Korean National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong passed on a message that Mr Kim was \"committed to denuclearisation\" and had \"pledged that North Korea will refrain from any further nuclear or missile tests\". Mr Trump said the development was \"great progress\" but that sanctions on North Korea would remain in place until a firm agreement was reached. In a statement sent to the Washington Post, North Korea's UN ambassador said the \"courageous decision\" of Mr Kim would helped secure \"peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and the East Asia region\". There is no indication yet of where the Trump-Kim talks might take place, but the Korean border's demilitarised zone (DMZ) and Beijing are seen as likely options. Moon's huge gamble\nAnalysis by BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul President Moon Jae-in has acknowledged there are obstacles ahead. He is managing expectations and so much can go wrong. His approval ratings took a hit during the Winter Olympics after he integrated the women's hockey team with players from the North and met a general from Pyongyang who had been accused of masterminding deadly attacks on South Koreans, though they have since rebounded. These talks are a huge gamble with a communist state which is hard to read. But if, just if, he helps pull it off, it may reduce the threat of nuclear war and he could win himself a Nobel Peace prize. If all fails, it is back to brinkmanship. Read Laura's piece in full How did we reach this point?\nNorth Korea has been isolated for decades because of its well-documented human rights abuses and its pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws. It has carried out six nuclear tests, and has missiles which could reach the US. It says it needs these to ensure its survival. But South Korea's hosting of the Winter Olympics gave an unexpected window for diplomacy. Rare inter-Korean talks were held to facilitate the North's carefully choreographed attendance. South Korea then held landmark talks with Mr Kim in Pyongyang this week, returning home saying the North was willing to give up its nuclear weapons if it felt it had no reason to keep them. What has North Korea pledged?\nThere were four main elements to the statement delivered by Mr Chung: The BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says it is important to note that North Korea has not yet promised to abandon its nuclear weapons completely. It also remains unclear exactly what it is asking for in return. The North has halted missile and nuclear tests during previous talks before, only to resume when it lost patience or felt it was not getting what it demanded. The last point is also significant. The US has had tens of thousands of military personnel in South Korea since the end of the Korean War. The massive annual joint war games infuriate the North, because it believes they are preparation for invasion. They were due to take place during the Olympics but have been suspended for now. Is this a victory for Trump?\nMr Trump has repeatedly belittled Kim Jong-un, and last year threatened him with \"fire and fury\" if North Korea continued to threaten the US. He has at times said there is no point in talking to North Korea. But Mr Chung made a point of saying it was Mr Trump's \"maximum pressure policy\" which had brought the parties to this point, a gesture which the president is likely to appreciate. Our correspondent says Kim Jong-un has also scored a propaganda win, first with the Olympics and now by being seen to reach out to the US. What about the other major players?\nPresident Moon, who is due to meet Mr Kim in April, said the Trump-Kim meeting \"will be recorded as a historic milestone that realised peace on the Korean Peninsula\". The South's statement also credited \"international solidarity\" for the breakthrough, probably in part a reference to the ever-increasing international sanctions on North Korea. China, North Korea's main economic supporter, has in recent months toughened up its dealings with the North, including on key areas like petroleum and oil. This is thought to be putting a major strain on the North. It has consistently pushed for all parties to talk so will no doubt welcome news of a Trump-Kim meeting. Japan, which saw North Korean missiles fly over its territory twice last year, responded with cautious optimism. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan would \"keep putting maximum pressure until North Korea takes concrete actions toward denuclearisation\", and said he hoped to meet Mr Trump ahead of the Kim summit. Have talks like this happened in the past?\nNo sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader, but there have been repeated attempts to get North Korea to denuclearise. The last major effort - the Six Party talks - collapsed in 2008, largely because North Korea refused to allow inspectors to verify that it had shut down its nuclear programme. A number of bids to restart the talks also collapsed, including in 2012 when North Korea launched another rocket, two weeks after announcing a \"leap day\" (29 February) agreement with the US that had promised food aid in return for inspections and a moratorium on missile tests.

Reality Check verdict: This is true - there are more bed spaces in refuges. But there are fewer refuges and more or less the same proportion of women are being turned away as they were in 2010. As proposed laws to protect victims of domestic abuse were announced, Home Secretary Amber Rudd drew attention to a 10% increase in bed spaces in refuges since 2010. The number of bed spaces in refuges in England has gone up from 3,467 in 2010 to 3,798 in 2017, which is about a 10% increase. That information comes from Routes to Support - the database of domestic abuse services in the UK. However, the same database shows the overall number of refuges available has fallen from 296 in 2010, to 276 in 2017 - a cut of 7%. This is part of a trend towards fewer, larger services that cover a bigger geographical area. In many cases, this means more women need to be provided with support by the same number of staff. According to the domestic abuse charity Women's Aid, these larger contracts have also meant tenders to run refuge services have increasingly been going to big organisations which don't specialise in domestic abuse provision, like housing associations. And funding for refuges has also fallen. More than three-quarters of local authorities with responsibility for providing refuges have cut their funding since 2010, by at least \u00a37m overall, according to Freedom of Information requests by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. Councils have a legal duty to provide accommodation to people made homeless by domestic abuse. The combination of less funding per bed and fewer specialist providers means some women cannot access bed spaces because they need specialist support for things like mental health or drug and alcohol use, which refuges are no longer able to provide. Women's Aid says its most recent annual survey suggested that 60% of referrals to refuges were turned down in 2016-17 amounting to more than 10,000 instances of women being turned away. This proportion has remained more or less unchanged since 2010 despite the increase in bed numbers. The charity Refuge, the largest provider of refuges for women and children escaping domestic violence in England, says that 80% of its services have suffered funding cuts since 2011 and overall its funding on average has been cut by a third. How has the law changed in England and Wales?\nThe draft Domestic Abuse Bill currently under consultation follows a number of changes to the law since 2010. You might have heard the startling statistic that two women are killed by partners or ex-partners every week in England and Wales. This comes from the Office for National Statistics, which produces official crime figures. It says that between April 2011 and March 2016, 415 women were killed by partners or ex-partners which equates to 1.6 women per week, a figure which is rounded up to two per week. We can't quantify exactly how common domestic abuse is. The latest available figures from the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which is a face-to-face survey of households, estimated that around four in five victims (79%) of partner abuse did not report it to the police. The most recent Crime Survey of England and Wales suggests 6% of women aged 16 to 59 had been victims of non-physical abuse, threats, force, sexual assault or stalking by a partner. This is equivalent to 992,000 victims last year. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter ",

        "content": "Claim: In the past six months, the rate of executions in Saudi Arabia has doubled. Reality Check verdict: Emily Thornberry's office clarified to BBC Reality Check that she meant the past eight months, not six months. Saudi Arabia does not release official statistics on the number of executions it carries out. However, her figures are broadly correct, according to prominent human rights organisations. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry made the claim in an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday, while criticising what she called the UK government's \"red-carpet treatment\" of the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's three-day visit to the UK. BBC Reality Check contacted her office to ask for her source - her office clarified that she had misspoken and that she had meant the rate of executions had doubled in the past eight months, since July 2017. Mohammed bin Salman was made crown prince in June 2017. Number of executions\nThe Saudi government does not release official statistics on the number of executions it carries out, but state media does report frequently on executions. Ms Thornberry's figures come from Reprieve, a human-rights campaign organisation - its figures come from a compilation of these state media reports, which are publicly available. BBC Reality Check has seen the organisation's database of these reports. Between July 2017 and February 2018, Reprieve says, there were 133 executions in Saudi Arabia (on average 16.6 a month), compared with 67 between October 2016 and May 2017 (on average 8.4 a month). In June 2017, most of which was in the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, the organisation found no reports of executions. Reprieve's figures are broadly in line with those of Human Rights Watch, another campaign group, which has separately compiled Saudi Press Agency reports. Human Rights Watch says there were 138 executions between July 2017 and February 2018, and 68 for the earlier period. Global comparison\nA lack of transparency around execution figures is not uncommon - most of the data for international comparisons comes from human rights organisations such as Reprieve and Amnesty International. In 2016, these two organisations' figures were broadly in agreement. Based on these figures, globally Saudi Arabia ranks third highest in the world, behind China and Iran. Both said that China had executed the most people, although they were unable to provide a figure - the number of executions is a state secret in China, and the groups say they believe that those reported in the media \"are likely to be a fraction of those that are carried out\". Similarly, although Amnesty International puts the number of executions in Iran at more than 567, and Reprieve has the lower figure of more than 534, Reprieve notes that \"the actual number of executions is likely to be higher... given the government's under-reporting of executions and the holding of secret executions\". In a press release, Reprieve pointed out that the doubling of executions had coincided with Mohammed bin Salman's appointment as crown prince, \"in marked contrast to the headline-grabbing reforms that have been introduced in the Kingdom\". Dr Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, from the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University, told the BBC that the number of executions had escalated sharply in 2015. \"My reading is that the higher rate of executions is partly due to a decision by the Saudi authorities to carry out a large number of death sentences that had been imposed but not acted upon during the reign of King Abdullah,\" he said. \"It's hard to pinpoint any one issue over the past eight months which might explain why there has been such a sudden jump,\" he added. A researcher for Human Rights Watch said that the lack of transparency from the Saudi authorities made it \"hard to find a pattern to it all\". Saudi Arabia's record on human rights has come under scrutiny during the crown prince's visit, with the leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, challenging Theresa May on it during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday. The prime minister said she would be raising human rights issues with the crown prince. Reality Check contacted the Saudi Arabian embassy in London for comment but had not received a reply at the time of publication.

        "content": "Paul Pogba has been getting a lot of criticism recently but, if I am ever negative about him, it is only because he is such a wonderfully gifted player that I want to see him do so much more. Although the \u00a389m Manchester United midfielder has not been making or scoring the goals I would expect from him in the past few weeks, that is partly down to the role he has been asked to play and the players who are around him. United manager Jose Mourinho needs balance in his team and he is still trying to find his best XI. Mourinho has got so much attacking talent that sometimes Pogba is asked to play deeper, and he has also had to build a new relationship with Alexis Sanchez since the Chile international joined United from Arsenal in January. Pogba has had to work out what Sanchez is going to do when he cuts inside, and where he fits into that, and learn how to adapt his game and find his own space. All of that has affected the impact the France international has had on matches, not just with his goals and assists, but with his shots and the number of chances he has created. Mourinho dropped Pogba for the first leg of their Champions League tie with Sevilla, but I am not sure what the manager's motivation was with that decision. Pogba is United's best midfielder and he also straight back in the starting XI for their next game. It was a kick up the backside, like many people said, but not just for Pogba. I don't think it was about getting more out of him, because he would have cracked on anyway. Sometimes as a manager you make an example of a player to show the others that everyone has to chip in and do the job they are told, not the job they want to do. I have had managers say to me in the past that, because I was a senior player, they were going to criticise me in a team meeting because, if I could get it, then the other players would have to take it as well. I was just asked to take it nicely on the chin. We don't know why Mourinho put Pogba on the bench in Spain but he might have said to him that he is doing it to send a message to the rest of the team - and that he would be back against Chelsea at the weekend. People have to understand the dynamics of that kind of decision and I don't think we can speculate on the relationship between Mourinho and Pogba on the back of it, because we don't know what has been said behind closed doors. What I would say in response to the stories about Pogba being unhappy with his treatment or that his future at United is in doubt, is that he has not reacted to what happened in a negative way. I judge players by what I see from their body language on the pitch and when Pogba came on against Sevilla after being substituted against Tottenham and then dropped, he was hungry, sharp, put himself about and did not look in any way whatsoever as if he was sulking. Since then, while he did not put in an outstanding individual performance against Chelsea or Crystal Palace, on both occasions he was part of a United side that came from behind to win. It is a compliment to all the United players that they had the desire to do fight back and it does not matter that it was not a perfect performance with Pogba doing lots of silky skills and tricks. Pogba was part of a team that won, which is what Mourinho wants. He does not care if an individual looks good in a game; he just wants all of his players on board trying to fight and win them. So I do not see it as a bad thing that Pogba did not grab hold of those games himself, although that will happen again, I am sure. The reason Pogba gets scrutinised so much is because of how much he cost and because people can see potentially how amazing he can be. That expectation is inevitable with any player who moves for big money but I don't think Pogba has done that badly this season. If you look beyond Manchester City's season of dominance, United are sitting in second place as the best of the rest and that has a lot to do with Pogba. When he is in the team, they look a much better side. Recently, he has been criticised for lacking defensive discipline but I don't think that is a natural part of his game, and you are wasting his ability if you are playing him just as a holding player. Yes, he can still influence games from deep with his passing ability and his strength and his power. But where I want to see Pogba is in a role where he has free rein to go and cause damage and win games for United with his creative ability and his shooting skills. That will come to fruition soon because of how good he is, and because Mourinho will find the right role for him when he knits his attack together. In some ways Pogba is a victim of his own ability. He is so athletic - he can intercept, head the ball, run quickly and tackle. On top of that, he is two-footed, skilful and he can score goals, so he has got everything you need to play in any role in the middle of the pitch, which is obviously a good thing. But I know as a former midfielder myself that it is difficult when you are asked to do different jobs every week in different situations against different opposition. Yes, Pogba should be able to do it all because of his ability, but finding your best level is not a case of clicking your fingers. A good example of that was Pogba's performance in United's 2-0 defeat by Tottenham in January, when he was part of a two-man midfield with Nemanja Matic. Pogba was asked to be patient with his pressing, hold his position and not use up all the energy he has got. That was probably unusual for him, which is why he struggled and vacated the middle too much. He can get away with not playing the position properly against the lesser clubs because his side are dominating possession, but against good opposition, who find your weaknesses, he will get shown up like he did at Wembley. What you should say to Pogba is that you want him to make an impact on the game and he has got the freedom to do that because United have got the personnel around him to fill the holes he leaves. Even playing him as one of two men in the centre of midfield would work if one of United's wide midfielders is ready to tuck in nice and narrow. Juan Mata, for example, is not a winger so he would do that if he was on the right. In my time at Liverpool, Steven Gerrard used to go wandering and I would move across to be alongside Dietmar Hamann. Part of that is common sense by the players themselves, but Hamann was probably the best player I learned from when it came to telling his team-mates where they need to be. When Gerrard and I were roaming forward and playing for ourselves a bit and we were under the cosh, Hamann would say to us, 'Stay there - don't you move. Stay together and let's see this out'. He would just keep on at you. I would be staying close to him and he would be talking me through when to press and when to drop, using the experience he had gained. I passed that on when I was at Fulham and played alongside Jimmy Bullard in midfield. There were games where Jimmy disappeared on me a little bit, but I liked the fact that he was adventurous and tried to get hold of the game and make things happen. He wanted the ball all the time, like Pogba does now. What I used to do sometimes was yell at him and say, 'Listen mate, I need you you - just for 10 minutes. Sit with me and help me out because I am getting run ragged here and we need to stay in the game'. That kind of thing should really be happening all over the pitch with players talking to each other, but I did not see Nemanja Matic doing it with Pogba against Spurs at Wembley. I see Pogba at his best in a three-man midfield, but that does not have to be with two holding players behind him, with him floating further forward. He has the ability to take the ball off the back four and hit a 70-yard pass with either foot - and you do not want to take that away from him. What you can do instead is speak to Matic, Scott McTominay or whoever is alongside Pogba in midfield, and get them all to vary their game. They all need to be fluid in there because you cannot be predictable all the time. The best midfield pairing I came up against was Roy Keane and Paul Scholes at Manchester United, and they mixed it up. Keane would usually drop off and sit in front of the back four but sometimes Scholes would be deeper than him to get on the ball, with Keane pressing ahead of him. It is not one rule for one role for Pogba either - it is different rules for different games depending on who is playing around him, and who United are playing against. There is no need for things to be so rigid that he is not allowed to mix up his game at all, because he should get on the ball where he wants. Danny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan. ",

        "content": "An alleged Sikh extremist whose invitation to an official event with Canada's PM in India last month caused an uproar has apologised for \"any embarrassment this matter has caused\". Justin Trudeau faced criticism after inviting Jaspal Atwal to a reception. The invitation was later withdrawn. Mr Atwal, a Canadian citizen of Indian origin, was convicted of trying to assassinate an Indian minister in 1986. He is accused of having been aligned at the time with a Sikh separatist group. \"I am sorry for any embarrassment this matter has caused to Canada, India, my community and my family,\" Mr Atwal, 62, was quoted as telling reporters by the AFP news agency. \"I renounce any form of terrorism. I do not advocate for an independent Sikh nation. I, like the vast majority of Sikhs who once advocated for this cause, have reconciled with the nation of India.\" His invitation embarrassed the visiting delegation, which had been trying to allay concerns it was too soft on separatists who support a Sikh independence movement, called the \"Khalistan movement\". It seeks to create an independent homeland for the community in the Sikh-dominated northern state of Punjab. The invitation to a dinner hosted by Canada's high commissioner in Delhi was quickly revoked. Mr Trudeau publicly blamed the gaffe on an MP from his party who extended the invite to Mr Atwal. Mr Atwal was convicted along with three others of shooting Indian minister Malkiat Singh Sidhu while he was in Vancouver on a personal visit in 1986. He was paroled in 1992. He said since his parole, he had engaged in politics on behalf of the Indo-Canadian community. He had also visited India numerous times, including three visits over the past year, each time \"with the full permission of the Indian government,\" Mr Atwal added. \"There were also no restrictions placed on me by Canada so that I could not travel,\" he added. Before his latest trip, Mr Atwal said he reached out to his local MP to ask if he could attend a reception with Trudeau in India. \"I had assumed there would be no problems. No one had at any point indicated there would be any issues,\" he said. Canada has a large Sikh community and Mr Trudeau's cabinet includes four Sikh-Canadians. ",

        "content": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump are to meet in person as early as May, it has been announced, an extraordinary overture after months of mutual hostility. News of the meeting was delivered by South Korean officials after talks with Mr Trump at the White House. They passed a verbal message from Mr Kim, saying the North Korean leader was \"committed to denuclearisation\". South Korea's President Moon Jae-in said the news \"came like a miracle\". \"If President Trump and Chairman Kim meet following an inter-Korean summit, complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula will be put on the right track in earnest,\" he said. China has welcomed the development, saying the Korean peninsula issue was \"heading in the right direction\" and calling for \"political courage\". However, correspondents say the North has halted missile and nuclear tests during previous talks, only to resume them when it lost patience or felt it was not getting what it demanded. The latest announcement came days after the South Korean delegation met Mr Kim in Pyongyang. Speaking outside the White House after briefing Mr Trump, South Korean National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong said he had passed on a message that Mr Kim was \"committed to denuclearisation\" and had \"pledged that North Korea will refrain from any further nuclear or missile tests\". Mr Trump said the development was \"great progress\" but that sanctions on North Korea would remain in place until a firm agreement was reached. In a statement sent to the Washington Post, North Korea's UN ambassador said the \"courageous decision\" of Mr Kim would helped secure \"peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and the East Asia region\". There is no indication yet of where the Trump-Kim talks might take place, but the Korean border's demilitarised zone (DMZ) and Beijing are seen as likely options. Moon's huge gamble\nAnalysis by BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul President Moon Jae-in has acknowledged there are obstacles ahead. He is managing expectations and so much can go wrong. His approval ratings took a hit during the Winter Olympics after he integrated the women's hockey team with players from the North and met a general from Pyongyang who had been accused of masterminding deadly attacks on South Koreans, though they have since rebounded. These talks are a huge gamble with a communist state which is hard to read. But if, just if, he helps pull it off, it may reduce the threat of nuclear war and he could win himself a Nobel Peace prize. If all fails, it is back to brinkmanship. Read Laura's piece in full How did we reach this point?\nNorth Korea has been isolated for decades because of its well-documented human rights abuses and its pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws. It has carried out six nuclear tests, and has missiles which could reach the US. It says it needs these to ensure its survival. But South Korea's hosting of the Winter Olympics gave an unexpected window for diplomacy. Rare inter-Korean talks were held to facilitate the North's carefully choreographed attendance. South Korea then held landmark talks with Mr Kim in Pyongyang this week, returning home saying the North was willing to give up its nuclear weapons if it felt it had no reason to keep them. What has North Korea pledged?\nThere were four main elements to the statement delivered by Mr Chung: South Korea statement on Kim-Trump meeting in full The BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says it is important to note that North Korea has not yet promised to abandon its nuclear weapons completely. It also remains unclear exactly what it is asking for in return. One key element could be the tens of thousands of military personnel the US has had in South Korea since the end of the Korean War. The massive annual joint war games infuriate the North, because it believes they are preparation for invasion. They were due to take place during the Olympics but have been suspended for now. Is this a victory for Trump?\nMr Trump has repeatedly belittled Kim Jong-un, and last year threatened him with \"fire and fury\" if North Korea continued to threaten the US. He has at times said there is no point in talking to North Korea. But Mr Chung made a point of saying it was Mr Trump's \"maximum pressure policy\" which had brought the parties to this point, a gesture which the president is likely to appreciate. Our correspondent says Kim Jong-un has also scored a propaganda win, first with the Olympics and now by being seen to reach out to the US. What about the other major players?\nPresident Moon, who is due to meet Mr Kim in April, said the Trump-Kim meeting \"will be recorded as a historic milestone that realised peace on the Korean Peninsula\". The South's statement also credited \"international solidarity\" for the breakthrough, probably in part a reference to the ever-increasing international sanctions on North Korea. China, North Korea's main economic supporter, has in recent months toughened up its dealings with Pyongyang, including on key areas like petroleum and oil. This is thought to be putting a major strain on the North. Beijing has consistently pushed for all parties to talk and on Friday, China's foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said it welcomed the \"positive signals\" from the US and North Korea. \"We're glad that they have finally made this first step... The next key step is for all parties to maintain this momentum,\" Mr Geng said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the development was a \"step in the right direction\". Japan, which saw North Korean missiles fly over its territory twice last year, responded with cautious optimism. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan would \"keep putting maximum pressure until North Korea takes concrete actions toward denuclearisation\", and said he hoped to meet Mr Trump ahead of the Kim summit. Have talks like this happened in the past?\nNo sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader, but there have been repeated attempts to get North Korea to denuclearise. The last major effort - the Six Party talks - collapsed in 2008, largely because North Korea refused to allow inspectors to verify that it had shut down its nuclear programme. A number of bids to restart the talks also collapsed, including in 2012 when North Korea launched another rocket, two weeks after announcing a \"leap day\" (29 February) agreement with the US that had promised food aid in return for inspections and a moratorium on missile tests.

        "content": "Former world number one Serena Williams won her first singles match on the WTA Tour for nearly 14 months as she returned after the birth of her child. The American, 36, reached the second round at Indian Wells with a 7-5 6-3 victory over Kazakhstan's Zarina Diyas. It was her first singles match on the Tour since she won the 2017 Australian Open while pregnant. \"I'm a little rusty but it doesn't matter,\" said the 23-time Grand Slam singles champion. \"It definitely wasn't easy but it was good.\" Williams was given a standing ovation as she walked onto court. Her husband Alexis Ohanian was in the crowd as she set up a second-round match with 29th-seeded Dutch player Kiki Bertens. Williams gave birth to daughter Alexis Olympia on 1 September. She says post-childbirth health complications - including blood clots in her lungs - were almost fatal. Williams missed this year's Australian Open in January because she did not consider herself ready for the tournament. She played an exhibition match in Abu Dhabi in late December and a doubles rubber for the US Fed Cup team against the Netherlands last month. Speaking after her win over Diyas, she said: \"It was incredible. It's been over a year and a kid later. \"I'm just out here on this journey doing the best I can.\" Media playback is not supported on this device BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller Williams did not fluff too many lines on her latest opening night. Given she had not played a competitive singles match for 404 days, this was an impressive return. Diyas showed plenty of resilience, saving five break points - but crucially not a sixth - in the first set, and twice breaking back when Williams hit the front in the second. Williams' serve proved a strong foundation, especially in the first set, and there were some powerful and sweetly struck winners amid some inevitable rust. The best part of 10,000 people were in Stadium Court 1 to watch Williams' return. One was her sister Venus, a potential third-round opponent. Victoria Azarenka - another former world number one - also made a winning return in California, beating British number two Heather Watson 6-4 6-2. Azarenka, a two-time Australian Open champion, was playing for the first time since Wimbledon last year. She withdrew from the 2018 Australian Open because of the ongoing custody battle over her 11-month-old son. The 28-year-old Belarusian encountered few problems on her return as Watson, 25, went out at the first hurdle. ",

The alterative to throwaway cups\nMany of the large coffee shop chains in the UK now offer customers incentives to use reusable cups rather than the throwaway kind. Pret a Manger for example offers a 50p discount while Costa Coffee and Starbucks will knock 25p off. But studies suggest people are more likely to respond to extra charges, for example the plastic bag charge, than they are to discounts. With this in mind, Starbucks is also running a three month trial in some of its central London stores charging those using throwaway cups an extra 5p. Other possible alternatives include making the throwaway cups easier to recycle or creating edible ones.

        "content": "The UK will seek an exemption from President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to the US, according to Trade Secretary Liam Fox. Mr Fox says he will travel to Washington next week when he will discuss the new duties. He said: \"We will, of course, be looking to see how we can maximise the UK's case for exemption under these particular circumstances.\" Steel imports will carry a 25% tariff while aluminium will have a 10% duty. President Trump claims that the US has suffered from \"unfair trade\" and that the tariffs will boost the domestic market. Dr Fox said: \"We understand the anxieties about steel over-production that the United States has but we believe there are other ways to tackle that on a multilateral basis.\" Mr Trump's decision, which comes into effect in two weeks' time, has provoked widespread condemnation from the likes of China and France. It also prompted the resignation of Mr Trump's chief economic adviser Gary Cohn. Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, said: \"Slapping a 25% tax on steel from British companies is going to hit us hard.\" He added: \"It worries me that I don't think the Trump administration has quantified what it can supply from its own market and what it can't. Therefore, it is actually shooting itself in the foot by increasing costs to the US steel sector and US manufacturing sector by 25%.\" Canada and Mexico will be exempt from the tariffs while negotiations continue over the North America Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).

        "content": "Complaints that MPs bullied, harassed and intimidated House of Commons staff have been uncovered in an investigation by BBC Two's Newsnight. Female workers described aggressive and threatening behaviour, saying complaints were not taken seriously. Among those accused of bullying was Speaker John Bercow, whose private secretary left her job in 2011. His spokesman rejects the allegation he behaved in such a manner, \"either eight years ago, or at any other time\". \"Any suggestion to the contrary is simply untrue,\" he said. The House of Commons said it did not tolerate bullying or harassment, however Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson called for a \"thorough, independent investigation\". 'Forcibly kissed and groped'\nNewsnight has been investigating claims of bullying and harassment by MPs of members of the House of Commons Service - a group commonly known in Westminster as \"clerks\". It found that women working in the House said they had been pushed against walls, forcibly kissed, groped and slapped by MPs. They told Newsnight their complaints had not been taken seriously, and that they fear that when complaints are made it is the clerks who are made to move jobs while the MPs are left in place. Since 2014, when the current HR processes were introduced, no complaints raised by staff members have been escalated to formal channels, such as mediation. One of the stories that emerged was that of Kate Emms - who worked as a private secretary to Mr Bercow, starting in mid-2010. Colleagues who spoke to Newsnight claimed that Mr Bercow, who is also the MP for Buckingham, had shouted at her and undermined her in front of other staff. This left her unable to continue working in what was a key Commons post, they said. She was signed off sick in early 2011 and then returned to a new post elsewhere in Parliament. Commons authorities were told that she had been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Two other MPs named in the investigation were Labour's Paul Farrelly and Conservative Mark Pritchard. Witnesses told Newsnight that Mr Farrelly's continued criticism over several years of Emily Commander, a clerk on two committees that the MP sat on, made her job impossible. One witness recalled his behaviour on a science committee trip to Italy in 2004, saying: \"He was a complete and utter bully. \"He wound her up like a screw and reduced her to tears. The more he upset her, the more he enjoyed it, the more he kept turning the screw. He was very aggressive. It felt like no one had the ability or authority to intervene. Everybody knew it was wrong.\" The two crossed paths again when Mr Farrelly was on the culture, media and sport committee in 2010. Documents obtained by Newsnight show she complained then of a campaign of continual belittling and undermining and that she told her bosses that she had \"repeated nightmares about going on Committee visits with Mr Farrelly and being criticised by him for having neglected tiny details\". Newsnight also spoke to several clerks about Mr Pritchard, MP for the Wrekin, who say he was notorious for shouting at and berating clerks. One witness told how he \"exploded\" at a female staff member ahead of a trip to California because he was unhappy with the choice of hotel he had been booked into. He then angrily swore at the same woman on the trip itself. Mr Farrelly and Mr Pritchard have denied all allegations against them. Mr Farrelly told Newsnight: \"In 2012 allegations were made about me having bullied a clerk to the committee during the compilation of the phone-hacking report. These allegations were investigated and not upheld.\" \"Despite this, I apologised if I had inadvertently upset the clerk who had suffered stress. The policy under which they were investigated was considered to be so unfair to those complained about that it was immediately withdrawn and replaced by another policy.\" Mr Pritchard said: \"I understand, over the past several years the House authorities have addressed numerous complaints about MPs, but they have also informed me they have no record of any complaints against me, and if they had, I would have been notified.\" Writing on Twitter, Labour MP Jess Phillips, said Commons staff had told her of similar experiences and the claims \"must be investigated, independently and fairly\". I met with clerks and house staff today and talked to them about they way they get treated, this was reflected in tonights piece. This must be investigated, independently and fairly. https://t.co/88WrJrGBSK End of Twitter post by @jessphillips Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson also called for the allegations to be thoroughly investigated. She told Newsnight the claims raised \"very significant questions\" about the Respect policy, which was designed to prevent bullying and harassment by MPs and their staff. Ms Swinson, a member of the cross-party working group on an independent complaints and grievance policy, said the suggestion was Parliament \"doesn't have modern and professional standards... [and] many MPs see themselves as above other members of staff\". The House of Commons said in a statement: \"The House of Commons takes pride in being a responsible and supportive employer, and does not tolerate bullying or harassment of any kind.\" It added the House had introduced the revised Respect policy in 2014, which aimed to combat bullying and harassment by MPs or their staff. The House said several measures had been put in place alongside the policy including training managers on how to address reports of bullying or harassment and a team of trained contacts for staff to approach if they have concerns.

        "content": "Restaurant chains Wagamama and TGI Fridays have each been fined an undisclosed amount for failing to pay staff the National Minimum Wage. They were among 43 employers in the hospitality sector on the government's latest list of firms breaking the law. Wagamama has repaid an average of \u00a350 to 2,630 employees. TGI Friday's had to repay \u00a325 each to 2,300 staff. Wagamama blamed \"an inadvertent misunderstanding\" of the rules on staff uniforms for the blunder. The company said it had asked front-of-house staff to wear black jeans or a black skirt with their Wagamama-branded top. This was considered as asking them to buy a form of uniform, \"and so we should have paid them for it,\" it said. \"We have gladly made payments to current and previous employees who missed out dating back from 2016 to 2013. We have also updated our uniform policy and we now pay a uniform supplement to cover the black jeans.\" Just before Christmas, Wagamama had to apologise after a note was seen in one of its London restaurants, apparently banning staff from taking sick days. A TGI Fridays statement said the firm had reimbursed team members for a shoe allowance. The firm added: \"This is a historic payment which was paid last year, and we have since reimbursed team members for the purchase of their black uniform shoes.\" In total, 179 employers were fined \u00a31.3m by the government for underpaying their staff. And they were warned that minimum pay rates will increase again on 1 April. The hotel chain Marriott was also fined. It underpaid 279 of its staff over \u00a3250 each on average. The company apologised and said it was committed to paying the National Minimum Wage. \"When an error was identified by a routine HMRC audit in 2015, we co-operated fully with HMRC and promptly reimbursed all those affected,\" it said. Other companies fined included the fashion chain Karen Millen, Birmingham and Stoke City Football Clubs, and St Helens Rugby Club. In its response to the Matthew Taylor Review of the gig economy, called Good Work, the government has already announced plans to give all workers the right to a payslip. It said that would make it easier for 300,000 workers to check that they were being paid the legal minimum. Later this month, the government will launch an awareness campaign for the new minimum wage rates. Employers can be fined up to twice the total wage shortfall, subject to a maximum of \u00a320,000 per worker. ",

        "content": "Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger likened his team to a boxer struggling to get up after a knockdown as they overcame their recent poor form to win 2-0 at AC Milan in the Europa League. The Gunners' last-16 first-leg victory in the San Siro meant they avoided a run of five straight defeats, which they last experienced in 1977. Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Aaron Ramsey scored the goals. \"It is an important win because we had a nightmare week,\" said Wenger. The Gunners fell to a limp Premier League defeat at Brighton on Sunday, following back-to-back 3-0 losses against Manchester City - the first of which came in the League Cup final at Wembley. They also lost 2-1 at home to Swedish minnows Ostersunds FK, surviving a second-leg scare to set up the tie against Milan. Fans have continued to turn against Wenger, with 88% of the Arsenal Supporters' Trust's 1,000 members voting this week in favour of the 68-year-old Frenchman's contract being terminated at the end of the season. It meant Arsenal arrived at the San Siro at arguably the lowest point of Wenger's 22-year reign, but produced an improved performance to inflict a first defeat in 13 games on the Italians. \"When you have big disappointments you forget quickly that you have some qualities. In one week, you do not become a bad team or a bad player. Nothing is permanent in life,\" said Wenger. \"When you are knocked down it's a little bit like in a boxing match when you're half-knocked down you don't have time to recover and the next one comes again. That's what happened to us. \"But at some stage you know you have to respond. Your pride and desire to show quality has to come through in the game.\" Gunners legend Ian Wright accused Wenger's side of lacking \"fight and determination\" in their Carabao Cup final defeat by City, a suggestion dismissed by the Arsenal manager after the victory in the San Siro. \"People forget that to get to a cup final in England, you need mental resources and you need mental qualities,\" said Wenger. \"We lost against a team who are dominating English football at the moment. We have to accept that, it doesn't mean that the team has no spirit.\" ",

        "content": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump are to meet in person by May, it has been announced, an extraordinary overture after months of mutual hostility. News of the meeting was delivered by South Korean officials after talks with Mr Trump at the White House. They passed a verbal message from Mr Kim, saying the North Korean leader was \"committed to denuclearisation\". Mr Trump hailed \"great progress\" but said sanctions would remain in place. South Korea's President Moon Jae-in said the news \"came like a miracle\". \"If President Trump and Chairman Kim meet following an inter-Korean summit, complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula will be put on the right track in earnest,\" he said. China has welcomed the development, saying the Korean peninsula issue was \"heading in the right direction\" and calling for \"political courage\". However, correspondents say the North has halted missile and nuclear tests during previous talks, only to resume them when it lost patience or felt it was not getting what it demanded. The latest announcement came days after the South Korean delegation met Mr Kim in Pyongyang. Speaking outside the White House after briefing Mr Trump, South Korean National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong said he had passed on a message that Mr Kim was \"committed to denuclearisation\" and had \"pledged that North Korea will refrain from any further nuclear or missile tests\". In a statement sent to the Washington Post, North Korea's UN ambassador said the \"courageous decision\" of Mr Kim would help secure \"peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and the East Asia region\". There is no indication yet of where the Trump-Kim talks might take place, but the Korean border's demilitarised zone (DMZ) and Beijing are seen as likely options. Moon's huge gamble\nAnalysis by BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul President Moon Jae-in has acknowledged there are obstacles ahead. He is managing expectations and so much can go wrong. His approval ratings took a hit during the Winter Olympics after he integrated the women's hockey team with players from the North and met a general from Pyongyang who had been accused of masterminding deadly attacks on South Koreans, though they have since rebounded. These talks are a huge gamble with a communist state which is hard to read. But if, just if, he helps pull it off, it may reduce the threat of nuclear war and he could win himself a Nobel Peace prize. If all fails, it is back to brinkmanship. Read Laura's piece in full How did we reach this point?\nNorth Korea has been isolated for decades because of its well-documented human rights abuses and its pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws. Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze. Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being planned! End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump It has carried out six nuclear tests, and has missiles which could reach the US. It says it needs these to ensure its survival. But South Korea's hosting of the Winter Olympics gave an unexpected window for diplomacy. Rare inter-Korean talks were held to facilitate the North's carefully choreographed attendance. South Korea then held landmark talks with Mr Kim in Pyongyang this week, returning home saying the North was willing to give up its nuclear weapons if it felt it had no reason to keep them. What has North Korea pledged?\nThere were four main elements to the statement delivered by Mr Chung: South Korea statement on Kim-Trump meeting in full The BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says it is important to note that North Korea has not yet promised to abandon its nuclear weapons completely. It also remains unclear exactly what it is asking for in return. Is this a victory for Trump?\nMr Trump has repeatedly belittled Kim Jong-un, and last year threatened him with \"fire and fury\" if North Korea continued to threaten the US. He has at times said there is no point in talking to North Korea. But Mr Chung made a point of saying it was Mr Trump's \"maximum pressure policy\" which had brought the parties to this point, a gesture which the president is likely to appreciate. Our correspondent says Kim Jong-un has also scored a propaganda win, first with the Olympics and now by being seen to reach out to the US. Former British ambassador to North Korea, John Everard, told the BBC there must be a suspicion that Mr Kim might be trying to play Mr Trump, to try to \"get him to say across the table things that North Korea has been asking for for a long time\". These could include a peace treaty to finally end the Korean War and a promise that if North Korea denuclearised then the US would finally withdraw its troops from South Korea. The US has tens of thousands of military personnel there and the massive annual joint war games infuriate the North, because it believes they are preparation for invasion. What about the other major players?\nPresident Moon, who is due to meet Mr Kim in April, said the Trump-Kim meeting \"will be recorded as a historic milestone that realised peace on the Korean peninsula\". The South's statement also credited \"international solidarity\" for the breakthrough, probably in part a reference to the ever-increasing international sanctions on North Korea. China, North Korea's main economic supporter, has in recent months toughened up its dealings with Pyongyang, including on key areas like petroleum and oil. This is thought to be putting a major strain on the North. Beijing has consistently pushed for all parties to talk and on Friday, China's foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said it welcomed the \"positive signals\" from the US and North Korea. \"We're glad that they have finally made this first step... The next key step is for all parties to maintain this momentum,\" Mr Geng said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the development was a \"step in the right direction\". \"It should not just be a meeting, it should open up a way to resuming a fully fledged diplomatic process to find a solution to the North Korean nuclear issue,\" he said. Japan, which saw North Korean missiles fly over its territory twice last year, responded with cautious optimism. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan would \"keep putting maximum pressure until North Korea takes concrete actions toward denuclearisation\", and said he hoped to meet Mr Trump ahead of the Kim summit. Have talks like this happened in the past?\nNo sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader, but there have been repeated attempts to get North Korea to denuclearise. The last major effort - the Six Party talks - collapsed in 2008, largely because North Korea refused to allow inspectors to verify that it had shut down its nuclear programme. A number of bids to restart the talks also collapsed, including in 2012 when North Korea launched another rocket, two weeks after announcing a \"leap day\" (29 February) agreement with the US that had promised food aid in return for inspections and a moratorium on missile tests.

        "content": "Fast-food chain KFC has returned to its old distributor after suffering chicken shortages that forced the temporary closure of hundreds of outlets. Last month, the chain experienced widespread distribution problems after it decided to switch its logistics contract from Bidvest to DHL. But now Bidvest has signed a new agreement with KFC UK & Ireland to supply up to 350 of its 900 restaurants. Bidvest pledged \"a seamless return\". Until 13 February, all KFC's chicken was delivered by Bidvest. But after the contract switched to DHL, which uses software developed by the firm Quick Service Logistics (QSL), many of the food giant's outlets began running out of chicken products. At the time, DHL blamed \"operational issues\" at a warehouse near Rugby it was using for deliveries nationwide. 'Limited' menus\n\"Our focus remains on ensuring our customers can enjoy our chicken without further disruption,\" said a KFC spokesperson. \"With that in mind, the decision has been taken in conjunction with QSL and DHL to revert the distribution contract for up to 350 of our restaurants in the north of the UK back to Bidvest Logistics. \"We've been working hard to resolve the present situation with QSL and DHL. This decision will ease pressure at DHL's Rugby depot, to help get our restaurants back to normal as quickly as possible.\" KFC said more than 97% of its restaurants were now open for business, but there would be \"some limited menus\" before full service was resumed. Paul Whyte of Bidvest said the firm was \"delighted\" to resume its partnership with KFC. He added: \"KFC are a valued customer and we will provide them with a seamless return to our network.\" ",

        "content": "A proposal to impose a so-called latte levy on throwaway coffee cups has been questioned by the government. MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee had suggested a charge of 25p for disposable coffee cups to reduce their use. But ministers say it is better for shops to offer voluntary discounts to customers bringing their own cups. MPs says the government's response suggests it is not serious about its promise to tackle plastic litter. Committee chairwoman Mary Creagh said: \"The UK's throwaway culture is having a devastating impact on our streets, beaches and seas. Our report recommended practical solutions to the disposable packaging crisis. \"The government's response shows that despite warm words they plan no real action.\" She said evidence to the committee showed charges work better than discounts for reducing the use of non-recyclable materials - as was the case with the plastic bag charge. \"By choosing to favour voluntary discounts, the government is ignoring the evidence about what works,\" she said. The government said it was serious about the issue - but did not want to jump to hasty conclusions. Its response to the committee, it said: \"Coffee cups make up 0.7% of total paper packaging waste in the UK. We believe it is important to look at the packaging and waste management system as a whole.\" It said ministers had heard little evidence that recyclable cups would meet industry standards prohibiting coffee-covered containers from contaminating the recycling stream. More research is needed, ministers said. But the government did signal an intent to reform what's known as the \"producer responsibility\" system in which packaging firms chip in towards the cost of recycling technology. A report this week from the waste consultancy Eunomia said the industry was exaggerating the waste it recycles and paying far too little towards the \u00a32.8bn cost to households of collecting and dealing with waste. The alterative to throwaway cups\nMany of the large coffee shop chains in the UK now offer customers incentives to use reusable cups rather than the throwaway kind. Pret a Manger for example offers a 50p discount while Costa Coffee and Starbucks will knock 25p off. But studies suggest people are more likely to respond to extra charges, for example the plastic bag charge, than they are to discounts. With this in mind, Starbucks is also running a three month trial in some of its central London stores charging those using throwaway cups an extra 5p. Other possible alternatives include making the throwaway cups easier to recycle or creating edible ones. The National Audit Office is launching a review of the government's oversight of the system, following a request from the Environmental Audit Committee, which has concerns that it is opaque, and could be subject to fraud and non-compliance.

        "content": "An Australian couple have been united with a \"fairytale\" photo of their engagement, after a tourist found the pair via social media. US photographer Rob Lau captured Philo Botros' marriage proposal to Monica Gaid on Sydney Harbour last month. The picture came to their notice after it was shared online by Mr Lau's friend. Ms Gaid said discovering the picture-perfect shot was a \"surreal\" experience. \"I had no idea this photo even existed, until my friend saw it on Facebook. It was just not expected in any way, and now we have this amazing, literally one-of-a-kind photo,\" she told the BBC. Mr Lau said he had been in Sydney for a short work trip that day and had wondered over to the scenic spot at Mrs Macquaries Chair for some last-minute sight-seeing. \"As a hobbyist photographer whenever I travel I try to get a couple of sunset shots in,\" he said. He was about to leave when a noise from the water's edge caught his attention. \"At that moment I saw a guy get down on his knees getting ready to propose, and I quickly pivoted my tripod and snapped a few shots,\" he said. He captured the pair's silhouettes against a backdrop of the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge in a wide panorama. Ms Gaid said the noise that alerted Mr Lau had been the sound of her designated photographer tripping and falling into the water. As such, she thought they had missed out on photos of the moment. After Mr Lau returned home to California, his friend shared the picture on Reddit and speculated that he could find the couple. Ms Gaid got in touch within two days.

        "content": "Former world number one Serena Williams won her first singles match on the WTA Tour for nearly 14 months as she returned after the birth of her child. The American, 36, reached the second round at Indian Wells with a 7-5 6-3 victory over Kazakhstan's Zarina Diyas. It was her first singles match on the Tour since she won the 2017 Australian Open while pregnant. \"I'm a little rusty but it doesn't matter,\" said the 23-time Grand Slam singles champion. \"It definitely wasn't easy but it was good.\" Williams was given a standing ovation as she walked onto court. Her husband Alexis Ohanian was in the crowd as she set up a second-round match with 29th-seeded Dutch player Kiki Bertens. Williams gave birth to daughter Alexis Olympia on 1 September. She says post-childbirth health complications - including blood clots in her lungs - were almost fatal. Williams missed this year's Australian Open in January because she did not consider herself ready for the tournament. She played an exhibition match in Abu Dhabi in late December and a doubles rubber for the US Fed Cup team against the Netherlands last month. Speaking after her win over Diyas, she said: \"It was incredible. It's been over a year and a kid later. \"I'm just out here on this journey doing the best I can.\" Media playback is not supported on this device BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller Williams did not fluff too many lines on her latest opening night. Given she had not played a competitive singles match for 404 days, this was an impressive return. Diyas showed plenty of resilience, saving five break points - but crucially not a sixth - in the first set, and twice breaking back when Williams hit the front in the second. Williams' serve proved a strong foundation, especially in the first set, and there were some powerful and sweetly struck winners amid some inevitable rust. The best part of 10,000 people were in Stadium Court 1 to watch Williams' return. One was her sister Venus, a potential third-round opponent. Victoria Azarenka - another former world number one - also made a winning return in California, beating British number two Heather Watson 6-4 6-2. Azarenka, a two-time Australian Open champion, was playing for the first time since Wimbledon last year. She withdrew from the 2018 Australian Open because of the ongoing custody battle over her 11-month-old son. The 28-year-old Belarusian encountered few problems on her return against Watson, 25, and said after the match that she only knew she would be able to play in Indian Wells a week ago. Asked how the last few months had been, Azarenka added: \"They weren't fun. \"I wouldn't wish that on anybody to go through what I've been going through, but it's part of life and there are blessings in this situation as well for me. \"I'm free but it's definitely been and still is a really difficult situation to be in and it's hard to only focus on playing tennis. \"One day I'll write a book about this, because it's Hollywood-worthy for sure. But right now I just want to keep it a little bit private.\" Azarenka said she would also compete at the Miami Open starting on 19 March. ",

        "content": "Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger likened his team to a boxer struggling to get up after a knockdown as they overcame their recent poor form to win 2-0 at AC Milan in the Europa League. The Gunners' last-16 first-leg victory in the San Siro meant they avoided a run of five straight defeats, which they last experienced in 1977. Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Aaron Ramsey scored the goals. \"It is an important win because we had a nightmare week,\" said Wenger. The Gunners fell to a limp Premier League defeat at Brighton on Sunday, following back-to-back 3-0 losses against Manchester City - the first of which came in the League Cup final at Wembley. They also lost 2-1 at home to Swedish minnows Ostersunds FK, surviving a second-leg scare to set up the tie against Milan. Fans have continued to turn against Wenger, with 88% of the Arsenal Supporters' Trust's 1,000 members voting this week in favour of the 68-year-old Frenchman's contract being terminated at the end of the season. It meant Arsenal arrived at the San Siro at arguably the lowest point of Wenger's 22-year reign, but produced an improved performance to inflict a first defeat in 13 games on the Italians. \"When you have big disappointments you forget quickly that you have some qualities. In one week, you do not become a bad team or a bad player. Nothing is permanent in life,\" said Wenger. \"When you are knocked down it's a little bit like in a boxing match when you're half-knocked down you don't have time to recover and the next one comes again. That's what happened to us. \"But at some stage you know you have to respond. Your pride and desire to show quality has to come through in the game.\" Gunners legend Ian Wright accused Wenger's side of lacking \"fight and determination\" in their Carabao Cup final defeat by City, a suggestion dismissed by the Arsenal manager after the victory in the San Siro. \"People forget that to get to a cup final in England, you need mental resources and you need mental qualities,\" said Wenger. \"We lost against a team who are dominating English football at the moment. We have to accept that, it doesn't mean that the team has no spirit.\" ",

        "content": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump are to meet in person by May, it has been announced, an extraordinary overture after months of mutual hostility. News of the meeting was delivered by South Korean officials after talks with Mr Trump at the White House. They passed a verbal message from Mr Kim, saying the North Korean leader was \"committed to denuclearisation\". Mr Trump hailed \"great progress\" but said sanctions would remain in place. South Korea's President Moon Jae-in said the news \"came like a miracle\". \"If President Trump and Chairman Kim meet following an inter-Korean summit, complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula will be put on the right track in earnest,\" he said. China has welcomed the development, saying the Korean peninsula issue was \"heading in the right direction\" and calling for \"political courage\". However, correspondents say the North has halted missile and nuclear tests during previous talks, only to resume them when it lost patience or felt it was not getting what it demanded. The latest announcement came days after the South Korean delegation met Mr Kim in Pyongyang. Speaking outside the White House after briefing Mr Trump, South Korean National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong said he had passed on a message that Mr Kim was \"committed to denuclearisation\" and had \"pledged that North Korea will refrain from any further nuclear or missile tests\". In a statement sent to the Washington Post, North Korea's UN ambassador said the \"courageous decision\" of Mr Kim would help secure \"peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and the East Asia region\". There is no indication yet of where the Trump-Kim talks might take place, but the Korean border's demilitarised zone (DMZ) and Beijing are seen as likely options. Moon's huge gamble\nAnalysis by BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul President Moon Jae-in has acknowledged there are obstacles ahead. He is managing expectations and so much can go wrong. His approval ratings took a hit during the Winter Olympics after he integrated the women's hockey team with players from the North and met a general from Pyongyang who had been accused of masterminding deadly attacks on South Koreans, though they have since rebounded. These talks are a huge gamble with a communist state which is hard to read. But if, just if, he helps pull it off, it may reduce the threat of nuclear war and he could win himself a Nobel Peace prize. If all fails, it is back to brinkmanship. Read Laura's piece in full How did we reach this point?\nNorth Korea has been isolated for decades because of its well-documented human rights abuses and its pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws. Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze. Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being planned! End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump It has carried out six nuclear tests, and has missiles which could reach the US. It says it needs these to ensure its survival. But South Korea's hosting of the Winter Olympics gave an unexpected window for diplomacy. Rare inter-Korean talks were held to facilitate the North's carefully choreographed attendance. South Korea then held landmark talks with Mr Kim in Pyongyang this week, returning home saying the North was willing to give up its nuclear weapons if it felt it had no reason to keep them. What has North Korea pledged?\nThere were four main elements to the statement delivered by Mr Chung: South Korea statement on Kim-Trump meeting in full The BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says it is important to note that North Korea has not yet promised to abandon its nuclear weapons completely. It also remains unclear exactly what it is asking for in return. Is this a victory for Trump?\nMr Trump has repeatedly belittled Kim Jong-un, and last year threatened him with \"fire and fury\" if North Korea continued to threaten the US. He has at times said there is no point in talking to North Korea. But Mr Chung made a point of saying it was Mr Trump's \"maximum pressure policy\" which had brought the parties to this point, a gesture which the president is likely to appreciate. Our correspondent says Kim Jong-un has also scored a propaganda win, first with the Olympics and now by being seen to reach out to the US. Former British ambassador to North Korea, John Everard, told the BBC there must be a suspicion that Mr Kim might be trying to play Mr Trump, to try to \"get him to say across the table things that North Korea has been asking for for a long time\". These could include a peace treaty to finally end the Korean War and a promise that if North Korea denuclearised then the US would finally withdraw its troops from South Korea. The US has tens of thousands of military personnel there and the massive annual joint war games infuriate the North, because it believes they are preparation for invasion. What about the other major players?\nPresident Moon, who is due to meet Mr Kim in April, said the Trump-Kim meeting \"will be recorded as a historic milestone that realised peace on the Korean peninsula\". The South's statement also credited \"international solidarity\" for the breakthrough, probably in part a reference to the ever-increasing international sanctions on North Korea. China, North Korea's main economic supporter, has in recent months toughened up its dealings with Pyongyang, including on key areas like petroleum and oil. This is thought to be putting a major strain on the North. Beijing has consistently pushed for all parties to talk and on Friday, China's foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said it welcomed the \"positive signals\" from the US and North Korea. \"We're glad that they have finally made this first step... The next key step is for all parties to maintain this momentum,\" Mr Geng said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the development was a \"step in the right direction\". \"It should not just be a meeting, it should open up a way to resuming a fully fledged diplomatic process to find a solution to the North Korean nuclear issue,\" he said. Japan, which saw North Korean missiles fly over its territory twice last year, responded with cautious optimism. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan would \"keep putting maximum pressure until North Korea takes concrete actions toward denuclearisation\", and said he hoped to meet Mr Trump ahead of the Kim summit. Have talks like this happened in the past?\nNo sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader, but there have been repeated attempts to get North Korea to denuclearise. The last major effort - the Six Party talks - collapsed in 2008, largely because North Korea refused to allow inspectors to verify that it had shut down its nuclear programme. A number of bids to restart the talks also collapsed, including in 2012 when North Korea launched another rocket, two weeks after announcing a \"leap day\" (29 February) agreement with the US that had promised food aid in return for inspections and a moratorium on missile tests.

        "content": "India's Supreme Court has allowed people to draw up \"living wills\", meaning they can seek what is known as passive euthanasia. It means medical treatment can be withdrawn to hasten a person's death, if strict guidelines are followed. This would apply to patients suffering from terminal illness and who are in a vegetative state. A living will sets out a patient's wishes regarding how they want to be treated if they are seriously ill. The Indian judges said the right to die with dignity was a fundamental right and that an advance directive by a person in the form of a living will could be approved by the courts. Petitioners, who had argued that people have the right to die with dignity if they are suffering from a terminal illness, hailed the judgment. \"Today's is landmark judgement because it comes at a time when medical science allows patients to kept alive by artificial means and the hospitals to keep charging money,\" Vipul Mudgal, the head of main petitioner Common Cause, an advocacy group, told the BBC. Passive euthanasia\nWhen a patient dies because medical professionals either do not do something necessary to keep the patient alive, or stop doing something that is keeping the patient alive. This might include: It remains unclear, however, how courts could guarantee that living wills were not drafted by patients under coercion. In 2011, India's top court had ruled that life support could be removed for terminally ill patients in exceptional circumstances. While rejecting a plea to end the life of a woman who had been in a vegetative state since 1973 in the city of Mumbai after being raped and strangled, the court had said some cases of euthanasia could be sanctioned if doctors were to file a case in court. Aruna Shanbaug, who was left with severe brain damage and paralysed after the 1973 attack by a ward attendant in the Mumbai hospital where she worked, died in 2015. Her death sparked a national debate over euthanasia. The 2011 judgement had put the onus on doctors to petition to withdraw life support, under the supervision of the courts. Previously all forms of euthanasia were illegal in India. On Friday, judges of India's Supreme Court outlined detailed \"guidelines\" for facilitating passive euthanasia. The court said that family members and relatives of terminally ill patients seeking passive euthanasia could go to court to have it sanctioned. A team of doctors would then be appointed by the court to decide if it is needed. There have been a number of requests for active euthanasia - any act that intentionally helps another person kill themselves - by Indians which have been rejected by courts and authorities. In 2008, Jeet Narayan, a resident of Uttar Pradesh state, wrote to the then Indian president Pratibha Patil seeking permission to end the lives of his four bed-ridden, paralysed children. The president had rejected the plea. In 2013, Dennis Kumar, a porter from Tamil Nadu, sought permission from the authorities to end the life of his infant son, who had been suffering from a congenital disorder. The plea was rejected by a court. ",

Sergey Lavrov said Russia has not yet been approached by UK authorities investigating the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. The pair are critically ill after being exposed to a nerve agent in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon. Home Secretary Amber Rudd is visiting the city, where cordons are in place. Counter-terrorism police remain at Mr Skripal's house and parts of the Wiltshire city remain sealed off after the incident. On Thursday afternoon there was a \"flurry of activity\" in Salisbury as investigators wearing protective suits went into Mr Skripal's house, as they try to ascertain where the pair were exposed to the nerve agent. It is known that Mr Skripal and his daughter had visited the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found collapsed on a bench near the Maltings shopping centre. Police said 21 people had been seen for medical treatment in the aftermath of the incident, but only three people were being treated. Det Sgt Nick Bailey - who attended the scene on Sunday - is stable and conscious but is \"very anxious\" about being exposed to a nerve agent. Former Russian military security colonel Mr Skripal, 66, was convicted by the Russian government of passing secrets to MI6, but given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a \"spy swap\".

        "content": "A proposal to impose a so-called latte levy on throwaway coffee cups has been questioned by the government. MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee had suggested a charge of 25p for disposable coffee cups to reduce their use. But ministers say it is better for shops to offer voluntary discounts to customers bringing their own cups. MPs says the government's response suggests it is not serious about its promise to tackle plastic litter. Committee chairwoman Mary Creagh said: \"The UK's throwaway culture is having a devastating impact on our streets, beaches and seas. Our report recommended practical solutions to the disposable packaging crisis. \"The government's response shows that despite warm words they plan no real action.\" She said evidence to the committee showed charges work better than discounts for reducing the use of non-recyclable materials - as was the case with the plastic bag charge. \"By choosing to favour voluntary discounts, the government is ignoring the evidence about what works,\" she said. The government said it was serious about the issue - but did not want to jump to hasty conclusions. Its response to the committee, it said: \"Coffee cups make up 0.7% of total paper packaging waste in the UK. We believe it is important to look at the packaging and waste management system as a whole.\" It said ministers had heard little evidence that recyclable cups would meet industry standards prohibiting coffee-covered containers from contaminating the recycling stream. More research is needed, ministers said. But the government did signal an intent to reform what's known as the \"producer responsibility\" system in which packaging firms chip in towards the cost of recycling technology. A report this week from the waste consultancy Eunomia said the industry was exaggerating the waste it recycles and paying far too little towards the \u00a32.8bn cost to households of collecting and dealing with waste. The alterative to throwaway cups\nMany of the large coffee shop chains in the UK now offer customers incentives to use reusable cups rather than the throwaway kind. Pret a Manger for example offers a 50p discount while Costa Coffee and Starbucks will knock 25p off. But studies suggest people are more likely to respond to extra charges, for example the plastic bag charge, than they are to discounts. With this in mind, Starbucks is also running a three month trial in some of its central London stores charging those using throwaway cups an extra 5p. Other possible alternatives include making the throwaway cups easier to recycle or creating edible ones. The National Audit Office is launching a review of the government's oversight of the system, following a request from the Environmental Audit Committee, which has concerns that it is opaque, and could be subject to fraud and non-compliance. The government said the idea of a latte tax would be considered as part of a call for evidence on single-use plastics. That initiative was promised by the chancellor in the autumn budget but it hasn't happened yet. Follow Roger on Twitter. ",

Meanwhile Japan's Nikkei 225 index - which initially rose by 2.5% - closed only 0.5% higher. A sigh of relief is no surprise\nAnalysis by Karishma Vaswani, Asia Business Correspondent Investors in the region have been watching the potential conflict between the US and North Korea for months now. And news that the two could meet by May of this year is being greeted with a sigh of relief by many. And that shouldn't come as a surprise. Nobody wants a conflict on the Korean peninsula to break out, especially between arguably two of the world's most volatile leaders. East Asian economies would be almost certainly be hit, because of integrated supply chains in the region. It's a region central to global shipping and manufacturing, so any escalation of the current tensions could disrupt trade and economic activity. But perhaps what's more interesting, is what a potential meeting between \"Rocket Man\" and the \"Dotard\" says about just how badly the North Korean economy may be doing as sanctions bite. Read more from Karishma: Did sanctions push N Korea into US talks? Hong Kong's Hang Seng ended 1.1% higher, while China's mainland indexes also made small gains. The South Korean won climbed slightly, while the Japanese yen slipped against the US dollar. That is not unexpected given the yen is a safe haven currency, with investors tending to seek out riskier assets with better returns when things appear more stable. ",

Food and medical supplies have arrived in the town of Douma, the International Committee for the Red Cross said. It follows a pause in Syrian government air strikes overnight, with the situation in the besieged enclave on Friday described as \"calm\". A previous delivery of aid to the region was cut short amid shelling. Friday's delivery is the third attempt this week to get humanitarian aid into the region. On Monday, a convoy of 46 trucks delivered some provisions to Douma but was forced to turn back. A second attempt was later made to deliver the aid that agencies had failed to offload, but this was cancelled at the last minute due to security concerns.

        "content": "Former US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle are in talks to produce shows for Netflix, according to the New York Times. The couple would make exclusive content for the US streaming site focused on uplifting stories, the paper suggested. If confirmed, the deal would give a global platform for the Obamas, bypassing mainstream US media such as Fox News. Netflix told the BBC it had no comment to make about the reports. 'Inspire'\nEric Schultz, a senior adviser to the former president, did not confirm the plans but said they would make sense. \"President and Mrs Obama have always believed in the power of storytelling to inspire,\" he told the paper. \"Throughout their lives, they have lifted up stories of people whose efforts to make a difference are quietly changing the world for the better. As they consider their future personal plans, they continue to explore new ways to help others tell and share their stories.\" The New York Times said one possible show idea was for Mr Obama to moderate debates on issues such as health care, climate change and immigration- all of which dominated his eight years in the White House. But the paper said there were no plans to use the shows to attack conservative critics or Donald Trump. The streaming service's mix of original drama, films and other programming has proved popular globally, with subscriber numbers reaching nearly 118 million at the end of 2017. And it has been investing heavily in content as it tries to grow that subscriber base - with hit shows such as Stranger Things and Black Mirror as well as films and documentaries. It is unclear how much the Obamas will be paid if a deal is struck. Mr Obama already connects directly to an audience through social media. He has has more than 100 million twitter followers and his Facebook page has been liked by 55 million users. ",

        "content": "Major trading partners of the US have condemned President Donald Trump for signing off new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. China described it as a \"serious attack\" on the system of international trade. French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire said there were \"only losers\" in a trade war. Mr Trump says the US has suffered from \"unfair trade\" and that the tariffs will boost US industry. The import duties - 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium - will go into effect in 15 days, although Canada and Mexico will be exempt while negotiations continue over the North America Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Mr Trump signed the declaration in a White House ceremony attended by American workers from both industries. What has the international reaction been?\nChina's steel and metals associations demanded retaliation, urging the government to target US imports including coal, agricultural products and electronics. Japan said the import duties would have a \"big impact\" on bilateral ties, while South Korea threatened to take the issue to the World Trade Organization. Canada, the largest supplier of steel and aluminium to the US, welcomed its exemption but said it would continue to press Washington to drop the tariffs. Mexico's Economy Minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, insisted the tariffs could not be linked to talks on Nafta. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem tweeted that, as a close ally of the US, the bloc should be excluded from the tariffs. The UK government said it would work with EU partners to consider \"the scope for exemptions\" while \"robustly\" supporting UK industries. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the US could have \"no complaints\" about their bilateral trading relationship and his government would be \"relentless\" in pursuing an exemption from the tariffs. What about inside the US?\nThere was strong opposition from within Mr Trump's own Republican Party, which is traditionally in favour of free trade. US House Speaker Paul Ryan denounced the new measures and said he feared \"unintended consequences\". Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said he believed the president had been \"misled\" by those advising him at the White House. Another Republican Senator, Jeff Flake, said he would draft and introduce a bill to nullify the tariffs, adding: \"I urge my colleagues to pass it before this exercise in protectionism inflicts any more damage on the economy.\" But those who backed Mr Trump's move included Democratic Senator Joe Manchin who said it was \"past time to defend our interests, our security and our workers in the global economy\". Why did Donald Trump do this?\nIn his election campaign, Mr Trump pledged to protect American workers and to rebuild the steel and aluminium industries. The two metals are \"the backbone of our nation... the bedrock of our defence-industrial base\", the president said at Thursday's signing ceremony. \"Our greatest presidents from Washington, to Jackson, to Lincoln, to McKinley and others - they protected our country from outside influence, from other countries coming in and stealing our wealth and stealing our jobs and stealing our companies,\" he said. \"And we're going to be very fair, we're going to be very flexible, but we're going to protect the American worker, as I said I would do in my campaign.\" Correspondents say Mr Trump is aiming to appeal to blue-collar voters in states such as Pennsylvania who turned away from the Democrats to support him in 2016. What could happen next?\nMr Trump has said that the US would \"win big\" in any trade war. Some countries are likely to take the US to court, arguing that the decision violates World Trade Organization rules. The White House, however, says that the national security rationale for the move is \"unassailable\" and national security considerations are allowed under WTO rules. The director of UK Steel said the tariffs would have a profound and detrimental impact on the UK steel sector. \"Imposing such measures on US allies in the name of national security is difficult to comprehend,\" Gareth Stace added.

        "content": "Jeremy Clarkson will be grilling contestants as the new host of ITV quiz show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? It's returning for a week this spring to celebrate its 20th anniversary. The ex-Top Gear presenter is replacing previous host Chris Tarrant, who said in 2014 his days as a game show host were over and that he thought the programme had \"run its course\". On Friday, Clarkson said: \"I have always loved the show and am thrilled to be involved with its rebirth.\" The Grand Tour presenter described himself as a \"big fan\" of quiz shows, saying: \"I'm looking forward to hosting this iconic TV show and hopefully making a few millionaires.\" Can't wait to get cracking with Millionaire. Always loved that show. End of Twitter post by @JeremyClarkson The show, which sees contestants asked a series of increasingly difficult questions as they try to win the \u00a31m prize, will run for seven nightly hour-long episodes. The elusive jackpot can only be won if all 15 questions are answered successfully. A series of lifelines are offered, including asking the audience, asking a friend or taking a 50:50 option. ITV has promised \"a number of new twists and turns\" for the show's return. It managed ratings as high as 19 million viewers in 1999. Millionaire went on to become a hugely popular global TV format, with versions in countries including the US, India, Australia, Japan and Russia, and it inspired Danny Boyle's Oscar-winning film Slumdog Millionaire. ITV's head of entertainment Siobhan Greene said: \"I hope Millionaire will be introduced to a whole new generation. And with TV legend Jeremy Clarkson asking the questions, frankly anything could happen. I can't wait.\" In the UK, just five contestants managed to walk away with the \u00a31m prize. Tarrant, who hosted for 15 years, was expert at ratcheting up tension in the studio with long pauses between questions and answers.

        "content": "Former world number one Serena Williams won her first singles match on the WTA Tour for nearly 14 months as she returned after the birth of her child. The American, 36, reached the second round at Indian Wells with a 7-5 6-3 victory over Kazakhstan's Zarina Diyas. It was her first singles match on the Tour since she won the 2017 Australian Open while pregnant. \"I'm a little rusty but it doesn't matter,\" said the 23-time Grand Slam singles champion. \"It definitely wasn't easy but it was good.\" Williams was given a standing ovation as she walked onto court. Her husband Alexis Ohanian was in the crowd as she set up a second-round match with 29th-seeded Dutch player Kiki Bertens. Williams gave birth to daughter Alexis Olympia on 1 September. She says post-childbirth health complications - including blood clots in her lungs - were almost fatal. Williams missed this year's Australian Open in January because she did not consider herself ready for the tournament. She played an exhibition match in Abu Dhabi in late December and a doubles rubber for the US Fed Cup team against the Netherlands last month. Speaking after her win over Diyas, she said: \"It was incredible. It's been over a year and a kid later. \"I'm just out here on this journey doing the best I can.\" Media playback is not supported on this device BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller Williams did not fluff too many lines on her latest opening night. Given she had not played a competitive singles match for 404 days, this was an impressive return. Diyas showed plenty of resilience, saving five break points - but crucially not a sixth - in the first set, and twice breaking back when Williams hit the front in the second. Williams' serve proved a strong foundation, especially in the first set, and there were some powerful and sweetly struck winners amid some inevitable rust. The best part of 10,000 people were in Stadium Court 1 to watch Williams' return. One was her sister Venus, a potential third-round opponent. Victoria Azarenka - another former world number one - also made a winning return in California, beating British number two Heather Watson 6-4 6-2. Azarenka, a two-time Australian Open champion, was playing for the first time since Wimbledon last year. She withdrew from the 2018 Australian Open because of the ongoing custody battle over her 11-month-old son. The 28-year-old Belarusian encountered few problems on her return against Watson, 25, and said after the match that she only knew she would be able to play in Indian Wells a week ago. Asked how the past few months had been, Azarenka added: \"They weren't fun. \"I wouldn't wish that on anybody to go through what I've been going through, but it's part of life and there are blessings in this situation as well for me. \"I'm free but it's definitely been and still is a really difficult situation to be in and it's hard to only focus on playing tennis. \"One day I'll write a book about this, because it's Hollywood-worthy for sure. But right now I just want to keep it a little bit private.\" Azarenka said she would also compete at the Miami Open, starting on 19 March. ",

        "content": "Stalker Callum Blake-O'Brien created numerous fake social media accounts to send women what prosecutors described as \"unimaginably horrendous\" messages. One teenager left \"emotionally numb\" by his unrelenting abuse says he \"handpicked\" his victims to cause maximum distress. \"When I read it, I felt really sick. It was talking about rape and torture. \"I took a screenshot. It was extremely long and in extremely graphic detail.\" Gemma, not her real name, told the BBC how she got her first message from him one night in March 2017, when she was in her bedroom. \"I only read the first few lines; I couldn't read on and my parents read the rest of it. \"My mum said 'you should go to the police'. I was freaked out.\" Gemma, who was then 17, initially wondered if the message was \"some kind of joke\". She tried to find out who had sent it, but the communication was from an anonymous account that had been deactivated. \"By the time I read it, he had already created another account and starting sending other disturbing messages. \"The messages included one telling me I should not be afraid of dark alleyways because he preferred the daylight.\" They then started to include personal information about Gemma's family, including her father's work. One even mentioned her eye colour. \"I wrote back 'who is this?' and asked 'why are you doing this?'\" Blake-O'Brien, from Hereford, sent more abusive messages in response. Within days, her family had reported the messages to West Mercia Police. Though Gemma went to the police station armed with screenshots, she was disappointed by the officer's response.

Reports are made by people or authorities worried about online abuse, or the way someone is communicating online, and should be filed immediately. \"The dismissal by the police made me feel even more isolated,\" says Gemma, now aged 18. \"I did deactivate my account a few times and kept blocking him but he created new accounts. \"In all, he sent me about 75 to 100 messages from five different accounts. \"I became emotionally numb to the messages but the feeling he could hurt me never went away. \"I felt like I couldn't go out and became anxious - and I've never been anxious before.\" After a few weeks, the messages abruptly stopped. April and May passed without incident, but the reprieve was short-lived. \"I was on the phone to my friend when I got another message request in June. I knew exactly what it was and who it was from. I was devastated. \"It had given me a bit of false hope when it stopped between April and June and I thought he had finally got the message.\" Gemma reluctantly went back to the police but this time saw a female officer and a detective who she said \"took this seriously\". \"I think she understood his power and how I was feeling.\" The officers soon linked the case to a police report by another woman who had received similar messages. Two weeks later Blake-O'Brien was arrested. \"When I found out he was arrested in Hereford I completely broke down. It was the thought he could have walked past me multiple times,\" Gemma recalls. Her shock was further compounded when officers told her the name of the suspect - it was someone who had known her brother. \"He had handpicked all of us; either he knew us or had come into contact with us.\" The Crown Prosecution Service said Blake-O'Brien targeted several women. The 25-year-old knew some of the victims and was acquainted with others, it said. At Worcester Crown Court, he admitted counts against 10 women and was last month given a prison sentence of two and a half years. Seven offences were of stalking involving the fear of violence, while three involved sending an electronic communication of an indecent or grossly offensive nature. Blake-O'Brien will spent 15 months on licence, and was also handed a 10-year restraining order banning him from contacting any of his victims. He is further prohibited from using any device capable of accessing the internet unless it has the capacity to retain and display the history of online use. Though relieved her stalker has been bought to justice, looking back, Gemma feels upset about how the case was handled. She wants Facebook to introduce a helpdesk so people can easily report online abuse and believes the police, prosecution and defence counsel had a \"limited understanding\" of how social media worked. \"[That] shouldn't be the case as these crimes will increase in the future. \"I'm a teenage girl and I couldn't enjoy that whole year of my life.\" Det Insp Ross Jones, of West Mercia Police, urged anyone dissatisfied with how they were dealt with by officers to lodge a complaint with the force. He also praised the victims for coming forward. \"Their bravery played a vital role in achieving this custodial sentence. \"Despite this, I know that victims of such crimes can experience long-lasting effects on their mental health and wellbeing. \"All of the people who reported Blake-O'Brien's offences to us have been offered specialist counselling to help them. \"West Mercia Police works hard to ensure all officers know how to deal with reports of offences like this, and will continue to do so.\" ",

        "content": "Russia was not involved in the attempted murder of an ex-spy and is willing to help with a UK inquiry, the country's foreign minister has said. Sergei Lavrov said Russia has not yet been approached by UK authorities investigating the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the pair remained in a \"very serious\" condition. Ms Rudd is visiting Salisbury, where they were exposed to a nerve agent in an \"outrageous\" attack on Sunday. Ms Rudd was seen at the bench where Mr Skripal and his daughter collapsed in the city centre, which remains cordoned off by police. On Thursday afternoon there was a \"flurry of activity\" in Salisbury as investigators wearing protective suits went into Mr Skripal's house, as they try to ascertain where the pair were exposed to the nerve agent. It is known that Mr Skripal and his daughter had visited the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found near the Maltings shopping centre. Police said 21 people had been seen for medical treatment in the aftermath of the incident, but only three people were being treated. Det Sgt Nick Bailey - who attended the scene on Sunday - is stable and conscious but is \"very anxious\" about being exposed to a nerve agent. Former Russian military security colonel Mr Skripal, 66, was convicted by the Russian government of passing secrets to MI6, but given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a \"spy swap\". Former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Blair said the \"extraordinary attack in Salisbury\" is a good reason to investigate whether there is a pattern of former British intelligence collaborators dying in the UK. The attempted murder of Mr Skripal has drawn comparisons to the 2006 assassination of Alexander Litvinenko, who ingested the rare and highly radioactive Polonium 210 in London.

        "content": "A UN aid convoy has managed to enter the rebel-held area of Eastern Ghouta in Syria which has been under intense bombardment, officials say. Food and medical supplies have arrived in the town of Douma, the International Committee for the Red Cross said. It follows a pause in Syrian government air strikes overnight, with the situation in the besieged enclave on Friday described as \"calm\". A previous delivery of aid to the region was cut short amid shelling. \"Today, they will deliver the remaining aid that wasn't delivered during the previous convoy of 5 March,\" a spokeswoman for the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC), Ingy Sedky, said. \"We also have some positive indications that a bigger convoy with additional supplies including medical items might happen next week,\" Ms Sedky added. Friday's delivery is the third attempt this week to get humanitarian aid to civilians trapped by the fighting in the region on the edge of the Syrian capital, Damascus. On Monday, a convoy of 46 trucks delivered some provisions to Douma but was forced to turn back. A second attempt was later made to deliver the aid that agencies had failed to offload, but this was cancelled at the last minute due to security concerns. While ICRC officials expect this latest convoy to successfully deliver its cargo, humanitarian organisations say it is not nearly enough aid for the estimated 400,000 people trapped in the area. More than 900 civilians have been killed in the Eastern Ghouta region since the Russian-backed government assault was launched on 18 February, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) monitoring group, which has a network of sources on the ground. Many of the victims are children. On Friday, the air strikes reportedly ceased briefly, with the enclave seeing its calmest night in more than a week, the SOHR said. The Syrian government and its key ally Russia say a daily five-hour pause, which began in principle last week, does not apply to the targeting of some of the rebel groups within Eastern Ghouta. Forces loyal to the Syrian government have now reportedly taken half of the area - the last rebel-held enclave close to Damascus. ",

Jo Min-ki had been accused of molesting at least eight people amid a string of #MeToo allegations in the country. The actor was found dead at his home in Seoul, according to news agency Yonhap and the Korea Times, who cited police. Min-Ki's roles were mainly in TV shows, but he also appeared in a number of films. He was due to be questioned by police next week, the reports said. The 52-year-old was one of the biggest names to be embroiled in South Korea's #MeToo movement. He was accused of sexually harassing and raping students at Cheongju University, where he had taught for the past few years. Jo was dismissed from his post last month as a result of the allegations. He initially denied any wrongdoing, but released a statement on 27 February apologising to his accusers. \"Everything is my fault, and I am the one to blame,\" he said. \"I am deeply sorry to all the victims for the pain I've caused, and from here on out, I will not avoid the social and legal consequences of my mistakes.\" The actor was also edited out of TV drama Children of the Small God and replaced by Lee Jae Yong.

        "content": "The Winter Paralympics are set to take place in Pyeongchang, with the opening ceremony on Friday and competition starting the following day. The event will feature 670 athletes competing for 80 medals across six sports. Here's the day-by-day guide to what to look out for at Pyeongchang 2018 - and the likely highlights for Great Britain and other leading nations. Medals to be decided Para-alpine skiing: 6 Biathlon: 6 The opening day of competition features two of Britain's main medal hopes starting their campaigns in the Para-alpine skiing by taking on the downhill course at the Jeongseon Alpine Centre. Millie Knight and guide Brett Wild are the downhill world champions but have not hit top form this season, while Menna Fitzpatrick and Jen Kehoe will be chasing a medal on their Paralympic debut. The main challenge is likely to come from defending Paralympic champion Henrieta Farkasova of Slovakia. In the seated and standing classes, Anna Schaffelhuber of Germany and France's Marie Bochet will also be aiming to retain their titles. Scott Meenagh, who only took up Nordic skiing 18 months ago, will be making his Paralympic debut in the 7.5km seated biathlon - one of six medals up for grabs in the sport on day one - and one of six events the Scot is entered for across biathlon and cross-country skiing. Wheelchair curling starts with Great Britain, bronze medallists four years ago, facing defending world champions Norway in their opening round-robin match, while the first session of Para-ice hockey games also take place.

After the downhill on day one, it is the super-G on day two. Four years ago in Sochi, Kelly Gallagher created history with guide Charlotte Evans when they won Britain's first Winter Paralympic gold medal in the event. Since then, the Northern Irish skier has overcome the departure of Evans from the partnership and suffered a number of injuries - including a dislocated elbow and fractured ribs in a training crash, which kept her out of last year's World Championships. It hasn't been the smoothest of preparations but Gallagher and new guide Gary Smith will be hoping to put on a good display. The cross-country skiing programme starts with American Oksana Masters, a strong favourite in the women's 12km sitting event. Masters was born in Ukraine, near the Chernobyl nuclear plant, and was adopted at the age of seven by American speech therapy professor Gay Masters. She won rowing bronze at London 2012 - before switching to skiing and winning silver and bronze in Sochi. A gold would complete her medal collection nicely. The USA are seeking a third successive Paralympic gold in the Para ice hockey - their first opponents are Japan, who won silver in 2010 but missed out on Sochi.

Having had no athletes in Sochi four years ago, Britain will have Owen Pick, Ben Moore and James Barnes-Miller creating history when they go in the snowboard cross event. Pick lost his leg while serving in Afghanistan in 2011; Moore and Barnes-Miller go in the events for athletes with arm impairments. Moore won a World Championship bronze in snowboard cross in 2015 while Barnes-Miller was fourth in last year's worlds. Elsewhere, Canadian skiing star Brian McKeever will bid to add to his 10 Paralympic cross-country gold medals in the 20km freestyle event for visually impaired athletes. The wheelchair curling round-robin continues, with GB facing Sweden and then Canada.

Millie Knight and Brett Wild won silver at last year's worlds in the women's VI category but Menna Fitzpatrick and Jen Kehoe are second in the world rankings behind Henrieta Farkasova of Slovakia and her guide Natalia Subrtova. In the men's standing category, Aleksei Bugaev is the defending Paralympic champion. The Russian - competing under the Neutral Paralympic Athlete (NPA) banner - has been cleared to take part in Pyeongchang. However, Australian Mitchell Gourley, Italy's Robin Cuche and Markus Salcher of Austria filled the top three places at last year's Worlds and lead the rankings going into the Games. In the biathlon, the middle-distance events (10km/12.5km) take place with Scott Meenagh, who lost both legs serving in Afghanistan, going for Britain in the 12.5km seated event, where Germany's Martin Fleig will hope to add Paralympic gold to his world title. It's a busy day for the GB wheelchair curling team of Aileen Neilson, Gregor Ewan, Bob McPherson, Hugh Nibloe and Angie Malone. The round-robin phase of the competition continues and they face games against Slovakia and the NPA.

Britain's James Whitley, who will be competing in his second Games at the age of 20, will be hoping for a top-10 place, having finished 15th four years ago. Whitley was born without hands and has had multiple operations to construct fingers, but he has limited feeling and movement, and skis without poles. The visually impaired category could be a battle between Canada's Mac Marcoux, 20, and Italian teenager Giacomo Bertagnolli. Elsewhere, it's a big day of action at the cross-country skiing - with the sprint events taking place across all six categories and taking in qualification, semi-finals and finals. In qualification, athletes race against the clock but in the semi-finals and finals, it is a mass start involving six athletes in the seated and standing categories, and four athletes plus guides in the visually impaired categories, which can result in thrills and spills. Four years ago, Canada's Brian McKeever fell at the start of his race and found himself adrift of the rest of the field but still managed to recover and win gold.

The women's seated category could be an all-German battle with defending champion Anna Schaffelhuber up against team-mate Anna-Lene Forster. However, Austria's Claudia Losch finished the season as the overall World Cup winner and could spoil the German party. Favourite for the standing event will be France's Marie Bochet, who has dominated this season. It is also an important day in the wheelchair curling, with the final three rounds of pool games taking place before the semi-finals. The final four in the Para-ice hockey will also be in action with the USA hoping to make it three gold medals in a row in the event.

In the event, competitors have three runs down the course, with the best time counting. In the women's events, American Brenna Huckaby, who travels on the World Cup circuit with her 17-month-old daughter, will be favourite in the SB-LL1 category - while the Dutch duo of Lisa Bunschoten and Bibian Mentel-Spee look strong in the SB-LL2 event. A Mentel-Spee victory would be an emotional one, as she has been having radiation treatment for cancer over the past couple of years. It is another busy and gruelling day for the biathletes, including Britain's Scott Meenagh, as they go in the longest event, which covers 12.5km for the women and 15km for the men. The wheelchair curling reaches the semi-final stage, with Great Britain hoping to be involved.

Sit-skier Christoph Kunz won gold in his category four years ago and will be a contender again but Jeroen Kampschreur of the Netherlands is the world champion, one of his three world titles. Kampschreur, who is the first Dutch Para-alpine skier to win a world title, is a double above-the-knee amputee and also played wheelchair basketball at junior level for the Netherlands. In the cross-country events, the men's 10km classic event provides another medal chance for Canada's Brian McKeever, who is bidding for a fifth successive title in the event. France's Thomas Clarion won silver behind McKeever at last year's worlds - but was more than 30 seconds behind the Canadian. Medals are up for grabs in the wheelchair curling - four years ago, it was Norway who beat Russia to the gold, with Great Britain taking bronze.

Again, Henrieta Farkasova and guide Natalia Subrtova will provide the main challenge at the Jeongseon Alpine Centre. There should be a good contest in the standing category between defending champion Marie Bochet from France and German rival Andrea Rothfuss, who is the current world champion. Rothfuss, who took slalom gold in Sochi four years ago, won her world title by 0.71 seconds and another close race is expected. The last of the 80 medals will be awarded in the Para-ice hockey event, in which the USA have won gold at the past two Games.

        "content": "The 2018 Winter Paralympics will feature almost 600 athletes competing in 80 events across six sports. It represents a notable increase on the 547 athletes who took part in the Sochi Games four years ago. All have their own stories to tell of how they got to be part of one of the biggest sporting events in the world. BBC Sport looks at some of the British team members hoping to shine in Pyeongchang, plus some of the international stars bidding to make an impact. Para-alpine skiing pairing Menna and Jen, as they are better known, will be one of GB's leading medal hopes on their Paralympic debuts. Fitzpatrick, 19, has been skiing since childhood despite being born with congenital retinal folds that mean she has no vision in her left eye and limited sight in her right eye. Her guide Kehoe (34) is also an experienced skier and has been given time off from her role as an officer with the Royal Engineers to pursue the partnership with Fitzpatrick, which sees them descend the slopes at speeds of up to 100km/h while communicating via bluetooth headsets. Pyeongchang will be particularly special for Kehoe, who was on track to compete as a guide at the Sochi Paralympics before she suffered a serious knee injury. The pair have been in impressive form this season and will go in all five events in Pyeongchang as they chase a first Paralympic medal. Less than two years after taking up skiing, the 28-year-old Scot finds himself ready to take on arguably the most gruelling Winter Paralympic challenges in the cross country and biathlon events. Meenagh, a former Scotland under-18 rugby player, lost both his legs after stepping on an IED (improvised explosive device) while serving with the Army in Afghanistan. He took up rowing as part of his rehabilitation and became part of the GB Para-rowing squad, narrowly missing out on a place at the Rio Games, and also represented his country in the sport at the 2014 and 2016 Invictus Games, and in athletics at the 2017 event. But it is in nordic skiing that he will make his Games debut as Britain's first Paralympic representative in the sport for 20 years. Traditionally, the pathway from newcomer to elite competitor in the sport is between eight and 10 years - Meenagh has exceeded expectations by qualifying for Pyeongchang in a particularly short timescale, and is set to take part in six events across the two disciplines. Like Meenagh, Pick saw his life changed forever in Afghanistan. He was 18 and on his first tour of duty in the country when he suffered serious injuries to his leg after an explosion in January 2010. After lengthy treatment in the UK, his leg was amputated below the knee in August 2011. Pick, now 26, saw snowboarding on television while he was recovering and tried it for the first time on a trip to Colorado before going on an instructor's course. He made his competition debut in 2014 and has developed rapidly as he worked towards becoming one of the trio, along with Ben Moore and James Barnes-Miller, who will become Britain's first Paralympic snowboarders. Pick won silver in the banked slalom at last year's World Championships and is targeting going one better in South Korea, where he will also compete in the snowboard cross event. Cross country specialist McKeever has 10 Winter Paralympic gold medals to his name already and while Gert Schonfelder's all-time record of 16 will be beyond his reach for these Games, success in Pyeongchang will see him inch closer to the German's mark. The 38-year-old, who will be at his fifth Games, competes in the visually impaired category, having started to lose his sight aged 19 as a result of Stargardts disease, a congenital condition. He looked set to create history in 2010 when, as well as being named on the Canadian Paralympic team, he was selected for the country's Olympic squad. However, he was controversially not chosen to race in the 50km classic event - a decision that he said left him \"crushed\" - but he recovered from that disappointment to win three Paralympic golds, and repeated the feat four years later in Sochi. McKeever's immense talent means finding a suitable guide for him presents plenty of challenges. His older brother Robin filled the role for a number of years before current guide Graham Nishikawa took over for Sochi. His back-up guide Russell Kennedy already has experience of Pyeongchang having competed with the Canadian Olympic team last month. If 23-year-old skier Walsh wants some advice on how to deal with the pressure of a Paralympic Games, he does not have to go too far for help. Walsh is a good friend of Olympic giant slalom champion Mikaela Shiffrin - the pair went to pre-school in Vail, Colorado together and Shiffrin's mother was Walsh's first ski teacher - and they have stayed friends since. Nine years ago Walsh was diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma - a bone and soft tissue cancer. Part of his lungs and pelvis were removed and his Olympic dreams were at an end. But he recovered and took Shiffrin to his school prom in 2012 and, after going to watch his friend in action in Sochi four years ago, he learned to love skiing again, joining the US Paralympic team in December 2015. Walsh finished 10th in the super-G and 19th in the super combined at last year's World Championships and while a gold medal would be a big ask, he will have one of the biggest stars of the sport cheering him all the way. With both Paralympic and Winter Paralympic titles to his name, Bowden has nothing to prove - but Canada's failure to win Para-ice hockey gold since 2006 is an extra incentive for the 34-year-old to keep going at the elite level. Bowden, who was born with a condition similar to spina bifida, won wheelchair basketball gold with Canada at the 2004 Paralympics in Athens but Para-ice hockey (or sledge hockey, as it has previously been known) has always had a special part in his life. Two years after his first Paralympic title, he made it a double by helping Canada claim gold in Turin as they beat Norway in the final. The team disappointed on home soil in 2010, finishing without a medal but won bronze four years ago, watching on as the United States took up the mantle of the top team in the world. But with Bowden, previously a star in attack, now playing a more defensive role, Canada beat their North American rivals 4-1 to win last year's World Championship and they are confident they can finish on top of the podium again on the biggest stage of all. Four years ago in Sochi, Mentel-Spee was on top of the world after winning the first ever female Para-snowboarding gold medal in the snowboard cross event, but the subsequent four years have been a challenge for the Dutch woman. She was a talented able-bodied snowboarder in her younger days, competing at World Cup level, and qualified for the 2002 Olympics before being diagnosed with cancer and having her leg amputated as part of her treatment. Mentel-Spee relearned her snowboarding skills and earned victory in Sochi as well as two world titles in snowboard cross and banked slalom in 2017, which should have put her in good stead for Pyeongchang. Since then, however, she has needed more treatment for cancer and has had surgery twice in the past six months, most recently in January. But the 45-year-old wants to take her place in South Korea. \"For me it is more important to compete there than to win,\" she says. \"Just being at the event with all my friends and showcasing the sport, that is the most important thing for me. I'm not really thinking about the results.\" Masters' story echoes that of fellow US Paralympian Tatyana McFadden. She too was adopted from an orphanage as a youngster (aged seven) and brought to the US by her adoptive mother before going on to shine on the sporting stage. She was born in Ukraine near the Chernobyl nuclear plant and suffered from a number of birth defects to her limbs which eventually resulted in both legs being amputated and her having to have multiple reconstructive surgeries to her hands. But she found a passion for sport, winning bronze in rowing at the London 2012 Paralympics before switching to cross country skiing and taking a bronze and a silver home from Sochi. The 28-year-old tried another sport for Rio, claiming two top-five finishes in Para-cycling as she recovered from a back injury, but she could not stay away from the nordic disciplines. She has improved her shooting skills for the biathlon events and as well as three cross country golds at last year's World Championships, added another gold and a bronze in the biathlon. The US has never won Paralympic gold in women's cross country or biathlon events and the smart money is on Masters being the first to achieve the feat in Pyeongchang. The fact Germany finished second in the medal table at the Sochi Winter Paralympics four years ago was largely down to Schaffelhuber. The sit-skier won gold medals in all five events on the Para-alpine skiing programme, to make up more than half of her nation's overall gold medal tally of nine. The 25-year-old, who was born with incomplete paraplegia which developed into complete paraplegia in 2009, will be competing in her third Games as she bids to defend all five titles. At last year's World Championships she won three golds and two silvers and in Pyeongchang will renew rivalries with the woman who beat her in those two events, Claudia Losch of Austria. The German says she is going to retire after Pyeongchang but can she go out on a high with another clean sweep of medals?\u2003 Of all the teams at the Pyeongchang Winter Paralympics, the one that will surely attract the most interest is the one made up of eligible Russian Para-athletes. While the Russian Paralympic Committee remains suspended after a report found evidence of state-sponsored doping, in January the International Paralympic Committee said it would allow selected athletes who had met strict conditions to compete as neutrals at the Games - just as the International Olympic Committee had done with last month's Winter Olympics. Known as neutral Paralympic athletes (NPA), they will compete under the Paralympic flag and the Paralympic anthem will be played in any ceremony. Athletes, who must have had at least two anti-doping tests in the past six months, will compete in alpine skiing, biathlon, cross country, snowboard and wheelchair curling. The Russian team topped the medal table in Sochi in 2014 with 80 medals, including 30 golds, but the 2018 team has a different look. Among those who have been named on the team are alpine skier Aleksei Bugaev - who won two golds, two silvers and a bronze in the standing category in Sochi and five golds at the 2015 World Championships - and fellow double Sochi gold medallists Aleksandra Frantseva and Valerii Redkozubov, who both compete in the visually impaired category. It will be a first appearance at a Winter Paralympics for North Korea after the country was given two invitational slots by the IPC for the Para-nordic skiing events. The two athletes who will take part are Ma You-chul and Kim Jung-hyun, who both compete in the seated events. Both made their international debuts at January's World Cup in Oberried, Germany, with funding from the Asian Paralympic Committee and the Agitos Foundation, and finished 34th and 35th respectively in the 7.5km event and 26th and 27th in the 15km event. However, unlike at the Olympics, they will not march with South Korean athletes under a unified flag at the opening ceremony. North Korea competed for the first time at the 2012 Paralympics with one swimmer taking part and three athletes represented the country at the 2016 Paralympics. It is not yet clear whether the loud and co-ordinated North Korean support evident during the Olympics will be in place for the Paralympics. ",

        "content": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump are to meet in person by May, it has been announced, an extraordinary overture after months of mutual hostility. News of the meeting was delivered by South Korean officials after talks with Mr Trump at the White House. They passed a verbal message from Mr Kim, saying the North Korean leader was \"committed to denuclearisation\". Mr Trump hailed \"great progress\" but said sanctions would remain in place. South Korea's President Moon Jae-in said the news \"came like a miracle\". \"If President Trump and Chairman Kim meet following an inter-Korean summit, complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula will be put on the right track in earnest,\" he said. China has welcomed the development, saying the Korean peninsula issue was \"heading in the right direction\" and calling for \"political courage\". However, correspondents say the North has halted missile and nuclear tests during previous talks, only to resume them when it lost patience or felt it was not getting what it demanded. The latest announcement came days after the South Korean delegation met Mr Kim in Pyongyang. Speaking outside the White House after briefing Mr Trump, South Korean National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong said he had passed on a message that Mr Kim was \"committed to denuclearisation\" and had \"pledged that North Korea will refrain from any further nuclear or missile tests\". In a statement sent to the Washington Post, North Korea's UN ambassador said the \"courageous decision\" of Mr Kim would help secure \"peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and the East Asia region\". There is no indication yet of where the Trump-Kim talks might take place, but the Korean border's demilitarised zone (DMZ) and Beijing are seen as likely options. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said it would take \"some weeks\" to arrange the talks and admitted the US had been \"surprised\" at Kim Jong-un's \"forward-leaning\" stance. Just a day earlier, Mr Tillerson had said the US was \"a long way\" from negotiations with the North. Moon's huge gamble\nAnalysis by BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul President Moon Jae-in has acknowledged there are obstacles ahead. He is managing expectations and so much can go wrong. His approval ratings took a hit during the Winter Olympics after he integrated the women's hockey team with players from the North and met a general from Pyongyang who had been accused of masterminding deadly attacks on South Koreans, though they have since rebounded. These talks are a huge gamble with a communist state which is hard to read. But if, just if, he helps pull it off, it may reduce the threat of nuclear war and he could win himself a Nobel Peace prize. If all fails, it is back to brinkmanship. Read Laura's piece in full How did we reach this point?\nNorth Korea has been isolated for decades because of its well-documented human rights abuses and its pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws. Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze. Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being planned! End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump It has carried out six nuclear tests, and has missiles that could reach the US. But South Korea's hosting of the Winter Olympics gave an unexpected window for diplomacy. South Korea then held landmark talks with Mr Kim in Pyongyang this week, returning home saying the North was willing to give up its nuclear weapons if it felt it had no reason to keep them. What has North Korea pledged?\nThere were four main elements to the statement delivered by Mr Chung: South Korea statement on Kim-Trump meeting in full The BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says it is important to note that North Korea has not yet promised to abandon its nuclear weapons completely. It also remains unclear exactly what it is asking for in return. Is this a victory for Trump?\nMr Trump has repeatedly belittled Kim Jong-un, and last year threatened him with \"fire and fury\" if North Korea continued to threaten the US. He has at times said there is no point in talking to North Korea. But Mr Chung made a point of saying it was Mr Trump's \"maximum pressure policy\" which had brought the parties to this point, a gesture which the president is likely to appreciate. Our correspondent says Kim Jong-un has also scored a propaganda win, first with the Olympics and now by being seen to reach out to the US. Former British ambassador to North Korea, John Everard, told the BBC there must be a suspicion that Mr Kim might be trying to play Mr Trump, to try to \"get him to say across the table things that North Korea has been asking for for a long time\". These could include a peace treaty to finally end the Korean War and a promise that if North Korea denuclearised then the US would finally withdraw its troops from South Korea. The US has tens of thousands of military personnel there and the massive annual joint war games infuriate the North, because it believes they are preparation for invasion. What about the other major players?\nPresident Moon, who is due to meet Mr Kim in April, said the Trump-Kim meeting \"will be recorded as a historic milestone that realised peace on the Korean peninsula\". The South's statement also credited \"international solidarity\" for the breakthrough, probably in part a reference to the ever-increasing international sanctions on North Korea. China, North Korea's main economic supporter, has in recent months toughened up its dealings with Pyongyang, including on key areas like petroleum and oil. This is thought to be putting a major strain on the North. Beijing has consistently pushed for all parties to talk and on Friday, China's foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said it welcomed the \"positive signals\" from the US and North Korea. \"We're glad that they have finally made this first step... The next key step is for all parties to maintain this momentum,\" Mr Geng said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the development was a \"step in the right direction\". \"It should not just be a meeting, it should open up a way to resuming a fully fledged diplomatic process to find a solution to the North Korean nuclear issue,\" he said. Japan, which saw North Korean missiles fly over its territory twice last year, responded with cautious optimism. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan would \"keep putting maximum pressure until North Korea takes concrete actions toward denuclearisation\", and said he hoped to meet Mr Trump ahead of the Kim summit. Have talks like this happened in the past?\nNo sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader, but there have been repeated attempts to get North Korea to denuclearise. The last major effort - the Six Party talks - collapsed in 2008, largely because North Korea refused to allow inspectors to verify that it had shut down its nuclear programme. A number of bids to restart the talks also collapsed, including in 2012 when North Korea launched another rocket, two weeks after announcing a \"leap day\" (29 February) agreement with the US that had promised food aid in return for inspections and a moratorium on missile tests.

        "content": "Russia was not involved in the attempted murder of an ex-spy and is willing to help with a UK inquiry, the country's foreign minister has said. Sergei Lavrov said Russia has not yet been approached by UK authorities investigating the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the pair remained in a \"very serious\" condition. Ms Rudd is visiting Salisbury, where they were exposed to a nerve agent in an \"outrageous\" attack on Sunday. The home secretary would not reveal any further details about the substance or how it was administered. She added police needed to be given space \"to do their investigation\". Ms Rudd was seen at the bench where Mr Skripal and his daughter collapsed in the city centre, which remains cordoned off by police. On Thursday afternoon there was a \"flurry of activity\" in Salisbury as investigators wearing protective suits went into Mr Skripal's house, as they try to ascertain where the pair were exposed to the nerve agent. It is known that Mr Skripal and his daughter had visited the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found near the Maltings shopping centre. The graves of Mr Skripal's wife and son at a Salisbury cemetery have also been taped off. Police said 21 people had been seen for medical treatment in the aftermath of the incident, but only three people were being treated. Det Sgt Nick Bailey - who attended the scene on Sunday - is stable and conscious but is \"very anxious\" about being exposed to a nerve agent. Former Russian military security colonel Mr Skripal, 66, was convicted by the Russian government of passing secrets to MI6, but given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a \"spy swap\". Former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Blair said the \"extraordinary attack in Salisbury\" is a good reason to investigate whether there is a pattern of former British intelligence collaborators dying in the UK. The attempted murder of Mr Skripal has drawn comparisons to the 2006 assassination of Alexander Litvinenko, who ingested the rare and highly radioactive Polonium 210 in London. On Tuesday Labour MP Yvette Cooper asked the home secretary to review 14 other deaths that had not been treated as suspicious by UK police, but have reportedly been identified by US intelligence sources as being connected to the Russian state. Ms Rudd has refused to speculate on whether the Russian state might have been involved in the attack, saying the police investigation should be based on \"facts, not rumour\".

Mr Fox says he will travel to Washington next week when he will discuss the new duties. He said: \"We will, of course, be looking to see how we can maximise the UK's case for exemption under these particular circumstances.\" Steel imports will carry a 25% tariff while aluminium will have a 10% duty. President Trump claims that the US has suffered from \"unfair trade\" and that the tariffs will boost the domestic market. Mr Fox said: \"We understand the anxieties about steel over-production that the United States has but we believe there are other ways to tackle that on a multilateral basis.\" Mr Trump's decision, which comes into effect in two weeks' time, has provoked widespread condemnation from the likes of China and France. It also prompted the resignation of Mr Trump's chief economic adviser Gary Cohn. 'Shooting itself in the foot'\nGareth Stace, director of UK Steel, said: \"Slapping a 25% tax on steel from British companies is going to hit us hard.\" He added: \"It worries me that I don't think the Trump administration has quantified what it can supply from its own market and what it can't. Therefore, it is actually shooting itself in the foot by increasing costs to the US steel sector and US manufacturing sector by 25%.\" UK exports of aluminium to the US are tiny, but the UK's Aluminium Federation fears a trade war all the same. Aluminium Federation president Giles Ashmead said: \"The proposed 10% tariff on aluminium entering the US is regrettable. \"While the US is not a major export market for UK-produced aluminium, indiscriminate tariffs are a hindrance to free trade, and do little to secure a 'level playing field' for global commerce.\" Canada and Mexico will be exempt from the tariffs while negotiations continue over the North America Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). The final round of Nafta talks is due to be held this spring in the US. ",

Lady Judge contests the allegations, and has accused the IoD of smearing her reputation. The IoD met on Thursday to discuss the contents of a report it commissioned into her alleged behaviour. The IoD frequently calls for better corporate governance in UK firms. Lady Judge reportedly made a number of derogatory comments to colleagues.

        "content": "Doctors from the Canadian province of Quebec have shocked the world by turning down a pay rise. Why would anyone turn down a pay rise? For doctors from Quebec, the answer is simple: patient care. An eight-year, retroactive deal struck in February would see about 20,000 of the province's medical specialists and general practitioners receive an annual salary increase ranging from about 1.4% to 1.8% each year. That would mean that the province, which subsidises the bulk of doctors' salaries, would be on the hook for an additional C$1.5bn ($1.2bn, \u00a3840m) by 2023. It is a fair agreement, according to the unions representing Quebec doctors, who pushed for the deal with the province. But not all physicians are on board - more than 700 physicians, both GPs and specialists, have signed a petition from M\u00e9decins Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Pour le R\u00e9gime Public saying they do not want the rise, and they would rather have the extra money go to patient care and services. The group represents doctors in the province who strongly support public access to healthcare. \"We, Quebec doctors, are asking that the salary increases granted to physicians be cancelled and that the resources of the system be better distributed for the good of the healthcare workers and to provide health services worthy to the people of Quebec,\" the letter posted on 26 February states. Within weeks, the number of signatures has grown from about 250 to more than 700. There are about 20,000 doctors in Quebec. Their cry for fairer distribution of government funding comes at a time when the healthcare system is under intense scrutiny. On Wednesday, an independent report commissioned by Quebec's Health and Welfare Commissioner found that physician salaries had doubled between 2005-15, while the hours doctors spent with patients declined. Meanwhile, the province's nurses are fighting for better working conditions and salaries. A picture of a bleary-eyed nurse posted on Facebook went viral and was shared more than 50,000 times in January. \u00ab La r\u00e9forme du syst\u00e8me de la sant\u00e9 est un succ\u00e8s \u00bb -Gaetan Barette Voici le visage des soins infirmiers.Hey mon... End of Facebook post by \u00c9milie \"I'm so stressed that I have back troubles, enough to keep me from sleeping. I don't want to go to work because I dread the workload that awaits me,\" wrote \u00c9milie Ricard, who said she alone was in charge of caring for 70 patients in one shift. \"I come home and I'm crying with fatigue.\" Both the report and the nursing crisis have left many doctors in the province with a feeling of \"shame\" for their salaries, says Dr Isabelle Leblanc, president of M\u00e9decins Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Pour le R\u00e9gime Public, which published the letter. \"We, Quebec doctors, are asking that the salary increases granted to physicians be cancelled and that the resources of the system be better distributed for the good of the healthcare workers and to provide health services worthy to the people of Quebec,\" read the letter. This sentiment has struck a chord with people across Canada and abroad. The letter was described as \"utterly Canadian\" by Washington Post reporter Amy B Wang. In Kenya, the doctors' letter was greeted with shock, especially since last year Kenyan doctors went on a three-month strike for higher wages. \"It is almost unheard of that a worker would complain of a high salary from their employer,\" wrote an article in the Kenya paper The Standard. At home, the Quebec doctors have been praised by officials, but some of their colleagues have kept mum. More like this:\n\"If they feel they are overpaid, they can leave the money on the table. I guarantee you I can make good use of it,\" said the province's health minister Ga\u00e9tan Barrette. Quebec's physician unions have not commented publicly about the call for less than the agreed-upon pay rise. In Canada, healthcare is public and run by the provinces, not the federal government, which means that salaries can vary quite a lot from province to province. The average salary for a physician nationwide was $339,000, according to the most recent data from the Canadian Institute for Health Information. In Ontario, Canada's largest province, the average specialist made C$403,500; in Quebec, they made C$367,000. Conversely, family physicians in Quebec made C$255,000, while in Ontario they made C$311,000. The Quebec doctors' rebuff of a pay rise has put them at odds with many of their colleagues in other provinces. The Ontario Medical Association has been fighting for higher wages with the province for years. The province has cut fees twice in three years and the association still has not negotiated a contract with the province. ",

        "content": "A serial sex attacker dubbed the M25 rapist has died in prison. Antoni Imiela, 63, who preyed upon women and girls across south-east England, was given seven life terms in 2004. In January, it emerged he was being considered for release after serving a total of 14 years in jail. The Prison Service said Imiela, who is understood to have had a heart condition, died at HMP Wakefield on Thursday. There were no suspicious circumstances, it added. Imiela moved to Appledore, near Ashford in Kent, in 1996 after serving a prison sentence for a series of robberies. Five years later he began a campaign of attacks - raping three girls and four women in 2001 and 2002. The locations of his attacks, in Kent, Surrey, Hertfordshire and west London, earned him the M25 rapist moniker. Imiela's trial at Maidstone Crown Court in 2004 heard how he targeted strangers - dragging his victims into secluded areas where he threatened to kill them. In March 2004, Imiela was convicted of the seven rapes, along with the kidnap, indecent assault and attempted rape of a 10-year-old girl, leading to seven life sentences. Dragged off the street\nWhile in prison, a cold case review took place into an attack in 1987 on a 31-year-old woman, which found a DNA match to Imiela. In 2012, he was sentenced to a further 12 years in prison after being found guilty of the attack. The jury was told he grabbed Sheila Jankowitz off the street in Sydenham in south-east London, put his hand over her mouth, dragged her on to waste ground and sexually assaulted her, before threatening her with a brick. Sentencing Imiela, Judge John Bevan told him: \"You are wholly unrepentant about your life of guns, rape and general violence and, despite having served eight years of your life sentence, you have not expressed one jot of remorse.\" Mrs Jankowitz died before her attacker was brought to justice. Speaking after the 2012 case, detectives said they believed it was likely Imiela had attacked further victims. A Prison Service spokeswoman said: \"As with all deaths in custody, there will be an independent investigation by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman.\" ",

Lady Judge said she wanted to make clear that she was seeking to have those individuals removed from their positions \"solely on the basis of their performance\". \"My acknowledgment that issues of race and pregnancy could complicate their removal both legally and from the standpoint of public perception is an observation I believe most lawyers would make, and that many non-lawyers also know to be true. I was addressing the likely consequences of their dismissal, not the reasons for it.\" Lady Judge apologised for the way she had expressed herself in that conversation: \"I realise I expressed myself in a way that sounds crude and insensitive. I regret that and apologise for it.\" Fourteen complainants\nA spokesman said the conversation was recorded by IoD director general, Stephen Martin, in a private conversation without Lady Judge's knowledge. She added: \"I, a woman lawyer who has broken many glass ceilings and who has advocated for women and minority rights my entire life, I'm glad that's the case.\" Lady Judge's term as chair was due to expire in May, and she was not seeking re-election. The IoD's investigation was conducted by Caroline Prosser, an employment lawyer from Hill Dickinson. She started to gather evidence for the IoD report in December 2017. Ms Prosser spoke to 14 complainants, who made 41 allegations. The IoD said on Friday: \"The council took the decision, having received the Hill Dickinson executive summary, to suspend the IoD chair pending further investigation into the matters raised and the process.\" ",

Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland might have expected a number of subjects to come under their control when the UK leaves the EU. However, ministers are bidding to oversee things like food labelling and animal welfare. The Scottish government has accused the UK government of a power grab and introduced its own legislation. Ministers at Westminster insist that \"the vast majority of powers returning from Brussels will start off in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast\". Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington, who is conducting talks with the devolved governments, said: \"There is a much smaller group of powers where the devolved governments will be required to follow current EU laws for a little bit longer while we work out a new UK approach.\" The 24 policy areas expected to require a UK legislative approach for a temporary period include: Mr Lidington told BBC Scotland that if these policy areas did not return to Westminster then there would be a loss of jobs and \"probably a higher price for consumers\". He explained: \"What will not help either customers or producers is to have different sets of food labelling or food hygiene or safety regulations in different parts of the UK. \"All that does is add to costs, loss of jobs amongst producers and it leads to less choice, probably a higher price for consumers. \"The same applies with manufactures, if you're a paint manufacturer in Wales you've got to stick to some chemical standards in producing your paint, but you want those to be the same as the paint standards in Scotland or NI because you are a customer there. It just makes sense that we do so much trade in internal borders in the UK that we have a set of common sense rules agreed. \"I hope between the different governments, laid out in legislation, that mean producers and consumers will benefit.\" 'This is a major power grab'\nFirst Ministers Nicola Sturgeon and Carwyn Jones are due to hold talks with the prime minister next week. Both the Scottish and Welsh governments have produced plans for continuity bills as a fallback option to deal with legal uncertainties caused by Brexit if they cannot agree to consent to the UK government's legislation. Responding to the publication, Holyrood's Brexit minister Mike Russell said: \"\"This list simply confirms the UK government's plans for a power grab. \"Under the EU Withdrawal Bill the UK will have the right to take control of any of the powers on this list. \"However, the publication of the categories demonstrates the threat is most immediate in key devolved areas such as agriculture, GM crops, fishing, environmental policy, public procurement, food standards and a range of other areas. \"Unless the bill is changed Westminster could soon be in control of these policies amounting to a major power grab and a re-writing of the devolution settlement the people of Scotland voted for so decisively.\" What are the 24 devolved policy areas?\nAgricultural support - Policies and regulations relating to income, market support, agriculture, productivity and maintenance grants.

        "content": "A Turkish court has sentenced 25 journalists to jail for alleged links to a group the government blames for a failed coup attempt in July 2016. Twenty-three of them were convicted of membership of an armed terrorist organisation and were given prison terms of up to seven and a half years. Two were convicted on lesser charges. They mainly worked for outlets close to the group of US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen. Ankara accuses him of heading the coup bid, which he denies. More than 50,000 people were arrested and 150,000 sacked or suspended from their jobs in the aftermath of the failed coup on 15 July 2016. Police, military personnel, teachers and public servants were among those ensnared in the crackdown. In the most recent trial, prominent journalist Murat Aksoy and pop singer and columnist Atilla Tas were given jail sentences of 25 and 37 months respectively, on charges of aiding a terrorist organisation without being a member. Both were allowed to go free because of the time they had already spent in jail. Many of those convicted worked for a prominent newspaper, Zaman, which authorities took control of in 2016. On Twitter (in Turkish), Murat Aksoy responded to the ruling, saying: \"My writings may have been critical but don't deserve to be punished. I also don't deserve to be punished, just for being a journalist.\" The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) condemned the convictions and called for all of those found guilty to be freed immediately. \"Turkish authorities must stop equating journalism with terrorism, and release the scores of press workers jailed for doing their job,\" CPJ Europe and Central Asia programme co-ordinator Nina Ognianova said in a statement. Meanwhile, the trial of 17 current and former writers, cartoonists and executives from the Cumhuriyet newspaper was set to resume on Friday. They face charges of aiding a terrorist organisation. Press freedom groups say media has been particularly hard hit in the post-coup crackdown led by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following the coup attempt. The mutiny led by military officers resulted in the deaths of 250 civilian protesters. The Turkish government says Gulen's influence must be purged from Turkish society. ",

        "content": "A UN aid convoy has managed to enter the rebel-held area of Eastern Ghouta in Syria which has been under intense bombardment, officials say. For the first time since Monday, food and medicine got into the town of Douma, the Red Cross said. It follows a pause in Syrian government air strikes overnight, with the situation in the besieged enclave on Friday described as \"calm\". A previous delivery of aid to the region was cut short amid shelling. \"Today, they will deliver the remaining aid that wasn't delivered during the previous convoy of 5 March,\" a spokeswoman for the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC), Ingy Sedky, said. \"We also have some positive indications that a bigger convoy with additional supplies including medical items might happen next week,\" Ms Sedky added. Friday's delivery is the third attempt this week to get humanitarian aid to civilians trapped by the fighting in the region on the edge of the Syrian capital, Damascus. But reports of renewed shelling near Douma have put the latest aid effort at risk. Ali al-Zatari, the UN humanitarian co-ordinator in Syria, said any bombardment of the area during the delivery of aid was in breach of \"assurances of safety from parties including the Russian Federation\", AFP news agency reports. On Monday, a convoy of 46 trucks delivered some provisions to Douma but was forced to turn back. A second attempt was later made to deliver the aid that agencies had failed to offload, but this was cancelled at the last minute due to security concerns. While ICRC officials expect this latest convoy to successfully deliver its cargo, humanitarian organisations say it is not nearly enough aid for the estimated 400,000 people trapped in the area. More than 900 civilians have been killed in the Eastern Ghouta region since the Russian-backed government assault was launched on 18 February, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) monitoring group, which has a network of sources on the ground. Many of the victims are children. On Friday, the air strikes reportedly ceased briefly, with the enclave seeing its calmest night in more than a week, the SOHR said. The Syrian government and its key ally Russia say a daily five-hour pause, which began in principle last week, does not apply to the targeting of some of the rebel groups within Eastern Ghouta. Forces loyal to the Syrian government have now reportedly taken half of the area - the last rebel-held enclave close to Damascus. ",

        "content": "Flippy the burger-flipping robot that started work this week in a California restaurant has been forced to take a break because it was too slow. The robot was installed at a Cali Burger outlet in Pasadena and replaced human cooks. But after just one day at work the robot has been taken offline, so it can be upgraded to cook more quickly. Its human helpers are also getting extra training to help it keep up with demand at the restaurant. Handy helper\nUSA Today reported that the robot was still in place behind the grill at the burger joint but was switched off. A sign said the robot would be \"cooking soon\" but gave no date for when it would once again be flipping hamburger patties. The robot is believed to have been given time off because news about it spread widely, and led to more interest and orders than the restaurant could handle. In a statement Miso Robotics, which made Flippy, said it was testing the code that controls the robot to ensure that it can cook quickly enough to fulfill orders at peak times. Prior to starting work, Flippy was said to be capable of cooking up to 2,000 burgers a day. Cali Burger said it was also working with staff to show them the best way to prepare and place the raw patties and other ingredients in its burgers to ensure Flippy works as fast as possible. Anthony Lomelino, head of technology at Cali Burger, told USA Today that kitchen staff needed to learn to \"choreograph\" their movements around the motions of the mobile, spatula-fitted arm which Flippy uses to cook. Cali said that it started to use the robot to get around the problems it has recruiting staff. The high turnover rate among staff in fast-food restaurants meant it often spent time and money training people to prepare food only to have them leave after a few months. Eventually, said the chain, burger-flipping robots will be installed in up to 50 of its restaurants. ",

        "content": "The UK will seek an exemption from President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to the US, according to Trade Secretary Liam Fox. Mr Fox says he will travel to Washington next week when he will discuss the new duties. He said: \"We will, of course, be looking to see how we can maximise the UK's case for exemption under these particular circumstances.\" Steel imports will carry a 25% tariff while aluminium will have a 10% duty. President Trump claims that the US has suffered from \"unfair trade\" and that the tariffs will boost the domestic market. Mr Fox said: \"We understand the anxieties about steel over-production that the United States has but we believe there are other ways to tackle that on a multilateral basis.\" Mr Trump's decision, which comes into effect in two weeks' time, has provoked widespread condemnation from the likes of China and France. It also prompted the resignation of Mr Trump's chief economic adviser Gary Cohn. 'Shooting itself in the foot'\nGareth Stace, director of UK Steel, said: \"Slapping a 25% tax on steel from British companies is going to hit us hard.\" He added: \"It worries me that I don't think the Trump administration has quantified what it can supply from its own market and what it can't. Therefore, it is actually shooting itself in the foot by increasing costs to the US steel sector and US manufacturing sector by 25%.\" A spokesman for steelmaker ArcelorMittal said the industry faced a number of problems: \"The steel industry has been characterised in recent years by overcapacity, high levels of imports and unfair trade. \"We have appreciated the efforts made by governments to address unfair imports in support of a level playing field. Fundamentally a solution must be found to address the high level of overcapacity that still exists. This is particularly important given steel's globally traded nature.\" 'Regrettable' move\nUK exports of aluminium to the US are tiny, but the UK's Aluminium Federation fears a trade war all the same. Aluminium Federation president Giles Ashmead said: \"The proposed 10% tariff on aluminium entering the US is regrettable. \"While the US is not a major export market for UK-produced aluminium, indiscriminate tariffs are a hindrance to free trade, and do little to secure a 'level playing field' for global commerce.\" Canada and Mexico will be exempt from the tariffs while negotiations continue over the North America Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). The final round of Nafta talks is due to be held this spring in the US. ",

        "content": "A slowdown in housebuilding in January contributed to the biggest monthly decline in construction output since June 2012. Construction output fell by 3.4% in January from December, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The UK statistics body said the construction sector remained \"a weak spot\" in the economy. Separate ONS data showed growth in the manufacturing sector slowed in January, while the trade deficit widened. 'Toxic combination'\nThe ONS said the fall in construction in January stemmed from a decline in all new work. It said the main contribution to the fall came from private housing, although that followed a record high reached in December. Ole Black, a senior statistician at the ONS, said: \"Construction continues to be a weak spot in the UK economy with a big drop in commercial developments, along with a slowdown in housebuilding after its very strong end to last year.\" The government has been trying to boost home construction in an attempt to give more people the opportunity to buy their own property. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Theresa May announced reforms to planning rules in England to try to get housebuilders to build more properties. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \"Rising interest rates and Brexit uncertainty are proving to be a toxic combination for the construction sector. \"The sharp decline in output in January primarily reflected an 8.3% month-to-month collapse in new work in the private housing sector. He added that he doubted that housebuilding would see a quick recovery. \"The prospect of further increases in interest rates is subduing buyer demand both for new and existing homes.\" Production rebound\nThe ONS said growth in the manufacturing sector slowed to 0.1% in January from 0.3% in December. However, despite the slowdown, the sector has now expanded for nine months in a row for the first time since records began in 1968. The wider measure of industrial production grew 1.3%, rebounding from a 1.3% decline in December. Output was helped by the reopening of the Forties oil pipeline, which had been shut for repairs. The trade deficit in goods and services widened by \u00a3600m to \u00a33.1bn between December and January. The ONS said the deficit widened as rising oil prices led to more expensive fuel imports. ",

        "content": "\"There can be so much disappointment and loneliness because we are encouraged to aspire and have ambitions - and then what happens when we fail? \"Maybe exam results aren't good enough. The ideal you've been built up for - like being a footballer, being a doctor - doesn't happen.\" This 20-year-old woman, interviewed for a study on youth loneliness, captures the sense of pressure and isolation many young people say they feel. The research, by Manchester Metropolitan University and the young person's mental health charity 42nd Street, suggests youngsters often feel isolated and lonely when they fail to live up to expectations. The youth-led research project - which specifically recruited young researchers aged 14 to 25 to interview 140 youngsters from a diverse range of backgrounds - found a range of issues increased levels of youth loneliness, particularly: The report - Lonliness Connects Us - says that \"loneliness itself is often a source of shame and stigma in a world which seems to require the performance of happiness and success\". 'I still feel very lonely'\nThe 20-year-old woman interviewed said: \"Old connections are broken. Who do you turn to? Not your family because you don't want to add to their sense of disappointment. \"Online, happiness is compulsory. Looking happy online with a drink in your hand. You can't say, 'This is really hard, and I'm missing you.' \"And sometimes, even when I've now done everything I was meant to do, and I've succeeded in school and pleased my family and gone to uni, and I still feel very unhappy and lonely\u2026 what now?\" A recurring theme in the research was the loneliness that stems from a fear of disappointing those who have invested their hopes in a young person, if the path of education or career \"success\" is not sustained. A 21-year-old man said: \"If you asked me what represents my feeling of loneliness most, it's when I've been in all weekend on my own and there's leftover pizza in the fridge at the end of the weekend, because I've ordered a pizza but I can't eat it all. \"I came here to go to university, but it didn't work out. I've left home and don't want to go back to the country town I come from, but I'm new here. Anyway, I've lost contact with my school friends. \"I don't have a steady job. I get bits and pieces as a freelancer. But at the moment I'm working at a call centre, where I have to put up with a lot of rudeness. \"It's all turned out so much harder than I expected, and I'm not making much money. I feel a failure at times, and I don't want my parents to know.\" And a 23-year-old man told researchers: \"I used to think that when I'm 30 I'll have the Mondeo, the house and all that stuff. But I'm getting older and I still don't know if I'll get that. \"I don't know what I'm doing yet. I don't have a career. I'm trying to find my path\u2026 I get anxiety about not spending my time wisely, not getting ahead. Why am I not building, being productive? Why I'm not getting on?\" The study found that social media \"presented a continued pressure to communicate oneself in a particular way, as leading an interesting and enviable life\". A 21-year-old woman told researchers: \"Social media is social pressure\u2026 people posting fake happiness. That has to be one of the loneliest places, with so much inner unhappiness and faking it online. \"So all your connections are based on falseness.\" The report says: \"Young people's exposure in schools to messages of empowerment, hard work, aspiration and resilience and the need to stand on their own two feet and look to themselves alone needs questioning. \"It has been clear throughout this period of research how powerful media discourses circulate that frame success and failure in achieving one's aspirations of wealth and happiness in terms of individual's effort rather than reflecting more complex classed and gendered explanations.\" Dr James Duggan, research fellow at MMU's school of childhood, youth and education studies, said discussions about loneliness in the past had tended to focus on older people. \"But there's an emerging debate on youth loneliness and we wanted to make sense of it and put young people's voices at the centre of those discussions. \"Young people should take practical and political action, and we're encouraging them to put loneliness on the agenda of youth politics.\" ",

        "content": "Kenya's president and opposition leader have promised to begin a process of reconciliation following last year's bitterly contested election. Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga spoke on national TV after holding their first public meeting since the poll. About 150 people were killed in the aftermath of the disputed election. Earlier this year, Mr Odinga swore himself in as the \"people's president\" and refused to recognise election winner Mr Kenyatta as head of state. Until now, both had dismissed calls for talks. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is due to arrive in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, later on Friday In their joint address, President Kenyatta referred to Mr Odinga as his \"brother\". Mr Kenyatta said: \"We will begin a process of discussing what ails us and what creates division amongst us.\" Mr Odinga said it was \"time to resolve our differences\". President Kenyatta was sworn in for a second term last November. He won an election re-run in October, which Mr Odinga had boycotted. Elections were first held in August but the courts ordered a re-run, saying Mr Kenyatta's victory was marred by irregularities. Mr Odinga said that nothing had been changed before the re-run. ",

They will include Royal Marines and military personnel who have specialist training in chemical warfare and decontamination, the BBC understands. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia collapsed on Sunday afternoon after being exposed to a nerve agent. Home Secretary Amber Rudd has described the attack as \"outrageous\". The BBC's Daniel Sandford said the military personnel were \"experts in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear warfare\". The Metropolitan Police said the counter-terrorism unit has requested the military's assistance \"to remove a number of vehicles and objects from the scene\", including ambulances that may have been contaminated while assisting the victims. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the military had stepped up to \"assist with this crucial inquiry\". The public should not be alarmed and there is no evidence to suggest a wide public health risk at this time, the police added. Mr Skripal, an ex-Russian military security colonel, and his daughter remain in a critical condition at Salisbury District Hospital. Specialist investigators wearing protective suits have been seen examining the bench that the pair collapsed on. Mr Skripal's house and his car have also been cordoned off. It is known that Mr Skripal and his daughter had visited the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found near the Maltings shopping centre. The graves of Mr Skripal's wife and son at a Salisbury cemetery have also been taped off. Mr Skripal, 66, was convicted by the Russian government of passing secrets to MI6, but given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a \"spy swap\". Police said 21 people had been seen for medical treatment in the aftermath of the incident, but only three people were being treated. Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust said a number of people were assessed but required no further treatment. Det Sgt Nick Bailey - who attended the scene on Sunday - is conscious but \"very anxious\" about being exposed to a nerve agent. Salisbury District Hospital's director of nursing Lorna Wilkinson said Mr Bailey was in a serious but stable condition. ",

The BBC's Daniel Sandford said the military personnel were \"experts in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear warfare\". The Metropolitan Police said the counter-terrorism unit has requested the military's assistance \"to remove a number of vehicles and objects from the scene\", including ambulances that may have been contaminated while assisting the victims.

Specialist investigators wearing protective suits have been seen examining the bench that the pair collapsed on. Mr Skripal's house and his car have also been cordoned off. It is known that Mr Skripal and his daughter had visited the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found near the Maltings shopping centre.

Mr Skripal, 66, was convicted by the Russian government of passing secrets to MI6, but given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a \"spy swap\". Police said 21 people had been seen for medical treatment in the aftermath of the incident, but only three people were being treated. Former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Blair said the \"extraordinary attack in Salisbury\" is a good reason to investigate whether there is a pattern of former British intelligence collaborators dying in the UK. The attempted murder of Mr Skripal has drawn comparisons to the 2006 assassination of Alexander Litvinenko, who ingested the rare and highly radioactive Polonium 210 in London. On Tuesday Labour MP Yvette Cooper asked the home secretary to review 14 other deaths that had not been treated as suspicious by UK police, but have reportedly been identified by US intelligence sources as being connected to the Russian state. Ms Rudd has refused to speculate on whether the Russian state might have been involved in the attack, saying the police investigation should be based on \"facts, not rumour\". ",

        "content": "A serial sex attacker dubbed the M25 rapist has died in prison. Antoni Imiela, 63, who preyed upon women and girls across south-east England, was given seven life terms in 2004. In January, it emerged he was being considered for release after serving a total of 14 years in jail. The Prison Service said Imiela, who is understood to have had a heart condition, died at HMP Wakefield on Thursday. There were no suspicious circumstances, it added. Imiela moved to Appledore, near Ashford in Kent, in 1996 after serving a prison sentence for a series of robberies. Five years later he began a campaign of attacks - raping three girls and four women in 2001 and 2002. The locations of his attacks, in Kent, Surrey, Hertfordshire and west London, earned him the M25 rapist moniker. Imiela's trial at Maidstone Crown Court in 2004 heard how he targeted strangers - dragging his victims into secluded areas where he threatened to kill them. In March 2004, Imiela was convicted of the seven rapes, along with the kidnap, indecent assault and attempted rape of a 10-year-old girl in Birmingham, leading to seven life sentences. Speaking in July 2004, one of his victims, who wished to remain anonymous, said he had raped her at knifepoint and punched her in the face when she tried to look at him. She said she finally regained a sense of control after looking Imiela in the eye in court. \"When I saw him... it just totally took that terror away. I just thought he looked pathetic,\" she told the BBC. Imiela was arrested on the M20 in 2002 after a neighbour contacted the BBC's Crimewatch programme saying he knew him \"by sight\", after a broadcast appeal for information. Speaking to the BBC after his conviction in 2004, Imiela's wife, Christine Imiela, said she still loved him, but described her husband as \"a sick man who needs help\". \"He had raped people and obviously been with prostitutes,\" she said. \"I cannot feel the same, but deep down I do still love him and I want to support him because I am sure he is ill. \"Anyone that is ill, I do not think they should just be discarded.\" Dragged off street\nWhile in prison, a cold case review took place into an attack in 1987 on a 31-year-old woman, which found a DNA match to Imiela. In 2012, he was sentenced to a further 12 years in prison after being found guilty of the attack. The jury was told he grabbed the woman off the street in Sydenham in south-east London, put his hand over her mouth, dragged her on to waste ground and sexually assaulted her, before threatening her with a brick. Sentencing Imiela, Judge John Bevan told him: \"You are wholly unrepentant about your life of guns, rape and general violence and, despite having served eight years of your life sentence, you have not expressed one jot of remorse.\" The victim died before her attacker was brought to justice. Speaking after the 2012 case, detectives said they believed it was likely Imiela had attacked further victims. A Prison Service spokeswoman said: \"As with all deaths in custody, there will be an independent investigation by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman.\" ",

        "content": "The UK will seek an exemption from President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to the US, according to Trade Secretary Liam Fox. Mr Fox says he will travel to Washington next week when he will discuss the new duties. He said: \"We will, of course, be looking to see how we can maximise the UK's case for exemption under these particular circumstances.\" Steel imports will carry a 25% tariff while aluminium will have a 10% duty. UK Steel says 7% of its steel exports go to the US, worth \u00a3360m. President Trump claims that the US has suffered from \"unfair trade\" and that the tariffs will boost the domestic market. Mr Fox said: \"We understand the anxieties about steel over-production that the United States has but we believe there are other ways to tackle that on a multilateral basis.\" Mr Trump's decision, which comes into effect in two weeks' time, has provoked widespread condemnation from the likes of China and France. It also prompted the resignation of Mr Trump's chief economic adviser Gary Cohn. 'Shooting itself in the foot'\nGareth Stace, director of UK Steel, said: \"Slapping a 25% tax on steel from British companies is going to hit us hard.\" He added: \"It worries me that I don't think the Trump administration has quantified what it can supply from its own market and what it can't. Therefore, it is actually shooting itself in the foot by increasing costs to the US steel sector and US manufacturing sector by 25%.\" You may also be interested in:\nA spokesman for steelmaker ArcelorMittal said the industry faced a number of problems: \"The steel industry has been characterised in recent years by overcapacity, high levels of imports and unfair trade. \"We have appreciated the efforts made by governments to address unfair imports in support of a level playing field. Fundamentally a solution must be found to address the high level of overcapacity that still exists. This is particularly important given steel's globally traded nature.\" 'Regrettable' move\nUK exports of aluminium to the US are tiny, but the UK's Aluminium Federation fears a trade war all the same. Aluminium Federation president Giles Ashmead said: \"The proposed 10% tariff on aluminium entering the US is regrettable. \"While the US is not a major export market for UK-produced aluminium, indiscriminate tariffs are a hindrance to free trade, and do little to secure a 'level playing field' for global commerce.\" Canada and Mexico will be exempt from the tariffs while negotiations continue over the North America Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). The final round of Nafta talks is due to be held this spring in the US. ",

        "content": "The US has expressed surprise at the \"dramatic\" shift in stance by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un that has seen President Donald Trump agree to talks. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said it would take \"some weeks\" to set up a meeting, due to take place by May. Mr Trump hailed \"great progress\" but said sanctions would remain in place. South Korean envoys had earlier briefed Mr Trump on the meeting they had this week with Mr Kim, saying he was now \"committed to denuclearisation\". South Korea's President Moon Jae-in said the news of the Kim-Trump meeting had come \"like a miracle\". \"If President Trump and Chairman Kim meet following an inter-Korean summit, complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula will be put on the right track in earnest,\" he said. China has welcomed the development, saying the Korean peninsula issue was \"heading in the right direction\" and calling for \"political courage\". However, correspondents say the North has halted missile and nuclear tests during previous talks, only to resume them when it lost patience or felt it was not getting what it demanded. What's the latest from the US?\nMr Tillerson spoke about the developments while in Djibouti on an African trip. He said of Kim Jong-un: \"What changed was his posture in a fairly dramatic way. \"In all honesty, that came as a little bit of a surprise to us, as well that he was so forward-leaning in his conversations with the delegation from South Korea.\" In recent months, Mr Trump has belittled Mr Kim as the \"rocket man\", threatening him with \"fire and fury\", while Mr Kim has called Mr Trump \"a mentally deranged US dotard\". Mr Tillerson said Mr Trump had been open to talks \"when the time was right\", adding: \"In the president's judgment, that time has arrived now.\" Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze. Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being planned! End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump The secretary of state also drew a line between what constituted \"talks\" and \"negotiations\", although he did not specify the difference. Just a day earlier, he had said the US was \"a long way\" from negotiations with the North, leading some commentators to suggest Mr Tillerson was out of the loop. But Mr Tillerson said he had had a \"very good conversation\" with the president early on Friday morning. Moon's huge gamble\nAnalysis by BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul President Moon Jae-in has acknowledged there are obstacles ahead. He is managing expectations and so much can go wrong. His approval ratings took a hit during the Winter Olympics after he integrated the women's hockey team with players from the North and met a general from Pyongyang who had been accused of masterminding deadly attacks on South Koreans, though they have since rebounded. These talks are a huge gamble with a communist state which is hard to read. But if, just if, he helps pull it off, it may reduce the threat of nuclear war and he could win himself a Nobel Peace prize. If all fails, it is back to brinkmanship. Read Laura's piece in full How did we reach this point?\nThe South Korean envoys met Mr Kim in Pyongyang this week. It was the culmination of a rapprochement that began at the New Year and led to the Koreas marching together at the Winter Olympics. The envoys then travelled to Washington to brief Mr Trump. Speaking outside the White House after the meeting, South Korean National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong said that: In a statement sent to the Washington Post, North Korea's UN ambassador said the \"courageous decision\" of Mr Kim would help secure \"peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and the East Asia region\". There is no indication yet of where the Trump-Kim talks might take place, but the Korean border's demilitarised zone (DMZ) and Beijing are seen as likely options. What could be on the agenda?\nClearly for the US, South Korea and allied nations, denuclearisation is the key issue. North Korea has been isolated for decades because of its pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws. The North has carried out six nuclear tests and has missiles that could reach the US. However, the BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says it is important to note that North Korea has not yet promised to abandon its nuclear weapons completely. The North's well-documented human rights abuses are also a key issue for the US. So what does the North want? An easing, if not removal, of sanctions certainly. A former British ambassador to North Korea, John Everard, told the BBC there must be a suspicion that Mr Kim might be trying to play Mr Trump to try to \"get him to say across the table things that North Korea has been asking for for a long time\". These could include a peace treaty to finally end the Korean War and a promise that if North Korea denuclearised then the US would finally withdraw its troops from South Korea. The US has tens of thousands of military personnel there and the massive annual joint war games infuriate the North because it believes they are preparation for invasion. What have the other players said?\nThe reaction has been positive, if cautious among some: Have talks like this happened in the past?\nNo sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader, but there have been repeated attempts to get North Korea to denuclearise. The last major effort - the Six Party talks - collapsed in 2008, largely because North Korea refused to allow inspectors to verify that it had shut down its nuclear programme. A number of bids to restart the talks after that also collapsed. ",

        "content": "A study of 126,000 rumours and false news stories spread on Twitter over a period of 11 years found that they travelled faster and reached more people than the truth. Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology also found that fake news was more commonly re-tweeted by humans than bots. They said it could be because fake news tends to be \"more novel\". The most common subject matter was false political news. Other popular topics included urban legends, business, terrorism, science, entertainment and natural disasters. Twitter provided its data for the research. The firm told the BBC that it is already engaged with trying to devise a \"health check\" to measure its contribution to public conversation. \"False news is more novel, and people are more likely to share novel information,\" said Professor Sinan Aral, one of the study's co-authors. While the team did not conclude that novelty on its own caused the re-tweets, they said false news tended to be more surprising than real news, which may make it more likely to be shared. Prof Aral, Soroush Vosoughi and associate professor Deb Roy began their research in the aftermath of the Boston marathon bombing in 2013. \"Twitter became our main source of news,\" said Dr Vosoughi. \"I realized that \u2026 a good chunk of what I was reading on social media was rumours; it was false news.\" The team used six independent fact-checking sources, including Snopes and Urbanlegend, to identify whether the stories in the study were genuine. Their findings, published in the journal Science, included: Best gossip\nPsychology Prof Geoffrey Beattie from Edge Hill University in Lancashire, told the BBC there is a position of power associated with being someone who shares information that others have not heard before - regardless of whether or not it is true. \"People want to share information that is newsworthy - in some sense the truth value is less of a concern,\" he said. He compared the spread of fake news with the sharing of gossip. \"The point about gossip is, the best gossip is juicy gossip - the last thing people are worried about is whether it is true or not,\" he said. \"It's whether it is plausible or not. \"We are saturated with news, so things have to be more and more surprising, or disgusting, to get attention.\" ",

        "content": "The bomb left on a London Tube train at Parsons Green contained 400g of an explosive that with just one gram could cause \"serious injury\", a court heard. The device partially detonated on a District Line train on 15 September 2017, injuring many of the 93 passengers on board. Prosecutors say Ahmed Hassan built the bomb and set the timer, before leaving it on the train one stop earlier. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. Explosives expert Sarah Wilson said, had the device fully detonated, it had the potential to be \"lethal\". 'Unstable and unpredictable'\nMs Wilson was the first to give evidence at the Old Bailey on Friday. She told the court that tests on the remains of the device showed the explosive TATP had been used. The jury heard how just one gram of the chemical compound could cause \"serious injury to people or property\", but that the device had contained around 400g, along with 2.2kg of shrapnel to cause further damage. Ms Wilson described TATP as a \"sensitive primary high explosive\" which is \"very unstable and unpredictable\" - so is not produced for commercial or military use - and the bomb could be detonated just by being dropped. It would have taken several hours to create that amount of the substance, she said, along with the small amount that was discovered at Mr Hassan's foster home in Sudbury, Surrey. 'Rapid burn'\nMs Wilson said all the elements necessary for making the bomb were there, but there could have been \"a number of factors\" around why it did not work properly, including whether it was made correctly or if it had become wet. She said: \"My conclusion was there had been a partial explosion. Obviously this device had not fully detonated but something quite violent happened. \"It was likely to be a rapid burn rather than a detonation. \"The initiator mechanism, the battery, has functioned but the main charge had failed to function fully.\" 'Trained to kill'\nOn Thursday, the court heard from a number of witnesses to the explosion who described a \"rolling fireball\" coming towards them. The jury also heard about injuries to some of the passengers, including hair being set on fire and clothes melting, after the device partially detonated. On Wednesday, the prosecution also said that Mr Hassan had told Home Office officials, 20 months before the Parsons Green attack, that he had been \"trained to kill\".

They will include Royal Marines and military personnel who have specialist training in chemical warfare and decontamination, the BBC understands. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia collapsed on Sunday afternoon after being exposed to a nerve agent. Home Secretary Amber Rudd has described the attack as \"outrageous\". The BBC's Daniel Sandford said the military personnel were \"experts in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear warfare\". The Metropolitan Police said the counter-terrorism unit has requested the military's assistance \"to remove a number of vehicles and objects from the scene\", including ambulances that may have been contaminated while assisting the victims. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the military had stepped up to \"assist with this crucial inquiry\". The public should not be alarmed and there is no evidence to suggest a wide public health risk at this time, the police added. Mr Skripal, an ex-Russian military security colonel, and his daughter remain in a critical condition at Salisbury District Hospital. Det Sgt Nick Bailey - who attended the scene on Sunday - is conscious but \"very anxious\" about being exposed to a nerve agent. Director of nursing Lorna Wilkinson said Mr Bailey was in a serious but stable condition. Specialist investigators wearing protective suits have been seen examining the bench that Mr Skripal and his daughter collapsed on. Mr Skripal's house and his car have also been cordoned off. It is known that Mr Skripal and his daughter had visited the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found near the Maltings shopping centre. Ms Rudd visited some of the sights cordoned off by counter-terrorism police in Salisbury on Friday. She also visited Salisbury District Hospital where Mr Skripal, his daughter, and Mr Bailey are being treated. The graves of Mr Skripal's wife and son at a Salisbury cemetery have also been taped off. Mr Skripal, 66, was convicted by the Russian government of passing secrets to MI6, but given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a \"spy swap\". Former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Blair said the \"extraordinary attack in Salisbury\" is a good reason to investigate whether there is a pattern of former British intelligence collaborators dying in the UK. Former First Sea Lord and security minister Lord West said: \"If it is a nation which has done it, it is completely unacceptable. It's almost like an act of war. \"To actually allow something like a nerve agent to be used in another country for some reason is outrageous.\" Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has denied his country's involvement in the attempted murder of the ex-spy. The attempted murder of Mr Skripal has drawn comparisons to the 2006 assassination of Alexander Litvinenko, who ingested the rare and highly radioactive Polonium 210 in London. On Tuesday Labour MP Yvette Cooper asked the home secretary to review 14 other deaths that had not been treated as suspicious by UK police, but have reportedly been identified by US intelligence sources as being connected to the Russian state. Ms Rudd has refused to speculate on whether the Russian state might have been involved in the attack, saying the police investigation should be based on \"facts, not rumour\". ",

        "content": "The bomb left on a London Tube train at Parsons Green contained 400g of an explosive that with just one gram could cause \"serious injury\", a court heard. The device partially detonated on a District Line train on 15 September 2017, injuring many of the 93 passengers on board. Prosecutors say Ahmed Hassan built the bomb and set the timer, before leaving it on the train one stop earlier. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. Explosives expert Sarah Wilson said, had the device fully detonated, it had the potential to be \"lethal\". 'Unstable and unpredictable'\nMs Wilson was the first to give evidence at the Old Bailey on Friday. She told the court that tests on the remains of the device showed the explosive TATP had been used. The jury heard how just one gram of the chemical compound could cause \"serious injury to people or property\", but that the device had contained around 400g, along with 2.2kg of shrapnel to cause further damage. Ms Wilson described TATP as a \"sensitive primary high explosive\" which is \"very unstable and unpredictable\" - so is not produced for commercial or military use - and the bomb could be detonated just by being dropped. It would have taken several hours to create that amount of the substance, she said, along with the small amount that was discovered at Mr Hassan's foster home in Sudbury, Surrey. 'Rapid burn'\nMs Wilson said all the elements necessary for making the bomb were there, but there could have been \"a number of factors\" around why it did not work properly, including whether it was made correctly or if it had become wet. She said: \"My conclusion was there had been a partial explosion. Obviously this device had not fully detonated but something quite violent happened. \"It was likely to be a rapid burn rather than a detonation. \"The initiator mechanism, the battery, has functioned but the main charge had failed to function fully.\" 'Trained to kill'\nOn Thursday, the court heard from a number of witnesses to the explosion who described a \"rolling fireball\" coming towards them.

        "content": "Kenya's president and opposition leader have promised to begin a process of reconciliation following last year's bitterly contested election. Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga spoke on national TV after holding their first public meeting since the poll. About 150 people were killed in the aftermath of the disputed election. Earlier this year, Mr Odinga swore himself in as the \"people's president\" and refused to recognise election winner Mr Kenyatta as head of state. Until now, both had dismissed calls for talks. In their joint address, President Kenyatta referred to Mr Odinga as his \"brother\". Mr Kenyatta said: \"We will begin a process of discussing what ails us and what creates division amongst us.\" Mr Odinga said it was \"time to resolve our differences\". Pre-emptive PR stunt?\nAnalysis by Ferdinand Ferdinand Omondi, BBC Africa, Nairobi Resolving the two men's differences won't be so easy. Kenya is sharply divided along ethnic lines because of the political stand-off. The opposition charges of rigged elections, police brutality and state high-handedness were not mentioned - only a joint call for national dialogue. The unexpected public appearance comes as US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visits Kenya as part of his visit to Africa. In Ethiopia, he criticised the government for declaring a state of emergency. So some see this meeting as a pre-emptive public relations stunt to water down any potential dressing-down; while others have welcomed the announcement as long overdue. Whichever explanation rings true, Kenya is headed for an intriguing second episode of political drama. President Kenyatta was sworn in for a second term last November. He won an election re-run in October, which Mr Odinga had boycotted. Elections were first held in August but the courts ordered a re-run, saying Mr Kenyatta's victory was marred by irregularities. Mr Odinga said that nothing had been changed before the re-run. ",

Shami was dropped from a list of contracted players for the national team announced by the Board of Control for Cricket in India on 8 January. Police say the charges against the 27-year-old fast bowler include domestic violence, rape, attempted murder and criminal intimidation. Shami has represented India 87 times in all formats of the game since 2012. The charges against the player carry prison terms of 10 years or more. He has denied his wife Hasin Jahan's claims, who first accused him of adultery, making public a series of messages that Shami allegedly sent to women during their four-year marriage. \"It's definitely a part of a big conspiracy against me,\" said Shami, 27, who has won 30 Test caps. A BCCI supervisory committee said the allegations had put them in a difficult position. \"We are in a bit of Catch 22,\" Vinod Rai, chairman of the committee, told cricket website ESPNcricinfo. \"Ordinarily you would distinguish and say that is a personal issue and the contract is a professional issue. \"But someone could easily point out and say this allegation is an unsavoury one and you are still rewarding him.\" Ms Jahan also filed a rape complaint against Shami's elder brother.

        "content": "England head coach Eddie Jones' decision to pick the same back row that faced Scotland when they meet France has been described as \"funny and amazing\" by former flanker Serge Betsen. England conceded nine turnovers at the breakdown as they lost 25-13 to Scotland in their previous Six Nations outing. Jones has kept faith with Courtney Lawes, Chris Robshaw and Nathan Hughes for the trip to the Stade de France in Paris on Saturday. \"It's really funny Jones has challenged the back row to beat France with that style of play,\" Betsen, who won 63 caps for France between 1997 and 2007, told BBC Sport. \"France will target the breakdown and are going to follow what Scotland managed to do against England. \"In the back row England have got some second rows who maybe have less speed and who are really tall. It's a handicap for them in that aspect of the game. \"The French forwards are really effective in that area and especially a player like [prop] Jefferson Poirot. \"Wenceslas Lauret and Yacouba Camara are experts in the back row and Marco Tauleigne will bring a lot of dynamism in open play.\" What is the breakdown?\nThe breakdown is the period between open play and the formation of a ruck where players compete for possession. Once a ruck has formed, no player may handle the ball. Robshaw was the only one of the three to claim a turnover against Scotland, with fellow flanker Lawes conceding three. Over the first three rounds of the 2018 tournament, England have the worst success rate of all the Six Nations sides at the ruck. \"At the moment, with the players we have available, this is the best back row we have,\" Jones told BBC Radio 5 live. \"Technically we got the breakdown wrong against Scotland and they were much better than us in that area, but we'll get it right for France. \"We didn't adjust to the referee's interpretations, which is disappointing and something we can learn from.\" England will face a France side buoyed by the return to form of centre Mathieu Bastareaud. At over 19st, he is the heaviest back in this year's Championship, but he won a game-high four turnovers in the 34-17 win over Italy in Paris. Bastareaud made a rampant return to midfield against the Azzurri - his first Six Nations appearance since 2015 - setting up one try and scoring another. The 29-year-old, who has won 43 caps, spent more than two years out of the international set-up between 2015 and 2017. He also missed the opening two rounds of this year's tournament after being banned for three weeks a for a homophobic slur. \"The way he played against Italy, you could see he'd had to wait for that,\" Toulon team-mate and England wing Chris Ashton told Matt Dawson's Rugby Show. \"He had to wait some time to get back in and get a starting place. He took his chance and played unbelievably well.\" Bastareaud's expertise at the breakdown is another element England must contain if they are to keep their hopes of a third successive Six Nations title alive on Saturday. \"The only way you can target Bastareaud is by making the game fast,\" said Ashton. \"If they manage to do that then I think there could be areas in and around the whole French team.\" Asked about Bastareaud's personality off the pitch, Ashton said: \"He's quite quiet day to day. He picks his moments when he's lively and he's well respected in the team. \"This season he's been our captain and done a good job for us. \"He rides a small moped to training and everybody that sees him on it waves to him. It's almost like Rocky going through the streets from the film.\" ",

        "content": "About 180 military personnel have been deployed to Salisbury to help in the investigation into the attempted murder of an ex-Russian spy and his daughter. They will include Royal Marines and military personnel who have specialist training in chemical warfare and decontamination, the BBC understands. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia collapsed on Sunday afternoon after being exposed to a nerve agent. Home Secretary Amber Rudd has described the attack as \"outrageous\". The BBC's Daniel Sandford said the military personnel were \"experts in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear warfare\". The Metropolitan Police said the counter-terrorism unit has requested the military's assistance \"to remove a number of vehicles and objects from the scene\", including ambulances that may have been contaminated while assisting the victims. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the military had stepped up to \"assist with this crucial inquiry\". The public should not be alarmed and there is no evidence to suggest a wide public health risk at this time, the police added. Mr Skripal, an ex-Russian military security colonel, and his daughter remain in a critical condition at Salisbury District Hospital. Det Sgt Nick Bailey - who attended the scene on Sunday - is conscious but \"very anxious\" about being exposed to a nerve agent. Director of nursing Lorna Wilkinson said Mr Bailey was in a serious but stable condition. Specialist investigators wearing protective suits have been seen examining the bench that Mr Skripal and his daughter collapsed on. Mr Skripal's house and his car have also been cordoned off. It is known that Mr Skripal and his daughter had visited the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found near the Maltings shopping centre. Ms Rudd visited some of the sights cordoned off by counter-terrorism police in Salisbury on Friday. She also visited Salisbury District Hospital where Mr Skripal, his daughter, and Mr Bailey are being treated. The home secretary, who met Mr Bailey in hospital, would not give any further details of the nerve agent used or how it was administered. The graves of Mr Skripal's wife and son at a Salisbury cemetery have also been taped off. Mr Skripal, 66, was convicted by the Russian government of passing secrets to MI6, but given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a \"spy swap\". Former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Blair said the \"extraordinary attack in Salisbury\" is a good reason to investigate whether there is a pattern of former British intelligence collaborators dying in the UK. Former First Sea Lord and security minister Lord West said: \"If it is a nation which has done it, it is completely unacceptable. It's almost like an act of war. \"To actually allow something like a nerve agent to be used in another country for some reason is outrageous.\" Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has denied his country's involvement in the attempted murder of the ex-spy. The attempted murder of Mr Skripal has drawn comparisons to the 2006 assassination of Alexander Litvinenko, who ingested the rare and highly radioactive Polonium 210 in London. On Tuesday Labour MP Yvette Cooper asked the home secretary to review 14 other deaths that had not been treated as suspicious by UK police, but have reportedly been identified by US intelligence sources as being connected to the Russian state. Ms Rudd has refused to speculate on whether the Russian state might have been involved in the attack, saying the police investigation should be based on \"facts, not rumour\". ",

        "content": "Four-time Tour de France champion Chris Froome says he completely backs Sir Dave Brailsford staying on as Team Sky principal after he was criticised in an MPs' report. A select committee report published this week said Team Sky \"crossed an ethical line\" by using drugs to \"enhance the performance of riders\" instead of for solely medical need. It said Brailsford must \"take responsibility for these failures\". Asked if he completely backs Brailsford remaining in his role, Froome told BBC Sport: \"Yes I do.\" Froome, 32, is competing at the Tirreno-Adriatico stage race in Italy, his second event since his adverse drugs test was made public in December. Speaking before the start of stage three in Follonica on Friday, Froome said Team Sky had \"evolved\" since its early years that are the focus of the report. \"From the conception of the team back in 2010, there have been a lot of things that have changed, a lot of procedures and checks that have been put in place since then,\" said Froome. Media playback is not supported on this device Monday's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) report said Team Sky used the anti-inflammatory drug triamcinolone to prepare Britain's most decorated Olympian Sir Bradley Wiggins and a smaller group of riders for the Tour de France, which Wiggins won in 2012. Asthmatic Wiggins was granted therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) to take the corticosteroid, which can treat allergies and respiratory issues, shortly before the 2011 Tour de France, his 2012 Tour win and the 2013 Giro d'Italia. Team Sky \"strongly refute\" the allegation and Wiggins told the BBC he is \"100%\" not a cheat. The report said Brailsford must also take responsibility for \"the damaging scepticism about the legitimacy of his team's performance and accomplishments\". Brailsford is not with either of the Sky teams at Tirreno-Adriatico or Paris-Nice in France, two of the most prestigious early-season stage races. Media playback is not supported on this device UCI president David Lappartient told BBC Sport on Wednesday \"it would have been better\" for Froome not to ride while he explains to cycling's world governing body how he returned double the allowed level of legal asthma drug salbutamol in his urine during his Vuelta a Espana victory in September 2017. On Thursday, Froome reiterated his intention to ride the Giro d'Italia, which starts on 4 May. \"The first big goal for me this year is the Giro. I'm well on track for that but I'm still not at my best yet,\" he said. Lappartient said a decision on Froome's case was unlikely before the Giro starts but that it would be a \"disaster for the image of cycling\" if the Briton rode the Tour in July with the case still unresolved. \"Given his concern for the reputation of the sport, it would be more sensible of him to raise his concerns in person or at least though the right channels as opposed to through the media,\" Froome told Cycling News on Thursday. Froome opted against taking a voluntary suspension when he was told of his adverse finding in September 2017. At his first race of the season, the Ruta del Sol in Spain in February, he said he case is \"not going to go any faster if I was sitting at home\". At Tirreno-Adriatico, Froome said his understanding of World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) rules was that any results achieved between the Vuelta and the date of a verdict in his case would stand. It means Froome could race and win the Giro and the Tour but not be stripped of the titles if he were to receive a ban, as it would start from the date of the verdict. Any suspension would see Froome stripped of his Vuelta title, given the adverse test was returned during the race, which ran from 19 August to 10 September. Froome won team and individual time trial bronze at the World Championships in Norway later in September. Media playback is not supported on this device ",

Forty-eight different nations, plus a national Paralympic athletes team consisting of Russian competitors, entered the stadium in -5C temperatures. A record 567 athletes will take part across nine days of competition. Snowboarder Owen Pick led the British team into the arena as flagbearer. ParalympicsGB has sent a 17-strong team of athletes, though only snowboarders Pick, Ben Moore and James Barnes-Miller, and 2014 gold-medal-winning visually impaired skier Kelly Gallagher and her guide Gary Smith attended the ceremony, with the remaining athletes competing on Saturday The $106m 35,000-seater stadium, which will be pulled down after the closing ceremony, appeared to be about two thirds full, and the crowd watched a ceremony consisting of traditional Korean dance, combined with modern music and blended with light shows. Media playback is not supported on this device There will be 80 medals awarded in six sports - alpine skiing, snowboarding, Para-ice hockey, wheelchair curling and the nordic skiing disciplines of cross country and biathlon. Pope Francis has sent his greetings to the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and all the Para-athletes competing. \"Sport can build bridges between countries in conflict, giving a valid contribution and perspectives for peace among people,\" he said. Three countries will be making their first Winter Paralympic appearance in South Korea. North Korea are one - they have two athletes in the cross country skiing. Unlike in the Olympics, where North and South Korean athletes marched at the opening ceremony under a unified flag, the two nations will remain separate for the Paralympics ceremony. Georgia and Tajikistan are also making their Winter Games debuts, while the USA will have the largest team - 68 athletes. This is the 12th Winter Paralympics. Sixteen nations took part in the first one in Ornskoldsvik, Sweden, in 1976. The previous biggest Paralympic Winter Games in terms of athlete numbers were held in Nagano, Japan, in 1998 when 562 athletes took part. At Sochi 2014, 550 were involved. The sporting action will begin with the men's and women's downhill skiing events from 00:30 GMT on Saturday with the closing ceremony on 18 March. ",

        "content": "For a couple of weeks every month, Lucie seemed to become a different person - one suffering from countless mental and physical problems - and she couldn't understand why. She spent years looking for a doctor who could provide an answer, and it took a hysterectomy at the age of 28 to cure her. \"I would know that things would change before I even opened my eyes in the morning. It was just like this weight had been put on me,\" says Lucie. \"I did go to the doctor at one point and tell them that I thought I was possessed.\" Before puberty hit, Lucie had been a calm, happy, carefree child. But from the age of 13 she started to suffer from severe depression, anxiety and panic attacks. She also began to self-harm, and experienced extreme mood swings. So at 14, she was pulled out of her mainstream school and sent to live in an adolescent mental health unit. \"I had a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), and they mentioned bipolar quite a lot,\" she recalls. But none of these seemed to fit the cyclical nature of her symptoms. Things changed dramatically when she became pregnant at 16 with her son, Toby. \"Within a few months of being pregnant I left the hospital. My symptoms just seemed to disappear. I was happy. I felt really good. I felt mentally really, really well, which was a surprise.\" This lasted throughout her pregnancy and her time breastfeeding - but when her periods came back, so did her symptoms. A few years later, Lucie, from Devon, went back to college to study for A levels, but every few weeks she would feel unable to cope with the pressure, and eventually she quit. Then she embarked on a National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) to become a teaching assistant. This time she struggled through to the final stretch, stopping only two months before the end, when her symptoms became unbearable. But at 23 Lucie became pregnant again - with her daughter Bella. And again she felt mentally well, despite having to spend months in hospital with severe vomiting. After Bella was born, however, the symptoms she had been struggling with for years became even worse. Some were physical - joint and muscle pain, hypersensitivity to sounds, smell and touch, and extreme fatigue. Others were mental - invasive thoughts, irrational behaviour, forgetfulness, and overwhelming feelings of hopelessness. \"The scariest thing for me was depersonalisation, where I would feel like I was completely disconnected from my body, and like I was in a dream. At points I would find that I didn't recognise the people that were around me. I knew that I should know them, but their faces just didn't make any sense to me,\" she remembers. \"And at one point, when things were really really bad, I could hear my voice as someone else's, so when I was talking, I couldn't recognise my own voice or my own reflection.\" She frequently suffered from suicidal thoughts, which led her to take enormous risks, almost willing her own death. All these things occurred at monthly intervals, but it wasn't until her husband, Martin, offhandedly mentioned that he should keep quiet before her period, so as not to annoy her, that Lucie began to study the connection between her periods and her symptoms. \"It became pretty clear what was going on,\" she says. \"Within hours of bleeding, I would be fine. I would go from one extreme to the other. I would know that my period was coming and though I suffered from really, really heavy, awful periods, I felt at my best when I was bleeding. I even very carefully planned my wedding day so I would be bleeding because I knew that it was the only time I felt OK.\" Up to this point, Lucie had always assumed that her hormones exacerbated the mental health problems she had been diagnosed with. Now she began to wonder if they could be the cause. Armed with a list of about 30 symptoms and information she had printed off the internet, Lucie went to speak to her GP. At the time, she was consistently being told that she was suffering from post-natal depression after the birth of her daughter, but having suffered from depression in the past, Lucie strongly believed this wasn't the case. She had been medicated with anti-depressants, anti-anxiety medications and sleeping pills since she was a teenager. And now anti-psychotics were added to the mix. \"Every time I went, they would up something or add something. I was on a very hefty dose of anti-depressants. And I would say to them, 'I'm not depressed\u2026 this isn't depression, something else is happening.' I felt like I was losing my mind completely.\" Her GP sent her to see a mental health team, who told her that although some of her symptoms were affecting her mental health, she had a physical condition that could not be treated by a psychiatrist. But when Lucie asked her GP if she could see a gynaecologist, he scoffed at the idea and sent her back to the mental health team. This time they gave Lucie's condition a name: Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) - a severe form of Premenstrual syndrome (PMS). They wrote to the GP recommending that she be seen by a gynaecologist, and \"think about medication to prevent ovulation permanently\". This seemed like a possible breakthrough to Lucie, but her GP disagreed with the diagnosis - and insisted that she try every possible alternative treatment before he would refer her. What is PMDD?\nSource: Nick Panay and Anna Fenton She was put on various birth control pills, which made her feel constantly ill, and once the dosage limit was reached for one anti-depressant, another one was added on top. She was prescribed Mirtazapine, Sertraline, Prozac, Diazepam and sleeping tablets, all of which made her feel numb, and made it harder for her to argue her case. \"It was very difficult. I was at my worst, I couldn't go to the doctors, couldn't even string a sentence together. I couldn't hold a conversation. And then when I was well, I couldn't even remember what I had been like, the weeks prior to that would just be a blur.\" It was Lucie's husband, Martin, who ensured that she kept going back to see her doctor, and trying other GPs, in the hope of finding one that would listen to her. Eventually, she met one who recognised that none of her treatments had worked, and at long last referred her to a gynaecologist. The appointment took place almost a year after her diagnosis of PMDD and she was immediately offered injections, taken every four weeks, which would stop the production of oestrogen in her body, causing her to go into a temporary menopause. If these injections worked, it would confirm her diagnosis of PMDD. The first two weeks were incredibly difficult, with the worst of Lucie's symptoms flaring up constantly. But after that, as she was bracing for her monthly onslaught to begin, nothing happened, and she felt truly well for the first time in over a decade. \"Suddenly, everything changed\u2026 all my symptoms vanished,\" she says. \"I didn't realise how bad I was until they disappeared.\" Within two months, miraculously, she was able to come off all the medication that she'd been on since her teens. Find out more\nAt her first follow-up appointment, five months after the injections had begun, her PMDD diagnosis was confirmed. And a new, more permanent, idea was raised - a hysterectomy, the surgical removal of Lucie's uterus. Prior to this, Lucie had been 100% certain that she wanted another child, but she quickly found her conviction wavering. \"It was really important to me but then I knew that would mean coming off this injection, letting my periods come back in, and everything that came with that - and it was just an impossible task,\" she says. \"I didn't think I would make it if I did that. I thought I'd end up suicidal again, doing ridiculous risky things. It was just a scary feeling.\" When Lucie discussed the possibility of a hysterectomy with Martin, he was supportive, but concerned that she might come to regret the decision - which would not only rule out any more children, but make Lucie's temporary menopause permanent. Lucie says she was worried about that too. But then they sat down to write a list of symptoms she had previously suffered from - and this time came up with a total of 42. \"Looking back over that list, there was just no way I could survive that again, knowing what life was supposed to be like, knowing what normal was,\" she says. \"I hadn't known what normal was until now. Martin had seen the change in me and our lives. It was so much better.\" As Lucie was coming to terms with the idea of having a hysterectomy, though, she experienced a nasty shock - her symptoms started to reappear. \"The symptoms were just creeping back bit by bit, which was scary, and I started feeling suicidal again. I was so desperate for the injections. I knew that they had helped but suddenly they weren't working, and I was trying to get them earlier and earlier every month. It was really like being addicted,\" she says. Lucie's gynaecologist then told her it wasn't possible that the injections were wearing off, and that her diagnosis of PMDD must have been inaccurate. She was told to stop taking the injections and go back to using birth control to help manage her hormones. \"I was thinking that I couldn't do that. I would rather die than go back to what I had been like before,\" she says. Help and support\nThe nurse that had been giving her injections for months recommended yet another GP, and this one agreed to Lucie's request to be referred to a specialist unit that she'd read about, at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London. A few months later, Lucie walked into the clinic and told her full story, going back nearly 15 years. When she mentioned that the injections had been wearing off, the doctor replied that this was, in fact, pretty common. That validation was a huge relief. She was offered an injection taken every 10 weeks instead of four, and for a while it worked so well that it seemed there would be no need for a hysterectomy. But then Lucie started suffering from a new problem brought on by the temporary menopause she had undergone - a loss of bone density that often leads to osteoporosis. She was prescribed Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) to counteract this but it made her extremely unwell. This made up Lucie's mind and in December 2016, at the age of 28, she had a hysterectomy. Up until the day of her surgery she found herself questioning whether this was the right decision. But in the year since the operation, despite occasional migraines, she has been able to do more than in the 10 years before it. She has finished her NVQ and is now working as a teaching assistant, doing the very job she never thought she would be well enough to do. \"I still haven't quite got my head around the fact that this is how it is always going to be,\" she says. Lucie doesn't feel bitter about the time it took for her to get a diagnosis. \"I got there in the end. I just feel lucky that it was something that could be cured and that I did get to see the best people. I know that when I was younger, the symptoms were all because of PMDD - I have no doubts about that whatsoever - but it just wasn't recognised then like it is now. \"It was just shrugged off as, 'Oh no you know everybody gets PMS. Everybody feels like that sometimes,' and that's not the case.\" She does wish, though, that she'd been taken more seriously by her doctors after the birth of her daughter, when her symptoms were at their most severe. \"I wish I'd been listened to more, really. I just wish they'd taken into account what I was saying. If you're feeling like I was feeling, something is quite badly wrong.\" The surgery has affected not only Lucie, but all those around her. Martin, a musician, is able to spend more time working, because Lucie can now take responsibility for the children. Toby is old enough to appreciate the positive change in his mother; Lucie hopes that Bella does not remember her the way she was before her treatment for PMDD began. They are now so much happier as a family. \"Is this what everyone else is like all the time? They don't know how lucky they are,\" Lucie says. \"And it's nothing I'll ever ever take for granted.\" Follow Natasha Lipman on Twitter @natashalipman Join the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter ",

Det Sgt Nick Bailey - who attended the scene on Sunday - is conscious but \"very anxious\" about being exposed to a nerve agent. Director of nursing Lorna Wilkinson said Mr Bailey was in a serious but stable condition. Specialist investigators wearing protective suits have been seen examining the bench that Mr Skripal and his daughter collapsed on. Mr Skripal's house and his car have also been cordoned off. It is known that Mr Skripal and his daughter had visited the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found near the Maltings shopping centre. Ms Rudd visited some of the sites cordoned off by counter-terrorism police in Salisbury on Friday. She also visited Salisbury District Hospital where Mr Skripal, his daughter, and Mr Bailey are being treated. The home secretary, who met Mr Bailey in hospital, would not give any further details of the nerve agent used or how it was administered. The graves of Mr Skripal's wife and son at a Salisbury cemetery have also been taped off. Mr Skripal, 66, was convicted by the Russian government of passing secrets to MI6, but given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a \"spy swap\". Former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Blair said the \"extraordinary attack in Salisbury\" is a good reason to investigate whether there is a pattern of former British intelligence collaborators dying in the UK. Former First Sea Lord and security minister Lord West said: \"If it is a nation which has done it, it is completely unacceptable. It's almost like an act of war. \"To actually allow something like a nerve agent to be used in another country for some reason is outrageous.\" Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has denied his country's involvement in the attempted murder of the ex-spy. The attempted murder of Mr Skripal has drawn comparisons to the 2006 assassination of Alexander Litvinenko, who ingested the rare and highly radioactive Polonium 210 in London. On Tuesday Labour MP Yvette Cooper asked the home secretary to review 14 other deaths that had not been treated as suspicious by UK police, but have reportedly been identified by US intelligence sources as being connected to the Russian state. Ms Rudd has refused to speculate on whether the Russian state might have been involved in the attack, saying the police investigation should be based on \"facts, not rumour\". ",

        "content": "The bomb left on a London Tube train at Parsons Green contained 400g of an explosive that with just one gram could cause \"serious injury\", a court heard. The device partially detonated on a District Line train on 15 September 2017, injuring many of the 93 passengers on board. Prosecutors say Ahmed Hassan built the bomb and set the timer, before leaving it on the train one stop earlier. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. Explosives expert Sarah Wilson said, had the device fully detonated, it had the potential to be \"lethal\". 'Unstable and unpredictable'\nMs Wilson was the first to give evidence at the Old Bailey on Friday. She told the court that tests on the remains of the device showed the explosive chemical compound TATP had been used. The jury heard how just one gram of the chemical compound could cause \"serious injury to people or property\", but that the device had contained around 400g, along with 2.2kg of shrapnel to cause further damage. Ms Wilson described TATP as a \"sensitive primary high explosive\" which is \"very unstable and unpredictable\" - so is not produced for commercial or military use - and the bomb could be detonated just by being dropped. It would have taken several hours to create that amount of the substance, she said, along with the small amount that was discovered at Mr Hassan's foster home in Sunbury, Surrey. 'Rapid burn'\nMs Wilson said all the elements necessary for making the bomb were there, but there could have been \"a number of factors\" around why it did not work properly, including whether it was made correctly or if it had become wet. She said: \"My conclusion was there had been a partial explosion. Obviously this device had not fully detonated but something quite violent happened. \"It was likely to be a rapid burn rather than a detonation. \"The initiator mechanism, the battery, has functioned but the main charge had failed to function fully.\" House search\nAnother witness, counter terrorism officer Det Con Matt Rogers, told the court his team discovered the word \"bored\" written repeatedly on the door of Mr Hassan's bedroom when they searched his home on the day after the attack. Officers found a bottle of hydrogen peroxide on his wardrobe, which prosecutors allege he used to make the bomb, and parts of a soldering kit were found underneath his bed. They also discovered a ruler and supermarket loyalty card with traces of TATP on it behind a sofa in the house. 'Trained to kill'\nOn Thursday, the court heard from a number of witnesses to the explosion who described a \"rolling fireball\" coming towards them. The jury also heard about injuries to some of the passengers, including hair being set on fire and clothes melting, after the device partially detonated. On Wednesday, the prosecution also said that Mr Hassan had told Home Office officials, 20 months before the Parsons Green attack, that he had been \"trained to kill\". Prosecutor Alison Morgan said he was interviewed in Croydon in January 2016, where he is alleged to have told officials he had been taken by force by the so-called Islamic State group, who had threatened to kill his uncle and brother if he resisted. The trial continues. ",

        "content": "The largest ever Winter Paralympics were officially opened in freezing conditions at the Olympic Stadium in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Forty-eight different nations, plus a national Paralympic athletes team consisting of Russian competitors, entered the stadium in -5C temperatures. A record 567 athletes will take part across nine days of competition. Snowboarder Owen Pick led the British team into the arena as flagbearer. ParalympicsGB has sent a 17-strong team of athletes, though only snowboarders Pick, Ben Moore and James Barnes-Miller, and 2014 gold-medal-winning visually impaired skier Kelly Gallagher and her guide Gary Smith attended the ceremony. The remaining athletes compete on Saturday. The $106m 35,000-seater stadium, which will be pulled down after the closing ceremony, appeared to be about two thirds full, and the crowd watched a ceremony consisting of traditional Korean dance, combined with modern music and blended with light shows. Media playback is not supported on this device Unlike at last month's Olympics, where North and South Korean athletes walked under one united flag, the two countries could not strike a similar arrangement for the Paralympics opening ceremony. Instead, a North Korean party of 18 representatives walked with their own flag to mark their first appearance at a Winter Paralympics, although there are only two athletes competing - both in cross-country skiing - with the rest of the group made up of officials. There was no notable reaction for the North Korean entrance from the crowd, who were polite but subdued for most of the evening. The loudest moment came when the South Korean athletes entered the arena to complete the athlete parade. There was also a positive reaction when one athlete from North Korea and one from South Korea held the Paralympic flame aloft together before handing it over to start a relay which culminated with a Korean single-leg amputee abseiling up a ski slope before the cauldron was lit. There was barely a reaction when the Russian athletes entered the arena under a neutral flag and the team name neutral Paralympic athletes, after the nation was banned following a report which found evidence of state-sponsored doping. The USA has the largest contingent of athletes the Games, with 68, and were also greeted with a loud cheer. The British team were depleted by the number of athletes involved in competition on Saturday, but World Championship silver medallist Pick, a former soldier who had his leg amputated after being injured in Afghanistan, led from the front. He was ably supported by the energetic dancing and bouncing of Gallagher, who held the flag at the closing ceremony in Sochi four years ago after becoming the first Briton to win a gold medal on snow at either a Paralympics or Olympics. The ceremony itself, after the athlete parade, was sprayed with flashes of colour and featured a young girl directing illuminated fish as they swam in the arena floor, joyful children on sledges and boats, giant snowmen and a skateboarding mascot. One of the most memorable moments featured a DJ on a large wooden wheel lifted into the air to the sound of K-pop, the modern genre of pop music famous in Korea. International Paralympic Committee president Andrew Parsons impressed the crowd by greeting them in Korean at the start of his speech, adding \"Paralympic sport not only changes lives but changes the world\". He was followed by South Korea president Moon Jae-in, who officially opened the Games to a backdrop of fireworks and introduced the raising of the Paralympic flag. After the flame was lit, there was a further rendition of K-pop songs that got the crowd dancing and singing to end the ceremony. The sport will begin on Saturday with downhill skiing, biathlon, wheelchair curling and Para-ice hockey, with 36 medals on offer. GB's visually impaired duo of Mille Knight and Menna Fitzpatrick, along with their guides Brett Wild and Jen Kehoe, will hope to be among the downhill medals, while Chris Lloyd and James Whitley will race in the men's event. Elsewhere for Britain, Scott Meenagh will compete in the 7.5km biathlon and GB's wheelchair curlers start their campaign against Norway. ",

        "content": "A judge has advised US President Donald Trump to mute rather than block his Twitter critics after users of the service filed a lawsuit against him. Seven people sued Mr Trump after he blocked them from seeing his tweets, arguing that it was unconstitutional. But District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald suggested the president mute the accounts he does not want to see. \"Isn't the answer he just mutes the person he finds personally offensive?\" she asked the court in New York. \"He can avoid hearing them by muting them,\" she added. People on Twitter are unable to see or respond to tweets from accounts that block them. But if Mr Trump muted an account, he would not see that user's tweets but the user could still see and respond to his. The president is an avid user of the social media forum, and has more than 48 million followers on his @realDonaldTrump account which he uses to praise allies and lambast critics. My use of social media is not Presidential - it\u2019s MODERN DAY PRESIDENTIAL. Make America Great Again! End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump The hearing on Thursday came after a lawsuit was filed in July by the Knight First Amendment Institute, a free speech group at Columbia University. The seven Twitter users involved in the legal action say their accounts were blocked by the president, or his aides, after they replied to his tweets with mocking or critical comments. The complaint argues that by blocking these individuals, Mr Trump has barred them from joining the online conversation. The government says the president can choose who he interacts with on Twitter. Katie Fallow, an attorney representing the Twitter users, said the president had blocked people \"simply because they criticise him\". She said this represented \"viewpoint discrimination that violates the First Amendment\", which guarantees free speech under the US constitution. One of the users, Philip Cohen, said Mr Trump blocked him after he responded to one of his tweets with a mocked up image that labelled the president a \"corrupt incompetent authoritarian\". \"At first I was kind of proud, like 'oh he cares about me,'\" he told AFP news agency. \"But then very quickly I realized that a lot fewer people were seeing my tweets and my political efficacy, my ability to speak to my fellow citizens, was impaired by that. And I think that's not the way our government should act.\" Me right now. pic.twitter.com/m74hZsx1be End of Twitter post by @familyunequal But US Department of Justice attorney Michael Baer said that the president was free to decide who he interacted with. \"The president has an associational interest in deciding who he's going to spend his time with in that setting,\" he said. Lawyers on both sides said they would consider muting as a possible solution to the lawsuit. \"If there is a settlement that serves the interests of both parties, it is often considered the wiser way to go,\" Judge Buchwald said towards the end of the hearing.

The blubbery mammal was spotted by Lewis Hooper, a volunteer at North Ronaldsay bird observatory. He told BBC Radio Orkney: \"It turned and looked at me with these nice tusks coming down. And that was when it really sank in.\" The walrus was photographed again on the island of Sanday. Mr Hooper said it is not thought to be the same individual that was seen in March 2013, though it is the same species. \"I'd just decided to take the dog out in the evening, so we were walking along the coast and there was a group of gulls so I was having a look at them. \"I saw a big hump come out of the water, which I thought was maybe a small whale. \"I sprinted round the coast, and as I got to the edge of the coast I scanned along and it was actually sat on the beach. \"I'm no mammal expert, but it was pretty obvious what it was. It was clearly, clearly a walrus.\" Mr Hooper said the last walrus found in North Ronaldsay only stayed in the area for about a day so it was only seen by people living locally. But he said there had already been interest from people who want to travel to Orkney in the hope of seeing the animal. Sanday ranger Emma Neave-Webb, of Sanday Development Trust, said: \"My job here is very much looking after the local - and not so local - wildlife. A wonderful job, made all the better by sightings like this. \"This has certainly been the wildlife highlight of my time on Sanday so far - so exciting to see such a magnificent animal so close.\" ",

MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee had suggested a charge of 25p for disposable coffee cups to reduce their use. But ministers say it is better for shops to offer voluntary discounts to customers bringing their own cups. MPs says the government's response suggests it is not serious about its promise to tackle plastic litter. Committee chairwoman Mary Creagh said: \"The UK's throwaway culture is having a devastating impact on our streets, beaches and seas. Our report recommended practical solutions to the disposable packaging crisis. \"The government's response shows that despite warm words they plan no real action.\" She said evidence to the committee showed charges work better than discounts for reducing the use of non-recyclable materials - as was the case with the plastic bag charge. \"By choosing to favour voluntary discounts, the government is ignoring the evidence about what works,\" she said. The government said it was serious about the issue - but did not want to jump to hasty conclusions. In its response to the committee, it said: \"Coffee cups make up 0.7% of total paper packaging waste in the UK. We believe it is important to look at the packaging and waste management system as a whole.\" It said ministers had heard little evidence that recyclable cups would meet industry standards prohibiting coffee-covered containers from contaminating the recycling stream. More research is needed, ministers said. But the government did signal an intent to reform what's known as the \"producer responsibility\" system in which packaging firms chip in towards the cost of recycling technology. A report this week from the waste consultancy Eunomia said the industry was exaggerating the waste it recycles and paying far too little towards the \u00a32.8bn cost to households of collecting and dealing with waste. The alterative to throwaway cups\nMany of the large coffee shop chains in the UK now offer customers incentives to use reusable cups rather than the throwaway kind. Pret a Manger for example offers a 50p discount while Costa Coffee and Starbucks will knock 25p off. But studies suggest people are more likely to respond to extra charges, for example the plastic bag charge, than they are to discounts. With this in mind, Starbucks is also running a three month trial in some of its central London stores charging those using throwaway cups an extra 5p. Other possible alternatives include making the throwaway cups easier to recycle or creating edible ones. The National Audit Office is launching a review of the government's oversight of the system, following a request from the Environmental Audit Committee, which has concerns that it is opaque, and could be subject to fraud and non-compliance. The government said the idea of a latte tax would be considered as part of a call for evidence on single-use plastics. That initiative was promised by the chancellor in the autumn budget but it hasn't happened yet. Follow Roger on Twitter. ",

We believe it is important to look at the packaging and waste management system as a whole.\" The government did signal an intent to reform what's known as the \"producer responsibility\" system in which packaging firms chip in towards the cost of recycling technology. A report this week from the waste consultancy Eunomia said the industry was exaggerating the waste it recycles and paying far too little towards the \u00a32.8bn cost to households of collecting and dealing with waste. The alterative to throwaway cups\nMany of the large coffee shop chains in the UK now offer customers incentives to use reusable cups rather than the throwaway kind. Pret a Manger for example offers a 50p discount while Costa Coffee and Starbucks will knock 25p off. But studies suggest people are more likely to respond to extra charges, for example the plastic bag charge, than they are to discounts. With this in mind, Starbucks is also running a three month trial in some of its central London stores charging those using throwaway cups an extra 5p. Other possible alternatives include making the throwaway cups easier to recycle or creating edible ones. The National Audit Office is launching a review of the government's oversight of the system, following a request from the Environmental Audit Committee, which has concerns that it is opaque, and could be subject to fraud and non-compliance. The government said the idea of a latte tax would be considered as part of a call for evidence on single-use plastics. That initiative was promised by the chancellor in the autumn budget but it hasn't happened yet. Follow Roger on Twitter. ",

        "content": "About 180 military personnel have been deployed to Salisbury to help in the investigation into the attempted murder of an ex-Russian spy and his daughter. The military personnel - drawn mostly from the Army, but also from the Royal Marines and RAF - are experts in chemical warfare and decontamination. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia collapsed on Sunday afternoon after being exposed to a nerve agent. Home Secretary Amber Rudd has described the attack as \"outrageous\". Those deployed include instructors from the Defence Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Centre and the 29 Explosive Ordnance Group, who are experts in bomb disposal. The Metropolitan Police said the counter-terrorism unit has requested the military's assistance \"to remove a number of vehicles and objects from the scene\", including ambulances that may have been contaminated while assisting the victims. The public should not be alarmed and there is no evidence to suggest a wide public health risk at this time, the police added. Valery Morozov, a Russian exile, told BBC News that Mr Skripal was working in cyber security. The former Russian military security colonel and his daughter remain in a critical condition at Salisbury District Hospital. Det Sgt Nick Bailey - who attended the scene on Sunday - is conscious but \"very anxious\" about being exposed to a nerve agent. Director of nursing Lorna Wilkinson said Mr Bailey was in a serious but stable condition. Specialist investigators wearing protective suits have been seen examining the bench that Mr Skripal and his daughter collapsed on. Mr Skripal's house and his car have also been cordoned off. It is known that Mr Skripal and his daughter had visited the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found near the Maltings shopping centre. Ms Rudd visited some of the sites cordoned off by counter-terrorism police in Salisbury on Friday. She also visited Salisbury District Hospital where Mr Skripal, his daughter, and Mr Bailey are being treated. The home secretary, who met Mr Bailey in hospital, would not give any further details of the nerve agent used or how it was administered. The graves of Mr Skripal's wife and son at a Salisbury cemetery have also been taped off. Mr Skripal, 66, was convicted by the Russian government of passing secrets to MI6, but given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a \"spy swap\". Former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Blair said the \"extraordinary attack in Salisbury\" is a good reason to investigate whether there is a pattern of former British intelligence collaborators dying in the UK. Former First Sea Lord and security minister Lord West said: \"If it is a nation which has done it, it is completely unacceptable. It's almost like an act of war. \"To actually allow something like a nerve agent to be used in another country for some reason is outrageous.\" Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has denied his country's involvement in the attempted murder of the ex-spy. The attempted murder of Mr Skripal has drawn comparisons to the 2006 assassination of Alexander Litvinenko, who ingested the rare and highly radioactive Polonium 210 in London. On Tuesday Labour MP Yvette Cooper asked the home secretary to review 14 other deaths that had not been treated as suspicious by UK police, but have reportedly been identified by US intelligence sources as being connected to the Russian state. Ms Rudd has refused to speculate on whether the Russian state might have been involved in the attack, saying the police investigation should be based on \"facts, not rumour\".

        "content": "Job creation in the US economy surged last month, but the annual rate of wage growth slowed. The economy created 313,000 jobs in February, official figures show, far in excess of analysts' expectations. However, the unemployment rate remained at 4.1%, while the annual earnings growth rate slowed to 2.6% last month. January's annual wage growth rate - which had triggered fears over inflationary pressures - was also revised down from 2.9% to 2.8%. The strong wage growth figure for January prompted sharp volatility on the stock market, as investors worried the US Federal Reserve would quicken the pace at which it increased interest rates. Despite a lower-than-expected wage increase in February, economists said longer term trends still point to higher wages. US stock markets opened higher in reaction to the US Labor Department's report, which showed the biggest increase in jobs since July 2016. The number of people working or looking for work also jumped by more than 800,000 last month. That was the biggest over-the-month rise in the labour force since 2003. \"We have an economy that is firing on all cylinders and the job market is a reflection of that,\" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Bank. February's gains included an increase of 61,000 construction jobs - the biggest rise since 2007. The manufacturing sector also added 31,000 jobs, while retail jobs rebounded from declines last year.

        "content": "The man accused of planting a bomb on a London tube train admitted to police he made the device, a court has heard. Ahmed Hassan was arrested the day after the bomb partially detonated on a District Line train at Parsons Green on 15 September 2017, injuring many of the 93 passengers on board. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. Det Con James Charalambous said Mr Hassan told him he made the bomb and no-one else was involved. Prosecutors say Ahmed Hassan built the device and set the timer, before leaving it on the train one stop earlier. Explosives expert Sarah Wilson said, had the device fully detonated, it had the potential to be \"lethal\". She told the court the bomb contained 400g of an explosive that with just one gram could cause \"serious injury\". Police interview\nDet Con Charalambous told the Old Bailey he interviewed Mr Hassan at the Port of Dover - where he was arrested - at around 10:15 GMT on 16 September. The Metropolitan Police counter terrorism officer asked the 18-year-old: \"Who made the Tube bomb?\" He is said to have replied: \"I did.\" The officer said that Mr Hassan told police they may also find a small amount of explosives at his home in Sudbury, Surrey. 'Unstable and unpredictable'\nEarlier, Ms Wilson told the court that tests on the remains of the device showed the explosive chemical compound TATP had been used. The jury heard how just one gram of the chemical compound could cause \"serious injury to people or property\", but that the device had contained around 400g, along with 2.2kg of shrapnel to cause further damage. Ms Wilson described TATP as a \"sensitive primary high explosive\" which is \"very unstable and unpredictable\" - so is not produced for commercial or military use - and the bomb could be detonated just by being dropped. It would have taken several hours to create that amount of the substance, she said, along with the small amount that was discovered at Mr Hassan's foster home in Sunbury, Surrey.

        "content": "UK engineering giant GKN has agreed to merge part of its business with US company Dana, as it seeks to fend off a takeover bid from Melrose Industries. The merger will combine GKN's Driveline division with US auto-engineer Dana in a deal worth $6.1bn (\u00a34.4bn). It comes as Melrose has a \u00a37.4bn offer on the table to buy all of GKN. But GKN said the Dana deal \"provides significantly greater value\" than Melrose's bid, which is subject to scrutiny by UK MPs and regulators. Earlier this week, a cross-party group of MPs wrote to the Business Secretary, Greg Clark, saying the Melrose takeover should be blocked. Either deal still needs to be signed-off by GKN shareholders, who will now have to assess the merits of the two alternatives. The chairman of GKN, Mike Turner, said of the Dana merger: \"This combination of GKN Driveline and Dana will create a US and UK led global market leader in vehicle drive systems. \"The synergies between these two businesses and our complementary product portfolios make this a great deal for GKN shareholders.\" Under the terms of the proposed tie-up, GKN shareholders will end up with a 47.25% stake in the enlarged, US-listed group. FTSE 100-listed GKN will also get $1.6bn in cash from a merger. Dana will also take on $1bn in pension liabilities and issue $3.5bn worth of shares to GKN investors. Engineering a response\nThe Dana deal is part of GKN's Project Boost - which the UK company hopes will dissuade shareholders from agreeing to the Melrose takeover. GKN argues that splitting the company into aerospace and driveline business would be more beneficial. Dana said the combined entity would have sales of approximately $13.4bn and deliver $235m of annual cost savings within three years. A new UK-domiciled company will be created if the Dana-GKN deal is approved, but it will keep Dana's New York listing and its Ohio headquarters. The Unite union's assistant general secretary for manufacturing, Tony Burke, said: \"Over the coming days we will be seeking assurances over jobs and investment to ensure that any merger strengthens the position of GKN's Driveline division as a world leader.\" Melrose specialises in buying up industrial companies it believes are undervalued and restructuring them before selling them on. That has raised fears with unions and MPs that GKN, one of the UK's largest industrial firms, will be broken up and sold to overseas owners. The Pensions Regulator has warned that the Melrose takeover could affect the company's ability to fund its pension scheme. Melrose shareholders overwhelmingly voted in favour of the GKN takeover deal on Thursday.

        "content": "The man accused of planting a bomb on a London tube train admitted to police he made the device, a court has heard. Ahmed Hassan was arrested the day after the bomb partially detonated on a District Line train at Parsons Green on 15 September 2017, injuring many of the 93 passengers on board. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. Det Con James Charalambous said Mr Hassan told him he made the bomb and no-one else was involved. Prosecutors say Ahmed Hassan built the device and set the timer, before leaving it on the train one stop earlier. Explosives expert Sarah Wilson said, had the device fully detonated, it had the potential to be \"lethal\". She told the court the bomb contained 400g of an explosive that with just one gram could cause \"serious injury\". Police interview\nDet Con Charalambous told the Old Bailey he interviewed Mr Hassan at the Port of Dover - where he was arrested - at around 10:15 GMT on 16 September. The Metropolitan Police counter terrorism officer asked the 18-year-old: \"Who made the Tube bomb?\" He is said to have replied: \"I did.\" The officer said that Mr Hassan told police they may also find a small amount of explosives at his home in Sudbury, Surrey. 'Unstable and unpredictable'\nEarlier, Ms Wilson told the court that tests on the remains of the device showed the explosive chemical compound TATP had been used. The jury heard how just one gram of the chemical compound could cause \"serious injury to people or property\", but that the device had contained around 400g, along with 2.2kg of shrapnel to cause further damage. Ms Wilson described TATP as a \"sensitive primary high explosive\" which is \"very unstable and unpredictable\" - so is not produced for commercial or military use - and the bomb could be detonated just by being dropped. It would have taken several hours to create that amount of the substance, she said, along with the small amount that was discovered at Mr Hassan's foster home in Sunbury, Surrey.

        "content": "About 180 military personnel have been deployed to Salisbury to help in the investigation into the attempted murder of an ex-Russian spy and his daughter. The military personnel - drawn mostly from the Army, but also from the Royal Marines and RAF - are experts in chemical warfare and decontamination. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia collapsed on Sunday afternoon after being exposed to a nerve agent. Home Secretary Amber Rudd has described the attack as \"outrageous\". Those deployed include instructors from the Defence Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Centre and the 29 Explosive Ordnance Group, who are experts in bomb disposal. The military has also sent 80 vehicles. The Metropolitan Police said the counter-terrorism unit has requested the military's assistance \"to remove a number of vehicles and objects from the scene\", including ambulances that may have been contaminated while assisting the victims. The public should not be alarmed and there is no evidence to suggest a wide public health risk at this time, the police added. Valery Morozov, a Russian exile, told BBC News that Mr Skripal was working in cyber security. The former Russian military security colonel and his daughter remain in a critical condition at Salisbury District Hospital. Det Sgt Nick Bailey - who attended the scene on Sunday - is conscious but \"very anxious\" about being exposed to a nerve agent. Director of nursing Lorna Wilkinson said Mr Bailey was in a serious but stable condition. Specialist investigators wearing protective suits have been seen examining the bench that Mr Skripal and his daughter collapsed on. Mr Skripal's house and his car have also been cordoned off. It is known that Mr Skripal and his daughter had visited the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found near the Maltings shopping centre. Analysis\nBy Jonathan Beale, BBC defence correspondent Some of the 180 military personnel who have been sent to help the investigation are specialists in chemical biological radiological and nuclear (CBRN) warfare. They include Falcon Squadron from the Royal Tank Regiment, which uses specialist Fuchs vehicles - effectively mobile laboratories - to carry out tests and decontamination. \"Sensitive Site Exploitation\" will look for any further traces of the nerve agent. Royal Marines from 40 Commando have also just completed the UK's biggest chemical warfare exercise - called Toxic Dagger - involving 300 personnel and including scientists from Porton Down. The existence of these units - some of which had suffered under defence cuts - highlights a growing concern in the military about the use of chemical weapons by individuals, terrorist groups and \"rogue states\". But the public is being told not to be alarmed. Many of the military personnel will be working behind the scenes and helping the police with relatively straightforward tasks, such as securing sites and removing objects, including ambulances, for decontamination. Ms Rudd visited some of the sites cordoned off by counter-terrorism police in Salisbury on Friday. She also visited Salisbury District Hospital where Mr Skripal, his daughter, and Mr Bailey are being treated. The home secretary, who met Mr Bailey in hospital, would not give any further details of the nerve agent used or how it was administered. The graves of Mr Skripal's wife and son at a Salisbury cemetery have also been taped off. Mr Skripal, 66, was convicted by the Russian government of passing secrets to MI6, but given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a \"spy swap\". Former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Blair said the \"extraordinary attack in Salisbury\" is a good reason to investigate whether there is a pattern of former British intelligence collaborators dying in the UK. Former First Sea Lord and security minister Lord West said: \"If it is a nation which has done it, it is completely unacceptable. It's almost like an act of war. \"To actually allow something like a nerve agent to be used in another country for some reason is outrageous.\" Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has denied his country's involvement in the attempted murder of the ex-spy. The attempted murder of Mr Skripal has drawn comparisons to the 2006 assassination of Alexander Litvinenko, who ingested the rare and highly radioactive Polonium 210 in London. On Tuesday Labour MP Yvette Cooper asked the home secretary to review 14 other deaths that had not been treated as suspicious by UK police, but have reportedly been identified by US intelligence sources as being connected to the Russian state. Ms Rudd has refused to speculate on whether the Russian state might have been involved in the attack, saying the police investigation should be based on \"facts, not rumour\".

        "content": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for the European Union to be exempted from new US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. \"The best option would be [for the EU] to be excluded,\" she told business leaders gathered in Munich. Ms Merkel warned that no one could win a \"race to the bottom\" and said the tariffs risked \"hurting everyone\". President Donald Trump says the US has suffered from \"unfair trade\" and that the tariffs will boost industry. The import duties - 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium - will go into effect in 15 days, although Canada and Mexico will be exempt while negotiations continue over the North America Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Mr Trump signed the declaration in a White House ceremony attended by American workers from both industries. What has the international reaction been?\nWhat about inside the US?\nThere was strong opposition from within Mr Trump's own Republican Party, which is traditionally in favour of free trade. US House Speaker Paul Ryan denounced the new measures and said he feared \"unintended consequences\". Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said he believed the president had been \"misled\" by those advising him at the White House. Another Republican Senator, Jeff Flake, said he would draft and introduce a bill to nullify the tariffs, adding: \"I urge my colleagues to pass it before this exercise in protectionism inflicts any more damage on the economy.\" However, those who backed Mr Trump's move included Democratic Senator Joe Manchin who said it was \"past time to defend our interests, our security and our workers in the global economy\". Why did Donald Trump do this?\nIn his election campaign, Mr Trump pledged to protect American workers and to rebuild the steel and aluminium industries. The two metals are \"the backbone of our nation... the bedrock of our defence-industrial base\", the president said at Thursday's signing ceremony. \"Our greatest presidents from Washington, to Jackson, to Lincoln, to McKinley and others - they protected our country from outside influence, from other countries coming in and stealing our wealth and stealing our jobs and stealing our companies,\" he said. \"And we're going to be very fair, we're going to be very flexible, but we're going to protect the American worker, as I said I would do in my campaign.\" Correspondents say Mr Trump is aiming to appeal to blue-collar voters in states such as Pennsylvania who turned away from the Democrats to support him in 2016. What could happen next?\nMr Trump has said that the US would \"win big\" in any trade war. Some countries are likely to take the US to court, arguing that the decision violates World Trade Organization rules. The White House, however, says that the national security rationale for the move is \"unassailable\" and national security considerations are allowed under WTO rules. The director of UK Steel said the tariffs would have a profound and detrimental impact on the UK steel sector. \"Imposing such measures on US allies in the name of national security is difficult to comprehend,\" Gareth Stace added.

        "content": "North Korea agreeing to discuss denuclearisation \"is evidence that President [Donald] Trump's strategy to isolate the Kim regime is working,\" US Vice-President Mike Pence has said. He said the US had made \"zero concessions\" and \"consistently increased the pressure\" on North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. An unprecedented summit between the two leaders is due to take place by May. It comes only months after the pair hurled insults at each other. Mr Trump has hailed the dizzying shift in North Korea's position as \"great progress\" but said sanctions would remain in place. South Korean envoys earlier briefed the US president on the meeting they had this week with Mr Kim, saying he was now \"committed to denuclearisation\". South Korea's President Moon Jae-in said the news of the Kim-Trump meeting had come \"like a miracle\". \"If President Trump and Chairman Kim meet following an inter-Korean summit, complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula will be put on the right track in earnest,\" he said. However, correspondents say the North has halted missile and nuclear tests during previous talks, only to resume them when it lost patience or felt it was not getting what it demanded. In his statement, Mr Pence said the \"maximum pressure campaign will continue until North Korea takes concrete, permanent, and verifiable steps to end their nuclear programme\". Mr Trump's strategy has been roundly praised by the South Koreans. Chinese President Xi Jinping also telephoned him on Friday to welcome the development and urge all sides to show goodwill and avoid doing anything that could impede the improving situation on the Korean peninsula, reported Reuters news agency, Why is the US suddenly interested in talks?\nThe US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, speaking in Djibouti on an African trip, said of Kim Jong-un: \"What changed was his posture in a fairly dramatic way. \"In all honesty, that came as a little bit of a surprise to us, as well that he was so forward-leaning in his conversations with the delegation from South Korea.\" In recent months, Mr Trump has belittled Mr Kim as the \"rocket man\", threatening him with \"fire and fury\", while Mr Kim has called Mr Trump \"a mentally deranged US dotard\". The speed of events appears to have caught Mr Tillerson off-guard - on Wednesday he said the US was \"a long way\" from negotiations with the North. There has been no mention of the developments as yet on North Korean state media. Moon's huge gamble\nAnalysis by the BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul South Korean President Moon Jae-in has acknowledged there are obstacles ahead. He is managing expectations and so much can go wrong. His approval ratings took a hit during the Winter Olympics after he integrated the women's hockey team with players from the North and met a general from Pyongyang who had been accused of masterminding deadly attacks on South Koreans, though they have since rebounded. These talks are a huge gamble with a communist state which is hard to read. But if, just if, he helps pull it off, it may reduce the threat of nuclear war and he could win himself a Nobel Peace Prize. If all fails, it is back to brinkmanship. Read Laura's piece in full How did we reach this point?\nThe South Korean envoys met Mr Kim in Pyongyang this week. It was the culmination of a rapprochement that began at the New Year and led to the Koreas marching together at the Winter Olympics. The envoys then travelled to Washington to brief Mr Trump. Speaking outside the White House after the meeting, South Korean National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong said that: In a statement sent to the Washington Post, North Korea's UN ambassador said the \"courageous decision\" of Mr Kim would help secure \"peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and the East Asia region\". There is no indication yet of where the Trump-Kim talks might take place, but the Korean border's demilitarised zone (DMZ) and Beijing are seen as likely options. What could be on the agenda?\nClearly for the US, South Korea and allied nations, denuclearisation is the key issue. North Korea has been isolated for decades because of its pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws. The North has carried out six nuclear tests and has missiles that could reach the US. However, the BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says it is important to note that North Korea has not yet promised to abandon its nuclear weapons completely. The North's well-documented human rights abuses are also a key issue for the US. So what does the North want? An easing, if not removal, of sanctions certainly. A former British ambassador to North Korea, John Everard, told the BBC there must be a suspicion that Mr Kim might be trying to play Mr Trump to try to \"get him to say across the table things that North Korea has been asking for for a long time\". These could include a peace treaty to finally end the Korean War and a promise that if North Korea denuclearised then the US would finally withdraw its troops from South Korea. The US has tens of thousands of military personnel there and the massive annual joint war games infuriate the North because it believes they are preparation for invasion. What have the other players said?\nThe reaction has been positive, if cautious: Have talks like this happened in the past?\nNo sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader, but there have been repeated attempts to get North Korea to denuclearise. The last major effort - the Six Party talks - collapsed in 2008, largely because North Korea refused to allow inspectors to verify that it had shut down its nuclear programme. A number of bids to restart the talks after that also collapsed. ",

        "content": "Job creation in the US economy surged last month, but the annual rate of wage growth slowed. The economy created 313,000 jobs in February, official figures show, far in excess of analysts' expectations. However, the unemployment rate remained at 4.1%, while the annual earnings growth rate slowed to 2.6% last month. January's annual wage growth rate - which had triggered fears over inflationary pressures - was also revised down from 2.9% to 2.8%. The strong wage growth figure for January prompted sharp volatility on the stock market, as investors worried the US Federal Reserve would quicken the pace at which it increased interest rates. 'Firing on all cylinders'\nDespite a lower-than-expected wage increase in February, many economists said longer term trends still point to higher wages. US stock markets opened higher in reaction to the US Labor Department's report, which showed the biggest increase in jobs since July 2016. \"We have an economy that is firing on all cylinders and the job market is a reflection of that,\" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Bank. The US economy is in its ninth year of economic expansion, with an upswing in global growth and tax cuts passed last year helping to boost growth. February's gains included an increase of 61,000 construction jobs - the biggest rise since 2007. The manufacturing sector also added 31,000 jobs, while retail jobs rebounded from declines last year. The number of people working or looking for work also jumped by more than 800,000 last month. That was the biggest monthly rise in the labour force since 2003 and boosted labour force participation to 63%. Those figures provided fodder for analysts who say wage growth could be moderated by a large number of potential workers sitting on the sidelines. \"The huge gain in payrolls belies the notion that the [labour] market has truly reached full employment,\" said Sophia Koropeckyj of Moody's Analytics. However, she also said a slow acceleration in wage growth was \"inevitable\" this year. The average hourly wage for private sector workers was $26.75 last month, up 68 cents from February 2017 and 4 cents from January. Markets are expecting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at least three times this year, including at its meeting later this month. ",

        "content": "Kenya's president and opposition leader have promised to begin a process of reconciliation following last year's bitterly contested election. Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga called each other \"brothers\" following their first public meeting since the poll. About 150 people were killed in the aftermath of the disputed election. Earlier this year, Mr Odinga swore himself in as the \"people's president\" and refused to recognise election winner Mr Kenyatta as head of state. Until now, both had dismissed all calls for talks, from Kenyans and foreign diplomats. In their joint address, President Kenyatta said: \"We will begin a process of discussing what ails us and what creates division amongst us.\" Mr Odinga said it was \"time to resolve our differences\". Pre-emptive PR stunt?\nAnalysis by Ferdinand Omondi, BBC Africa, Nairobi Resolving the two men's differences won't be so easy. Kenya is sharply divided along ethnic lines because of the political stand-off. The opposition charges of rigged elections, police brutality and state high-handedness were not mentioned - only a joint call for national dialogue. The unexpected public appearance comes as US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visits Kenya as part of his visit to Africa. In Ethiopia, he criticised the government for declaring a state of emergency. So some see this meeting as a pre-emptive public relations stunt to water down any potential dressing-down; while others have welcomed the announcement as long overdue. Whichever explanation rings true, Kenya is headed for an intriguing second episode of political drama. President Kenyatta was sworn in for a second term last November. He won an election re-run in October, which Mr Odinga had boycotted. Elections were first held in August but the courts ordered a re-run, saying Mr Kenyatta's victory was marred by irregularities. Mr Odinga said that nothing had been changed before the re-run. ",

The robot was installed at a Cali Burger outlet in Pasadena and replaced human cooks. But after just one day at work the robot has been taken offline, so it can be upgraded to cook more quickly. Its human helpers are also getting extra training to help it keep up with demand at the restaurant. Handy helper\nUSA Today reported that the robot was still in place behind the grill at the burger joint but was switched off. A sign said the robot would be \"cooking soon\" but gave no date for when it would once again be flipping hamburger patties. The robot is believed to have been given time off because news about it spread widely, and led to more interest and orders than the restaurant could handle. In a statement Miso Robotics, which made Flippy, said it was testing the code that controls the robot to ensure that it can cook quickly enough to fulfil orders at peak times. Prior to starting work, Flippy was said to be capable of cooking up to 2,000 burgers a day. You may also like:\nCali Burger said it was also working with staff to show them the best way to prepare and place the raw patties and other ingredients in its burgers to ensure Flippy works as fast as possible. Anthony Lomelino, head of technology at Cali Burger, told USA Today that kitchen staff needed to learn to \"choreograph\" their movements around the motions of the mobile, spatula-fitted arm which Flippy uses to cook. Cali said that it started to use the robot to get around the problems it has recruiting staff. The high turnover rate among staff in fast-food restaurants meant it often spent time and money training people to prepare food only to have them leave after a few months. Eventually, said the chain, burger-flipping robots will be installed in up to 50 of its restaurants. ",

        "content": "The man accused of planting a bomb on a London Tube train admitted to police he made the device, a court has heard. Ahmed Hassan was arrested the day after the bomb partially detonated on a District Line train at Parsons Green on 15 September 2017, injuring many of the 93 passengers on board. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. Det Con James Charalambous said Mr Hassan told him he made the bomb and no-one else was involved. Prosecutors say Ahmed Hassan built the device and set the timer, before leaving it on the train one stop earlier. Explosives expert Sarah Wilson said, had the device fully detonated, it had the potential to be \"lethal\". She told the court the bomb contained 400g of an explosive that with just one gram could cause \"serious injury\". Police interview\nDet Con Charalambous told the Old Bailey he interviewed Mr Hassan at the Port of Dover - where he was arrested - at around 10:15 GMT on 16 September. The Metropolitan Police counter terrorism officer asked the 18-year-old: \"Who made the Tube bomb?\" He is said to have replied: \"I did.\" The officer said that Mr Hassan told police they may also find a small amount of explosives at his home in Sudbury, Surrey. The court then heard that over the next four days the suspect was interviewed seven more times and answered \"no comment\". However, on one occasion he read a prepared statement, which repeated his claim that no-one else was involved in the attack. 'Unstable and unpredictable'\nEarlier, Ms Wilson told the court that tests on the remains of the device showed the explosive chemical compound TATP had been used. The jury heard how just one gram of the chemical compound could cause \"serious injury to people or property\", but that the device had contained around 400g, along with 2.2kg of shrapnel to cause further damage. Ms Wilson described TATP as a \"sensitive primary high explosive\" which is \"very unstable and unpredictable\" - so is not produced for commercial or military use - and the bomb could be detonated just by being dropped. It would have taken several hours to create that amount of the substance, she said, along with the small amount that was discovered at Mr Hassan's foster home in Sunbury, Surrey. 'Rapid burn'\nMs Wilson said all the elements necessary for making the bomb were there, but there could have been \"a number of factors\" around why it did not work properly, including whether it was made correctly or if it had become wet. She said: \"My conclusion was there had been a partial explosion. Obviously this device had not fully detonated but something quite violent happened. \"It was likely to be a rapid burn rather than a detonation. \"The initiator mechanism, the battery, has functioned but the main charge had failed to function fully.\" House search\nAnother witness, counter terrorism officer Det Con Matt Rogers, told the court his team discovered the word \"bored\" written repeatedly on the door of Mr Hassan's bedroom when they searched his home on the day after the attack. Officers found a bottle of hydrogen peroxide on his wardrobe, which prosecutors allege he used to make the bomb, and parts of a soldering kit were found underneath his bed. They also discovered a ruler and supermarket loyalty card with traces of TATP on it behind a sofa in the house. 'Trained to kill'\nOn Thursday, the court heard from a number of witnesses to the explosion who described a \"rolling fireball\" coming towards them. The jury also heard about injuries to some of the passengers, including hair being set on fire and clothes melting, after the device partially detonated. On Wednesday, the prosecution also said that Mr Hassan had told Home Office officials, 20 months before the Parsons Green attack, that he had been \"trained to kill\". Prosecutor Alison Morgan said he was interviewed in Croydon in January 2016, where he is alleged to have told officials he had been taken by force by the so-called Islamic State group, who had threatened to kill his uncle and brother if he resisted. The jury has been sent home for the weekend and the trial will continue on Monday. ",

        "content": "The British genome pioneer Sir John Sulston has died aged 75. He came to international prominence as the British face of the project to decode the human genome. Sir John won a Nobel Prize in 2002 for his contribution to the understanding of how genes control cell division and cell death in the nematode worm. He also helped found the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute at Hinxton near Cambridge. The Institute now runs the largest genomics programme in Europe, and the laboratories there bear his name. Prof Sir Mike Stratton, director of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said Sir John had a burning and unrelenting commitment to making genome data open to all without restriction. \"We all feel the loss today of a great scientific visionary and leader who made historic, landmark contributions to knowledge of the living world, and established a mission and agenda that defines 21st century science,\" he said. Jeremy Farrar, director of the biomedical research charity, Wellcome, said his leadership was critical to the Human Genome Project, one of the most important scientific endeavours of the past century. \"His dedication to free access to scientific information was the basis of the open access movement, and helped ensure that the reference human genome sequence was published openly for the benefit of all humanity,\" he said. Sir John was born in 1942. He studied for his degree in organic chemistry and PhD in nucleotide chemistry at the University of Cambridge. In 2017, he was made a Companion of Honour by the Queen in her birthday honours for his contribution to science and society. At the time of his death, he was Professor and Chair of the Institute of Science, Ethics and Innovation at the University of Manchester. ",

        "content": "North Korea agreeing to discuss denuclearisation \"is evidence that President [Donald] Trump's strategy to isolate the Kim regime is working,\" US Vice-President Mike Pence has said. He said the US had made \"zero concessions\" and \"consistently increased the pressure\" on North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. An unprecedented summit between the two leaders is due to take place by May. It comes only months after the pair hurled insults at each other. Mr Trump has hailed the dizzying shift in North Korea's position as \"great progress\" but said sanctions would remain in place. South Korean envoys earlier briefed the US president on the meeting they had this week with Mr Kim, saying he was now \"committed to denuclearisation\". South Korea's President Moon Jae-in said the news of the Kim-Trump meeting had come \"like a miracle\". \"If President Trump and Chairman Kim meet following an inter-Korean summit, complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula will be put on the right track in earnest,\" he said. However, correspondents say the North has halted missile and nuclear tests during previous talks, only to resume them when it lost patience or felt it was not getting what it demanded. In his statement, Mr Pence said the \"maximum pressure campaign will continue until North Korea takes concrete, permanent, and verifiable steps to end their nuclear programme\". Mr Trump's strategy has been roundly praised by the South Koreans. Chinese President Xi Jinping also telephoned him on Friday to welcome the development and urge all sides to show goodwill and avoid doing anything that could impede the improving situation on the Korean peninsula. Why is the US suddenly interested in talks?\nThe US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, speaking in Djibouti on an African trip, said of Kim Jong-un: \"What changed was his posture in a fairly dramatic way. \"In all honesty, that came as a little bit of a surprise to us, as well that he was so forward-leaning in his conversations with the delegation from South Korea.\" In recent months, Mr Trump has belittled Mr Kim as the \"rocket man\", threatening him with \"fire and fury\", while Mr Kim has called Mr Trump \"a mentally deranged US dotard\". The speed of events appears to have caught Mr Tillerson off-guard - on Thursday he said the US was \"a long way\" from direct talks. There has been no mention of the developments as yet on North Korean state media. Moon's huge gamble\nAnalysis by the BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul South Korean President Moon Jae-in has acknowledged there are obstacles ahead. He is managing expectations and so much can go wrong. His approval ratings took a hit during the Winter Olympics after he integrated the women's hockey team with players from the North and met a general from Pyongyang who had been accused of masterminding deadly attacks on South Koreans, though they have since rebounded. These talks are a huge gamble with a communist state which is hard to read. But if, just if, he helps pull it off, it may reduce the threat of nuclear war and he could win himself a Nobel Peace Prize. If all fails, it is back to brinkmanship. Read Laura's piece in full How did we reach this point?\nThe South Korean envoys met Mr Kim in Pyongyang this week. It was the culmination of a rapprochement that began at the New Year and led to the Koreas marching together at the Winter Olympics. The envoys then travelled to Washington to brief Mr Trump. Speaking outside the White House after the meeting, South Korean National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong said that: In a statement sent to the Washington Post, North Korea's UN ambassador said the \"courageous decision\" of Mr Kim would help secure \"peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and the East Asia region\". There is no indication yet of where the Trump-Kim talks might take place, but the Korean border's demilitarised zone (DMZ) and Beijing are seen as likely options. What could be on the agenda?\nClearly for the US, South Korea and allied nations, denuclearisation is the key issue. North Korea has been isolated for decades because of its pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws. The North has carried out six nuclear tests and has missiles that could reach the US. However, the BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says it is important to note that North Korea has not yet promised to abandon its nuclear weapons completely. The North's well-documented human rights abuses are also a key issue for the US. So what does the North want? An easing, if not removal, of sanctions certainly. A former British ambassador to North Korea, John Everard, told the BBC there must be a suspicion that Mr Kim might be trying to play Mr Trump to try to \"get him to say across the table things that North Korea has been asking for for a long time\". These could include a peace treaty to finally end the Korean War and a promise that if North Korea denuclearised then the US would finally withdraw its troops from South Korea. The US has tens of thousands of military personnel there and the massive annual joint war games infuriate the North because it believes they are preparation for invasion. What have the other players said?\nThe reaction has been positive, if cautious: Have talks like this happened in the past?\nNo sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader, but there have been repeated attempts to get North Korea to denuclearise. The last major effort - the Six Party talks - collapsed in 2008, largely because North Korea refused to allow inspectors to verify that it had shut down its nuclear programme. A number of bids to restart the talks after that also collapsed. ",

        "content": "Spain's Supreme Court says the man nominated to lead Catalonia's regional government cannot be freed from jail to attend an investiture ceremony. Pro-independence activist Jordi Sanchez, 53, had asked to be released to attend Monday's debate and vote in the Catalan parliament. He was jailed on sedition charges after October's independence referendum, which was deemed illegal by Spain. The judge said there was a risk Mr Sanchez would reoffend. Mr Sanchez was nominated as Catalonia's leader by separatist parties after the former head, Carles Puigdemont, last week formally abandoned his attempt to be reappointed. He has backed Mr Sanchez, who is the only candidate. Mr Puigdemont fled to Belgium after the referendum to avoid detention. He remains there, fearing arrest if he returns. The separatist parties won a slim majority in regional elections in December. Those elections had been called by the central government after it sacked the regional administration and imposed direct rule when the independence referendum was declared illegal. Judge Pablo Llarena ruled on Friday that although Mr Sanchez had the right to participate in public affairs, those rights could be curtailed if there was a risk of reoffending. It remains unclear what will happen to Monday's planned investiture debate. Mr Puigdemont refused to rule out new elections if Mr Sanchez could not be sworn in. \"It is no tragedy if there are new elections, although it is not the priority and no-one desires it,\" he told Catalan newspaper El Punt Avui. The central government has vowed to oppose any attempt by Catalonia to break away and has told its parties to choose a leader who is not in jail. Twenty-eight Catalan politicians are being investigated by a Supreme Court judge for their role in the referendum and a subsequent declaration of independence. Mr Sanchez and three others remain in jail: former vice-president Oriol Junqueras, Catalan ex-Interior Minister Joaquim Forn and grassroots separatist leader Jordi Cuixart. This is Spain's biggest political crisis since democracy was restored to the country in 1975. ",

        "content": "About 180 military personnel have been deployed to Salisbury to help in the investigation into the attempted murder of an ex-Russian spy and his daughter. The military personnel - drawn mostly from the Army, but also from the Royal Marines and RAF - are experts in chemical warfare and decontamination. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia collapsed on Sunday afternoon after being exposed to a nerve agent. Home Secretary Amber Rudd has described the attack as \"outrageous\". Those deployed include instructors from the Defence Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Centre and the 29 Explosive Ordnance Group, who are experts in bomb disposal. The military has also sent 18 vehicles. The Metropolitan Police said the counter-terrorism unit has requested the military's assistance \"to remove a number of vehicles and objects from the scene\", including ambulances that may have been contaminated while assisting the victims. The public should not be alarmed and there is no evidence to suggest a wide public health risk at this time, the police added. Valery Morozov, a Russian exile, told BBC News that Mr Skripal was working in cyber security. The former Russian military security colonel and his daughter remain in a critical condition at Salisbury District Hospital. Det Sgt Nick Bailey - who attended the scene on Sunday - is conscious but \"very anxious\" about being exposed to a nerve agent. Director of nursing Lorna Wilkinson said Mr Bailey was in a serious but stable condition. Specialist investigators wearing protective suits have been seen examining the bench that Mr Skripal and his daughter collapsed on. Mr Skripal's house and his car have also been cordoned off. It is known that Mr Skripal and his daughter had visited the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found near the Maltings shopping centre. Analysis\nBy Jonathan Beale, BBC defence correspondent Some of the 180 military personnel who have been sent to help the investigation are specialists in chemical biological radiological and nuclear (CBRN) warfare. They include Falcon Squadron from the Royal Tank Regiment, which uses specialist Fuchs vehicles - effectively mobile laboratories - to carry out tests and decontamination. \"Sensitive Site Exploitation\" will look for any further traces of the nerve agent. Royal Marines from 40 Commando have also just completed the UK's biggest chemical warfare exercise - called Toxic Dagger - involving 300 personnel and including scientists from Porton Down. The existence of these units - some of which had suffered under defence cuts - highlights a growing concern in the military about the use of chemical weapons by individuals, terrorist groups and \"rogue states\". But the public is being told not to be alarmed. Many of the military personnel will be working behind the scenes and helping the police with relatively straightforward tasks, such as securing sites and removing objects, including ambulances, for decontamination. Ms Rudd visited some of the sites cordoned off by counter-terrorism police in Salisbury on Friday. She also visited Salisbury District Hospital where Mr Skripal, his daughter, and Mr Bailey are being treated. The home secretary, who met Mr Bailey in hospital, would not give any further details of the nerve agent used or how it was administered. The graves of Mr Skripal's wife and son at a Salisbury cemetery have also been taped off. Mr Skripal, 66, was convicted by the Russian government of passing secrets to MI6, but given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a \"spy swap\". Former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Blair said the \"extraordinary attack in Salisbury\" is a good reason to investigate whether there is a pattern of former British intelligence collaborators dying in the UK. Former First Sea Lord and security minister Lord West said: \"If it is a nation which has done it, it is completely unacceptable. It's almost like an act of war. \"To actually allow something like a nerve agent to be used in another country for some reason is outrageous.\" Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has denied his country's involvement in the attempted murder of the ex-spy. The attempted murder of Mr Skripal has drawn comparisons to the 2006 assassination of Alexander Litvinenko, who ingested the rare and highly radioactive Polonium 210 in London. On Tuesday Labour MP Yvette Cooper asked the home secretary to review 14 other deaths that had not been treated as suspicious by UK police, but have reportedly been identified by US intelligence sources as being connected to the Russian state. Ms Rudd has refused to speculate on whether the Russian state might have been involved in the attack, saying the police investigation should be based on \"facts, not rumour\".

The military personnel - drawn mostly from the Army, but also from the Royal Marines and RAF - are experts in chemical warfare and decontamination.

Those deployed include instructors from the Defence Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Centre and the 29 Explosive Ordnance Group, who are experts in bomb disposal. The military has also sent 18 vehicles. The Metropolitan Police said the counter-terrorism unit has requested the military's assistance \"to remove a number of vehicles and objects from the scene\", including ambulances that may have been contaminated while assisting the victims. The public should not be alarmed and there is no evidence to suggest a wide public health risk at this time, the police added. Valery Morozov, a Russian exile, told BBC News that Mr Skripal was working in cyber security. The former Russian military security colonel and his daughter remain in a critical condition at Salisbury District Hospital.

        "content": "Kenya's president and opposition leader have promised to begin a process of reconciliation following last year's bitterly contested election. Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga called each other \"brothers\" during a surprise joint TV address. Mr Odinga has sworn himself in as the \"people's president\" and refused to recognise Mr Kenyatta as head of state. The announcement came shortly before the arrival of US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Kenya. Until now, both had dismissed calls for talks, from both Kenyans and foreign diplomats. About 150 people were killed in the aftermath of the election, which Mr Kenyatta won after an opposition boycott. In their joint address, President Kenyatta said: \"We will begin a process of discussing what ails us and what creates division amongst us.\" Mr Odinga said it was \"time to resolve our differences\". Pre-emptive PR stunt?\nAnalysis by Ferdinand Omondi, BBC Africa, Nairobi Resolving the two men's differences won't be so easy. Kenya is sharply divided along ethnic lines because of the political stand-off. The opposition charges of rigged elections, police brutality and state high-handedness were not mentioned - only a joint call for national dialogue. Before travelling to Kenya, Rex Tillerson criticised Ethiopia's government for declaring a state of emergency. So some saw this unexpected meeting as a pre-emptive public relations stunt to water down any potential dressing-down; while others welcomed the announcement as long overdue. Whichever explanation rings true, Kenya is headed for an intriguing second episode of political drama. President Kenyatta was sworn in for a second term last November. He won an election re-run in October, which Mr Odinga had boycotted. Elections were first held in August but the courts ordered a re-run, saying Mr Kenyatta's victory was marred by irregularities. Mr Odinga said that nothing had been changed before the re-run. ",

Ahmed Hassan was arrested the day after the bomb partially detonated on a District Line train at Parsons Green on 15 September 2017, injuring many of the 93 passengers on board. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. Det Con James Charalambous said Mr Hassan told him he made the bomb and no-one else was involved. Prosecutors say Ahmed Hassan built the device and set the timer, before leaving it on the train one stop earlier. Explosives expert Sarah Wilson said, had the device fully detonated, it had the potential to be \"lethal\". She told the court the bomb contained 400g of an explosive that with just one gram could cause \"serious injury\". Det Con Charalambous told the Old Bailey he interviewed Mr Hassan at the Port of Dover - where he was arrested - at around 10:15 GMT on 16 September. The Metropolitan Police counter terrorism officer asked the 18-year-old: \"Who made the Tube bomb?\" He is said to have replied: \"I did.\" The officer said that Mr Hassan told police they may also find a small amount of explosives at his home in Sudbury, Surrey. The court then heard that over the next four days the suspect was interviewed seven more times and answered \"no comment\". However, on one occasion he read a prepared statement, which repeated his claim that no-one else was involved in the attack. 'Unstable and unpredictable'\nEarlier, Ms Wilson told the court that tests on the remains of the device showed the explosive chemical compound TATP had been used. The jury heard how just one gram of the chemical compound could cause \"serious injury to people or property\", but that the device had contained around 400g, along with 2.2kg of shrapnel to cause further damage. Ms Wilson described TATP as a \"sensitive primary high explosive\" which is \"very unstable and unpredictable\" - so is not produced for commercial or military use - and the bomb could be detonated just by being dropped. It would have taken several hours to create that amount of the substance, she said, along with the small amount that was discovered at Mr Hassan's foster home in Sunbury, Surrey. Ms Wilson said all the elements necessary for making the bomb were there, but there could have been \"a number of factors\" around why it did not work properly, including whether it was made correctly or if it had become wet. She said: \"My conclusion was there had been a partial explosion. Obviously this device had not fully detonated but something quite violent happened. \"It was likely to be a rapid burn rather than a detonation. \"The initiator mechanism, the battery, has functioned but the main charge had failed to function fully.\" House search\nAnother witness, counter terrorism officer Det Con Matt Rogers, told the court his team discovered the word \"bored\" written repeatedly on the door of Mr Hassan's bedroom when they searched his home on the day after the attack. Officers found a bottle of hydrogen peroxide on his wardrobe, which prosecutors allege he used to make the bomb, and parts of a soldering kit were found underneath his bed. They also discovered a ruler and supermarket loyalty card with traces of TATP on it behind a sofa in the house. 'Trained to kill'\nOn Thursday, the court heard from a number of witnesses to the explosion who described a \"rolling fireball\" coming towards them. The jury also heard about injuries to some of the passengers, including hair being set on fire and clothes melting, after the device partially detonated. On Wednesday, the prosecution also said that Mr Hassan had told Home Office officials, 20 months before the Parsons Green attack, that he had been \"trained to kill\". Prosecutor Alison Morgan said he was interviewed in Croydon in January 2016, where he is alleged to have told officials he had been taken by force by the so-called Islamic State group, who had threatened to kill his uncle and brother if he resisted. The jury has been sent home for the weekend and the trial will continue on Monday. ",

A memorandum of intent on the deal was signed after Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson. BAE said the signing was \"a positive step towards agreeing a contract for our valued partner\". Downing Street said a target of \u00a365bn worth of trade and investment had been agreed during the UK visit. The preliminary order comes two months after BAE announced around 2,000 job cuts because demand for the Typhoon had slowed. Shares in BAE Systems closed up more than 2% in the wake of the announcement although the value of the preliminary deal was not disclosed. BAE chief executive Charles Woodburn said: \"We are committed to supporting the Kingdom as it modernises the Saudi Armed Forces and develops key industrial capabilities critical to the delivery of Vision 2030.\" Saudi Arabia is undertaking an economic and social reform programme under the recently appointed Crown Prince. The Eurofighter Typhoon is the most important fighter jet for BAE and made up close to one-third of aircraft sales in 2016. The aircraft is jointly made by the UK's BAE, France's Airbus and Italy's Leonardo, and supports an estimated 40,000 jobs in the UK. ",

Cameroon international Bong claimed the incident took place during the Baggies' 2-0 win at The Hawthorns on 13 January. Rodriguez appeared to pinch his nose after they clashed and Bong spoke to the referee. Should the 28-year-old - who had until Friday to respond to the Football Association - be found guilty, he will serve a minimum five-match suspension. The case will now be heard by a disciplinary panel at a date to be decided. After he was charged, West Brom said they would \"fully support\" Rodriguez, while the player said he was in \"disbelief at the situation\". The former Burnley and Southampton striker - who has been capped once by England - has continued to protest his innocence and employed top lawyers to defend his case. West Brom manager Alan Pardew said he does not expect the matter to be resolved soon. He said: \"[A hearing] is some way off I think. Obviously he's contesting it. \"He's been a great pro. He's pretty level-headed and I haven't seen too dramatic a change in his attitude to training, or anything if I'm honest.\" ",

On Monday, the Spaniard accepted the Football Association charge for \"wearing a political message\", a breach of kit and advertising regulations. In November, Guardiola said he wore the ribbon to support imprisoned politicians in his native Catalonia. He has also been warned about his future conduct. The FA spoke to the City boss about the situation in December and had previously issued two formal warnings. However, action was taken when he wore it pitchside - he is free to wear it elsewhere - during City's FA Cup fifth-round loss to League One side Wigan on 19 February. Media playback is not supported on this device Two key members of the Catalan independence movement - Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sanchez - were held without bail after an independence vote in October, which the Spanish government deemed illegal. Last month, Guardiola said he would continue to wear the ribbon despite being charged for doing so. He argued that the symbol was \"not about politicians, it's about democracy\". On Sunday, FA chief executive Martin Glenn insisted the ribbon is a political symbol, saying \"it's a symbol of Catalan independence\" and \"we don't want political symbols in football\". Guardiola responded to those comments by saying Glenn \"didn't understand the reality\". The Spaniard did not wear the ribbon during City's Premier League match against Chelsea in the Premier League on Sunday but did so during the news conference afterwards. However, Guardiola wore it during City's Champions League game against Basel on Wednesday as Uefa, European football's governing body, has different rules on political symbols. ",

But she said: \"The continuing failure to follow the most basic of principles of natural justice demonstrates individuals within the Institute that have no understanding as to what amounts to good governance which only serves to utterly undermine any credibility the organisation may lay claim on such issues. \"It is not an organisation I wish to be part of.\" Lady Judge said the recording was made to entrap her. But the BBC understands the IoD's position is that the recording was made by the business lobby group's director general, Stephen Martin, because he thought she might make racist remarks. Mr Martin made the recording without her knowledge. In a discussion about cutting the number of the IoD secretariat, she told Mr Martin that \"the problem is we have one black and one pregnant woman [on the IoD secretariat] and that is the worst combination we could possibly [have]... two blacks and one pregnant woman\". Lady Judge said on Friday she wanted to make clear that she was seeking to have those individuals removed from their positions \"solely on the basis of their performance\" rather than their ethnicity or gender. 'Great job'\nOther parts of the recording indicate she is in favour of promoting diversity. Earlier in the recording, Lady Judge said she had arranged women-only \"cocktail party\" networking events, and she participated in IoD women's conferences. \"It's all part of this agenda, which is to bring in more women,\" she said. Mr Martin then says in the recording: \"One of the other things we're trying to do as well is improve diversity not just for women but for disability, for everything else.\" Lady Judge responds: \"We want to do that too... I think you're doing a great job. I think everybody appreciates the fact that things are getting done. They want change.\" The recording was obtained by the BBC's Joe Lynam. Sir Ken Olisa also resigned from the IoD board. He said: \"Bizarrely, her [Lady Judge's] success and evident commitment to diversity and modernisation seem to have encouraged fervent opposition.\" You may also be interested in:\nOf the IoD secretaries, she said earlier: \"My acknowledgment that issues of race and pregnancy could complicate their removal both legally and from the standpoint of public perception is an observation I believe most lawyers would make, and that many non-lawyers also know to be true. I was addressing the likely consequences of their dismissal, not the reasons for it.\" Lady Judge apologised for the way she had expressed herself in that conversation: \"I realise I expressed myself in a way that sounds crude and insensitive. I regret that and apologise for it.\" She added: \"I, am a woman lawyer who has broken many glass ceilings and who has advocated for women and minority rights my entire life, I'm glad that's the case.\" Her term as chair was due to expire in May, and she was not seeking re-election. In December 2017, Caroline Prosser, an employment lawyer from Hill Dickinson, started to gather evidence in an independent investigation of allegations of racism, sexism, and bullying against Lady Judge. Ms Prosser spoke to 14 complainants, who made 41 allegations. On Friday the IoD suspended Lady Judge as chair pending a further investigation. ",

        "content": "Job creation in the US economy surged last month, but the annual rate of wage growth slowed. The economy created 313,000 jobs in February, official figures show, far in excess of analysts' expectations. However, the unemployment rate remained at 4.1%, while the annual earnings growth rate slowed to 2.6% last month. January's annual wage growth rate - which had triggered fears over inflationary pressures - was also revised down from 2.9% to 2.8%. The strong wage growth figure for January prompted sharp volatility on the stock market, as investors worried the US Federal Reserve would quicken the pace at which it increased interest rates. 'Firing on all cylinders'\nDespite a lower-than-expected wage increase in February, many economists said longer term trends still point to higher wages. US stock markets opened higher in reaction to the US Labor Department's report, which showed the biggest increase in jobs since July 2016. \"We have an economy that is firing on all cylinders and the job market is a reflection of that,\" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Bank. The US economy is in its ninth year of economic expansion, with an upswing in global growth and tax cuts passed last year helping to boost growth. February's gains included an increase of 61,000 construction jobs - the biggest rise since 2007. The manufacturing sector also added 31,000 jobs, while retail employment rebounded from declines last year. The number of people working or looking for work also jumped by more than 800,000 last month. That was the biggest monthly rise in the labour force since 2003 and boosted the labour force participation rate to 63%. Despite the rise, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%, where it has hovered since October. Those figures provided fodder for analysts who say wage growth could be moderated by a large number of potential workers sitting on the sidelines. \"The huge gain in payrolls belies the notion that the [labour] market has truly reached full employment,\" said Sophia Koropeckyj of Moody's Analytics. Increasing participation by men of prime working age - between 25 and 54 years - has helped drive the labour force participation rate higher in recent months, reflecting a resurgence in sectors such as manufacturing. But Ms Koropeckyj said she does not expect the labour force to continue growing at last month's pace, pointing to challenges such as skill gaps and opioid addiction. Americans are also moving less, fuelling a geographic mismatch between jobs and job seekers and hardening regional disparities. \"There's only so much of a boost you can get because a lot of people are structurally unemployed,\" she said. \"Certainly there is slack, but how much of it will be practically absorbed is questionable.\" Rate rise ahead?\nMs Koropeckyj said a tighter labour market makes slow acceleration in wage growth \"inevitable\" this year. The average hourly wage for private sector workers was $26.75 last month, up 68 cents from February 2017 and 4 cents from January. Markets are expecting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at least three times in 2018. But with the inflation rate lagging its target 2% rate, it has been waiting for signs - like strong wage growth - of pricing pressure. Analysts said strong hiring in February all but guarantees the Fed will raise rates at its meeting later this month. But the relatively weak wage growth did little to resolve debates about whether policymakers will eventually move faster. ",

        "content": "Saudi Arabia has moved closer to a deal to buy 48 Typhoon fighter jets, UK aerospace giant BAE Systems has said. A memorandum of intent on the deal was signed after Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson. BAE said the signing was \"a positive step towards agreeing a contract for our valued partner\". Downing Street said a target of \u00a365bn worth of trade and investment had been agreed during the UK visit. The preliminary order comes two months after BAE announced around 2,000 job cuts because demand for the Typhoon had slowed. Shares in BAE Systems closed up more than 2% in the wake of the announcement although the value of the preliminary deal was not disclosed. Aerospace, defence and security industry body ADS welcomed this first step in what would be a multi-billion pound deal. ADS Chief Executive Paul Everitt said: \"The Memorandum of Intent is welcome news for BAE Systems and its UK supply chain, which has a 37.5% workshare on the Typhoon programme.\" BAE chief executive Charles Woodburn said: \"We are committed to supporting the Kingdom as it modernises the Saudi Armed Forces and develops key industrial capabilities critical to the delivery of Vision 2030.\" Saudi Arabia is undertaking an economic and social reform programme under the recently appointed Crown Prince.
